    "content": "Adam Smith, a Scottish philosopher and the initiator of political economy was born on June 5th 1723. Smith is cited as being \u201cthe father of economics\u201d and is still considered one of the most influential figures in economics at present. Adam Smith was born in Kirkcaldy, Fife Scotland as the son of Adam Smith, a lawyer and civil servant and Margaret Douglas who was widowed two months after Smith\u2019s birth. Smith attended Burgh School of Kirkcaldy from 1729 to 1737, studying Latin, mathematics, history and writing. By the age of fourteen, Smith entered into the University of Glasgow and began to study moral philosophy under the instruction of Francis Hutchenson. By 1740 he was awarded with the Snell exhibition and left to begin studies at Balliol College, Oxford. Smith then left Oxford by 1746, just before his scholarship was to end. \n\nAdam Smith began giving public lectures in 1748 at the University of Edinburgh which was sponsored by the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh under the patronage of Lord Kames. A majority of Smith\u2019s lecture topics covered rhetoric, belles-lettres, and the progress of opulence. By 1751, Smith earned a professorship at Glasgow University teaching courses of logic. By 1752 he was an elected member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh and took over the position of head of Moral Philosophy on 1753 when the previous head had passed. \n\nIn 1759, Adam Smith published The Theory of Moral Sentiments exemplifying most of his lectures while at Glasgow University. The literary work mainly concerned how human morality depends on sympathy between the agent and spectator, or in other words, that individual and the other members of society. In this work Smith defined \u201cmutual sympathy\u201d on the basis of moral sentiments. After the publication of this work, Smith become very popular as a thinker and many wealthy students from other countries left their schools to enroll in the University of Glasgow to be instructed under Smith. Preceding the publication of The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith began to attend more towards jurisprudence and economics in his lectures. In his lectures he began to stress that a nation\u2019s wealth lies in the labor rather than the accumulation of gold and silver. \n\nThe University of Glasgow on 1762 conferred the title of Doctor of Laws to Adam Smith. On 1776, Adam Smith\u2019s magnum opus An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations also referred to The Wealth of Nations offered the world a collected description of what builds nations\u2019 wealth and is a fundamental work used today in classical economics. The book was an instant success having its first edition copies sold out within six months of its publication. \n\nSmith was later appointed to a post has a commissioner of customs in Scotland on 1778. He became one of the founding members of the Royal Society of Edinburg five years later when the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh received its royal charter. Then, from 1787 to 1789 Adam Smith took up the honorary position of Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow. Unfortunately, Adam Smith met his demise in 1790 of July 17 in the northern wing of Panmure House in Edinburgh. After his death from a painful illness he was buried in Canongate Kirkyard. While lying on his death bed, Adam Smith expressed a feeling of disappointment that he had not achieved more."

    "name": "Al-Ghazali",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/al-ghazali.jpg",
    "content": "Al-Ghazali was born in 450 AH or between March 1058 to February 1059 CE with the original name of Abu Hamind ibn Muhammad al-Ghazali. To many Westerners he is known as Algazel. Al-Ghazali was a Muslim theologian, jurist, philosopher, and a mystic descending from the Persians. He was born in the town of Tabaran in the district of Tus which is now situated in modern day Iran. Most posthumous traditions began that al-Ghazali\u2019s father had passed away in stark poverty leaving both al-Ghazali and his younger brother Ahmad in the care of a Sufi. Al-Ghazali had begun to receive instruction in Islamic jurisprudence from a local teacher by the name of Ahmad al-Radhakani. He later on went to study the subjects of jurist and theology from al-Juwayni in Nishapur. After the death of al-Juwayni, al-Ghazali left Nishapur and joined the court of Nizam al-Mulk who was then the vizier of Seljuq sultans in Isfahan in 1085. Al-Ghazali was then bestowed the titles of \u201cBrilliance of the Religion\u201d and \u201cEminence among the Religious Leaders\u201d. By 1091 Nizam al-Mulk promoted Ghazali to the professorship in Nizamiyya madrasa in Baghdad. \n\nAl-Ghazali went through a spiritual crisis in 1095 abandoning his career in Baghdad and heading for a pilgrimage to Mecca. He spent some time Damascus and Jerusalem, with a visit to Mecca and Medina in 1096. In 1096 al-Ghazali returned to Tus spending the next several years in seclusion which consisted of abstaining from state-sponsored teachings. However, al-Ghazali continued to publish works, received visitors, and taught in private madrasas and Sufi monasteries which he had built. The grand vizier to Ahmad Sanjar, Fahr al-Mulk insisted Ghazali to return to Nizamiyya in Nishapur, however Ghazali gave up in 1106 to the requests.\n\nDuring al-Ghazali\u2019s life he wrote more than 70 books on science, Islamic philosophy and Sufism. Al-Ghazali published his book The Incoherence of Philosophers, this is marked as the turning point in Islamic epistemology. The encounter he had with skepticism led al-Ghazali to form a belief that all events and interactions are not the product of material conjunctions but instead are the present and immediate Will of God. Another of al-Ghazali\u2019s most renowned work is Ihya\u2019 Ulum al-Din or The Revival of Religious Sciences. The work covers almost all fields of Islamic science. This includes Islamic jurisprudence, theology, and Sufism. The book has received many positive criticisms. Al-Ghazali then wrote an abridged version of the The Revivial of Religious Sciences in Persian under the title Kimiya-yi sa\u2019adat also known as The Alchemy of Happiness. Even though al-Ghazali has mentioned that he has wrote more than 70 books, presently there are more than 400 books that are attributed to him. \n\nAl-Ghazali had a significant influence on both Muslim and Christian medieval philosophers. One of the most influenced was St. Thomas Aquinas. Al-Ghazali also played a major role in amalgamating Sufism and Shariah. He was the first to combine the concepts of Sufism into Shariah laws and the first to give a formal description of Sufism in his works. The works of al-Ghazali strengthen the stance of Sunni Islam compared to other schools of thought.\n\nAl-Ghazali returned to Tus in 1110 and declined the invitation of the grand vizier of Muhammad I to return to Baghdad. According to most historians\u2019 al-Ghazali passed in the year 1111 on the 18th of December."

    "content": "Alan Mathison Turing was born on June 23, 1912. Turing was a British mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, and computer scientist. Turing has been noted as being highly influential in the development of computer science. He was born in London to father Julius Mathison Turing and mother Ethel Sara. He had an elder brother John Turing. Due to Turing father being active in civil service, the couple travelled between England and India leaving both their sons to be cared for by a retired Army couple. Turing was first enrolled into St. Michael\u2019s, a day school and then into Leonards-on-Sea at the age of six. In 1926 when Turning had reached the age of thirteen, he attended Sherborne School. After completing studies at Sherborne, Turing was accepted to King\u2019s College, Cambridge from 1931 to 1934 as an undergraduate where he earned a first class honors in Mathematics. \n\nBy the age of 22, Turing was elected as a fellow at King\u2019s due to the strength of his dissertation on the central limit theorem. The \u201cTuring\u201d machine was invented in 1936 by Alan Turing who named it as \u201ca-machine\u201d; automatic machine. It is a hypothetical device that manipulates symbols on a stripe of tape in regards to a table of rules. It was used to stimulate logic of computer algorithms and to explain the functions of a CPU inside a computer. Later on from 1936 to 1938, Turing spent his time studying under Alonzo Church at Princeton University. He obtained his PhD from Princeton University in 1938 for his dissertation Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals. In the dissertation he introduced the concept of ordinal logic and relative computing. Turing then returned to Cambridge University where he began to attend lectures by Ludwig Wittgenstein that were about the foundations of mathematics. He also began working part-time with the Government Code and Cypher School (GCCS). \n\nTuring became the leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park during World War II. He concentrated on Cryptanalysis of the Enigma with the senior GCCS code breaker Dilly Knox. When the United Kingdom had declared war on Germany in 1939, Turing was reported to Bletchley Park which was the wartime station of GCCS. He used crib-based decryption to produce the functional specification of the \u201cbombe\u201d. Other wartime advances that Turing made were deducing the indicator procedure used by German navy; developing a statistical process for making more efficient bombes which were named Bnburismus; developed process for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the Lorenz SZ 40/42 which was named Turingery. During the end of the war, he developed a secure voice scrambler at Hanslope Park which was then code named Delilah. Turing made a major contribution to the code breaking process. Discussing mathematical approaches to code breaking were written in his papers report on the application of probability to cryptography and Paper on statistics of repetitions. Both these papers were of such value to the GCCS and later its successor GCHQ that they were not released to the UK National Archives until April 2012. Turing was awarded the OBE by King George VI for his wartime services on 1945; however, his work for that time remained a secret for many years. \n\nTuring was found dead by his cleaner on June 8 1945. Post-mortem reports established that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning."

His services as a volunteer programmer at KPFA, a Pacifica Radio station in Berkeley made him a very famous figure in San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nAlan was born as Alan Wilson Watts on\u00a0January 6, 1915 in Chislehurst, Kent, England. Alan belonged to a middle class family, his father was employed at the London office of Michelin Tyre Company, while his mother was a housewife. His mother\u2019s devout religiousness had a meaningful impact on his upbringing. Alan attended the King\u2019s School in Canterbury and during his teen years, he was presented with the opportunity to travel to France along with wealthy Epicurean, Francis Croshaw. Croshaw also influenced Alan with his Buddhist beliefs and practices. \u00a0After completing his secondary education, he briefly worked in a painting house, and later, at a bank. Watts\u2019 interests were piqued by philosophy, he began extensively reading works of philosophy, history, psychology, psychiatry and Eastern wisdom. He encountered influential spiritual authors who had a profound impact in shaping his ideologies, such as, Nicholas Roerich, Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan and theosophists like Alice Bailey.\n\nAlan learned Chinese, and did significant research in Zen Buddhism and the fundamental beliefs and practices of religions and philosophies of India and East Asia. Alan was a prominent member of the London Buddhist Lodge, and in 1931, he was appointed the secretary of the organization. In 1936, he attended the World Congress of Faiths at the University of London, where he heard D.T. Suzuki, a prominent scholar of Zen Buddhism, who had a strong influence on his thoughts. The same year, inspired by the works of Suzuki, Watts published his first book, \u201cThe Spirit of Zen\u201d. In 1938, he moved to America and began training in Zen Buddhism, however, unsatisfied with the methods of the teacher, he left Zen training. Alan then enrolled himself in the Anglican school of Sea-bury Western Theological Seminary in Evanston, Illinois, where he studied Christian scriptures, theology and Church history and he received his Master\u2019s degree in theology. His thesis was published under the title, \u201cBehold the Spirit: A Study in the Necessity of Mystical Religion\u201d.\n\nIn 1951, Alan Watts settled in California upon accepting a position in the faculty of the American Academy of Asian Studies in San Francisco. He was also on the administration board of the academy for several years. During his stay at the Academy, he instructed himself in written Chinese as well as, Chinese brush calligraphy. Watts left the Academy to embark on a freelance career, and in 1953, he began his career as a radio programmer for the Pacifica Radio Station KPFA in Berkeley.\n\nIn 1957, Watts published his highly acclaimed and much discussed book which rose to the status of international bestseller, titled \u201cThe Way of Zen\u201d, which dealt with the philosophical fundamentals and history of Zen Buddhism. During his travels to Europe, Alan encountered eminent psychiatrist, Carl Jung, and on his return to America, Watts began exploring the subject matter of modern science and psychology, aiming to establish an alignment between mystical experiences and material theories of the universe. He also began taking psychedelic drugs. He published his famous book, \u201cTao: The Watercourse Way\u201d, which firmly established him as a prominent Zennist. He also produced an audio series, \u201cOut of Our Mind\u201d, where he discussed diverse subjects such as arts, cuisine, child rearing, education, law and freedom, architecture and sexuality.\n\nAlan Watts composed more than 25 books on diverse topics such as cybernetics, semantics, process philosophy, natural history, the anthropology of sexuality, and Eastern and Western religion. Some of his famous books include \u201cThe Way of Zen\u201d (1957), \u201cPsychotherapy East and West\u201d (1961), \u201cThe New Alchemy\u201d (1958) \u201cThe Legacy of Asia and Western Man\u201d (1937), \u201cThe Meaning of Happiness\u201d (1940) and \u201cThe Joyous Cosmology\u201d (1962) among others."

Camus was brought up in poor living standard in Belcourt section of Algiers. He is a known French Noble Prize winning author, journalist, and philosopher. In 1923, he was accepted into the lycee and then admitted to the University of Algiers. In 1930, he was diagnosed to contracting tuberculosis which ended his football activities in the University as well as made him study part-time. In order to earn a living, Camus took several odd jobs that included; private tutor, car parts clerk, and an assistant at the Meteorological Institute. In 1935, he successfully completed is licence de philosophie BA and went on to complete his diploma d\u2019etudes superieures which is equivalent to a MA with his thesis on Plotinus, Neo-Platonisme et Pensee Chretienne translated into English as Neo-Platonism and Christian Thought. \n\nIn 1935, Albert Camus had joined the French Communist Party as way to fight the Europeans for equality for the natives of Algeria. In 1936, he joined the Algerian Communist Party and then later joined the Algerian People\u2019s Party. After being denounced as a Trotskyite in 1937 he was expelled from the party and went on to join the French anarchist movement. Camus went on to write for the anarchist publications such as Le Libertaire, La revolustion Proletarienne and Solidaridad Obrera. \n\nHe married to Simone Hie, a morphine addict in 1934; however the marriage ended quite soon. In 1935 Camus had founded Theatre du Travail, known as the Worker\u2019s Theatre and later renamed it to Theatre de l\u2019Equipe known as the Team\u2019s Theatre around 1937.

He finished his book both The Stranger and The Myth of Sisyphus, returning to Oran, Algeria in 1942 here became the editor of the newspaper Combatin. In 1949, Camus\u2019s TB had returned and he began to live in seclusion for two years that followed. By 1951, Camus published The Rebel which was a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which he expressed his rejection of communism. \n\nCamus\u2019s first main contribution to philosophy was his introduction to the \u201cidea of the absurd\u201d. He explained it to be a result of a person\u2019s desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither. This was mainly discussed in his work The Myth of Sisyphus and also was seen in The Stranger and The Plague. By the 1950\u2019s Camus devoted much of his time to human rights.

He is ranked among the prominent German philosophers and theologians of the middle Ages, he was given the title of \u201cDoctor Universalis\u201d for his innovative contributions to medieval science and philosophy, and for demonstrating a concrete link between scientific study and religion. He is considered the first medieval philosopher to combine contemporary Christian thought with Aristotelian philosophy.\n\nAlbertus Magnus was born in 1193 in Lauingen, Bavaria. He belonged to an affluent family, and was the eldest son of Count Bollstadt. He received his early education at Padua, Italy, where he was instructed in the works of Aristotle. In 1223, he became a member of the Dominican order, and began studying theology under the Dominicans at Bologna and later in Cologne. Upon the completion of his education, he began teaching theology in Cologne. In 1245, he decided to move to Paris, where he received his doctorate, and soon established himself as a prominent teacher. In 1248, Magnus was appointed to organize the new Studium General (House of Studies) in Cologne, and Magnus was made the regent of the institution.\n\nIn 1250, Magnus served the General Chapter of the Dominicans, he along with Aquinas and Peter of Tarentasia, formulated the rules for the course of education and system of graduation in the Dominican order. In 1254, he was elected as the provincial of the Dominican Order in Germany, however, he resigned in 1257, and devoted his time to teaching and studying. In 1260, Pope Alexander IV appointed him as the Bishop of Regensburg. However, he resigned from this post in 1261, to resume his professorship and education.

He was the most widely read author of his time, labelled as \u201cDoctor Universalis\u201d for his encyclopedic knowledge. He compiled more than seventy books and papers, and in 1899, his writings were put together in 38 volumes. He also did some pioneering work in astronomy, including the realization that the Milky Way consists of stars. His written works include \u201cPhysica\u201d, \u201cSumma Theolagiae\u201d and De Natura Locorum\u201d."

Anaximenes was the first Greek philosopher to form a clear distinction between planets and stars, and to provide scientific explanations to account for natural events such as thunder, lightning, rainbows, earthquakes etc.\n\nAnaximenes was born in 585 BC to Eurystratos in Greek city of Miletus, located in Ionia. Anaximenes was a pupil and companion of Anaximander, however, some say that he was also a pupil of Parmenides of Elea. He spent a brief period of his life under Persian rule, therefore, he was a witness to the horrors of the Ionian rebellion against Greek occupation.\n\nAnaximenes\u2019 devoted his philosophical energies to the intellectual pursuit of identifying the single source of the basis of the universe. Anaximenes was confident that indeed there was a single element that controlled the course of the universe, and he deemed that element to be air. He proposed that everything is air at different levels of density, air\u2019s characteristic of infinity and perpetual motion lends it the ability to produce all things without being produced by anything.\n\nAnaximenes described the earth as a broad disk, floating on the circumambient air. He believed that the formation of the sun and stars was also due to the processes of condensation and rarefaction, and these bodies developed their flaming characteristics due to the velocity of their motions. He used a similar explanation for the natural phenomena such as thunder and lightning, which he described as a result of wind breaking out of clouds, he described rainbows as the result of the rays of the sun falling on clouds, earthquakes result due to the cracking of the earth when it dries out after being moistened by rain, hail is caused by frozen rainwater etc."

    "content": "Aristotle was born on 384 BCE; he is a famous Greek philosopher and polymath. Aristotle was the student Plato and went on to become the teacher of Alexander the Great. The works of Aristotle cover various subjects ranging from: logic, music, theater, metaphysics, physics, poetry, politics, biology, ethics, government, linguistics, and zoology. He is known as the founding figures of Western philosophy. It was Aristotle\u2019s writing that created a comprehensive system of Western philosophy which included various topics such as morality, aesthetics, logic, science, metaphysics, and politics. Medieval scholarship was profoundly formed from the views that he contributed in regards to physical sciences.\n\nAristotle was born in Stagira, Chalcidice around the time of 384 BCE. His father, Nicomachus, was a personal physician to King Amyntas of Macedon. Very little information is found by historian on the childhood that was spent by Aristotle. However, it is hypothesized that he spent some of time in the palace of Macedonia. By the age of eighteen he had travelled to Athens in order to continue his education at Plato\u2019s Academy. Aristotle attended the academy for twenty years before leaving Athens around 348 BCE. After the death of Plato, Aristotle felt that there was increased tension and anti-Macedonian sentiments within the Academy. Therefore, Aristotle and Xenocrates travelled to the court of their friend Hermias of Atarneus who was situated in Asia Minor. While spending time in Asia Minor, Aristotle travelled the island of Lesbos where he researched botany and zoology of the island. During this time he married Hermias\u2019s niece, who was considered the adotive daughter Pythias. After the death of the Hermias in 343 B.C., Aristotle had been invited by Philip II of Macedon to become the tutor of his son Alexander. It was during this time that he was appointed as the head of the royal academy located in Macedon. Lessons were not just given to Alexander, but to two other future kings who included Ptolemy and Cassanger.\n\nAristotle returned to Athens on 335 BCE where he established a school known as Lyceum. For the next twelve years, Aristotle was the one that conducted courses in the established school. During this time period of 335 BCE and 323 BCE, it is believed by many historians that Aristotle began to compose a majority of his works. Most of the surviving works are in the form of treatise and they include some of the most important and influential work of modern western philosophy. The list of works include: Physics, Metaphysics, Nicomachean Ethics, Politics, de Anima, and Peotics. Aristotle studied almost all the subjects that were available during that time and also contributed significantly to those fields. They include: anatomy, astronomy, embryology, geology, meteorology, physics, zoology, and geography. He contributed to philosophical writings in aesthetics, ethics, government, metaphysics, politics, economics, psychology, rhetoric, and even theology. It is Aristotle\u2019s combined works that compose the virtual encyclopedia Greek knowledge.\n\nOnce again, anti-Macedonian sentiments as arose in Athens after the death of Alexander the Great. This forced Aristotle to flee the city to his mother\u2019s home in Chalcis. Aristotle died in 322 BCE in Eubeo of natural causes. He left the chief executor his former student Antipater. The will left by Aristotle stated that he wanted to be buried right next to his wife."

Schopenhauer\u2019s theories were influenced by the philosophies of Plato and Immanuel Kant, his teachings brought him in constant academic rivalry with Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.\n\nArthur Schopenhauer was born on\u00a0February 22, 1788, in Danzig, Poland. He was born into an affluent German family, his father, Heinrich Floris Schopenhauer was a successful merchant, while his mother, Johanna Troisner was a writer. His parents had moved to Hamburg in 1793, upon Prussia\u2019s annexation of Danzig. In 1805, Arthur\u2019s father ended his life by committing suicide. From then on, his mother took over his upbringing, and in 1807, Arthur was enrolled in a gymnasium in Gotha. Later, he was placed under the tutelage of the famous Greek philosopher, Franz Passow, who instructed him in classical studies. Two years later, he became fluent in Greek and Latin. At the age of 21, he inherited one-third of the paternal estate which allotted him a fixed income of his own. In 1809, Arthur was accepted at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where he pursued a degree in medicine. He also studied philosophy under the direction of G.E. Schulze, who regularly assigned him philosophical readings, his interests were especially peaked by the works of Plato and Immanuel Kant, and they had a significant influence in shaping his ideologies.\n\nIn 1813, Schopenhauer received his Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Jena. The same year, he published his first book, titled \u201cUber die vierfache Wurzel des Satzes vom zureichenden Grunde\u201d. Later that year, he decided to return to Weimar, where his mother had established a reputed literary salon, that was frequented by influential literary figures, such as Johann Wolfgang van Goethe, who inspired Schopenhauer\u2019s work in \u201cOn Vision and Colours\u201d, published in 1816.\n\nIn 1816, Schopenhauer published his most remarkable and highly applauded work, titled \u201cDie Welt als Wille und Vorstellung\u201d (The World as Will and Representation), which has influenced economic thought for centuries. The book was published in four volumes, the first book dealt with the \u2018Idea\u2019 that is described as a product of science and experience, and revolves around the concept of logic. The second volume deals with the \u2018Will\u2019, and describes how the will imposes itself on the world, the third volume discusses the \u2018Platonic Idea\u2019 which says that the idea does not depend on the principle of logic, and lastly, the fourth volume deals with the ethical connotations of the acceptance or rejection of the will. This book was very well received and praised, and it firmly established Schopenhauer as a gifted writer and eminent philosopher.\n\nIn 1820, he accepted a teaching position at the University of Berlin, where his teachings came into striking contrast with those of Hegel\u2019s, hence, this gave way to an academic battle of opposing ideologies, which consequently drove Arthur away from academia.\n\nIn 1833, he moved to Frankfurt, and lived there for the next 30 years, all by himself and the company of his pet cats and poodles. He devoted his time to research and reading, and in 1847, he published a revised version of his early works, titled \u201cOn the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason\u201d. In 1851, he published an essay, titled \u201cOf Women\u201d, where he described women as incapable of decision making and rationality, and termed them as the \u201cweaker sex\u201d. He also composed several writings on aging, which were later published as \u201cSenilia\u201d. Arthur Schopenhauer passed away due to heart failure on September 21, 1860, at the age of 72."

    "content": "Born as Isdore Auguste Marie Francois Xavier Comte on January 19, 1798 in Montpellier, France, Auguste Comte was a French philosopher, acclaimed for being the founder of positivism and sociology. He is accredited for naming the science of sociology and giving a system to the subject. Comte was significantly influenced by philosophers that were starting to distinguish and map out an order in human society\u2019s history. Many of these influential philosophers were his contemporaries including Montesquieu, Joseph de Maistre and Marquis de Condorcet, all of whom contributed to Comte\u2019s system of thought.\n\nThe start of Comte\u2019s career came after acquaintance with the French social reformer Henri de Saint-Simon. Many of Comte\u2019s early written articles were published in Saint-Simon\u2019s circulations though he broke off from Saint-Simon\u2019s ideology in 1826 due to differing point of views. It was also during this time that Comte commenced a series of lectures dedicated to his system of positive philosophy for private audiences. Between 1829 and 1830 the success of his lectures were delivered to the Royal Athenaeum. The years from 1830 to 1840 were devoted to the writing and publication of Comte\u2019s philosophical work entitled, Cours de Philosophie Positive, translated into English as The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte, a six volume publication.\n\nOne of Auguste Comte\u2019s major work, Systeme de Politique Positive, translated in English as System of Positive Policy was written after the death of his romantic interest Clotilde de Vaux published between 1851 and 1854. In this work Comte, completed his formulation of the subject of sociology. This major work of Comte laid heavy emphasis on the progress of morality as being the main fixation for human knowledge.\n\nThe emergence of Comte\u2019s ideas can been seen as a further indulgence into the ideas of writers from the 18th and early 19th century such as David Hume and Immanuel Kant. The philosophy of positivism contributed by Comte laid under five distinct parts. These parts included is adoption of the scientific method, the law of three stages, classification of science, contribution to philosophies of sciences from anterior to sociology, the creation of positivist social philosophy.\n\nEven though Comte is not credited\u00a0for the originating the ideas of sociology, he has to his credit the extension of this field of study and systematization its content. Comte successfully divided sociology into two main fields of social statics and social dynamics. According to Comte\u2019s view the foundation of society is based on\u00a0a person\u2019s individual egoism. According to his thought this is done by division of labor with the combination of a person\u2019s efforts as well as maintaining the social unity that is the responsibility of the government and the state.\n\nAuguste Comte died due to\u00a0cancer on September 5, 1857 in Paris, France."

Rand\u2019s theories dealt with ethical egoism, where she rejected the ideas of collectivism, fascism, communism, socialism, in short, the concept of a welfare state.\u00a0 She introduced the philosophical discipline of Objectivism, which she describes as the idea of man being his own heroic aspiration along \u201c\u2026with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute\u201d.\n\nAyn Rand was born as Alisa Zinov\u2019yevna Rosenbaum, on\u00a0February\u00a02,\u00a01905, to parents Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum and Anna Borisovna Rosenbaum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. She belonged to a capitalist family, and was the eldest of three sisters. Her family was Jewish, although, liberal in their religious practices. Twelve year old Ayn was a conscious observer of the Russian Revolution of 1917, which had unfavorable political implications for her family. The success of Lenin\u2019s Bolshevik Party led to the confiscation of Ayn\u2019s father\u2019s pharmacy, and her family was soon left with no choice but to seek refuge in Crimea. Ayn attended high school in Crimea, and at the age of 16, she returned to Saint Petersburg.\n\nAyn was accepted at the Petrograd State University, where she studied at the department of social pedagogy, and pursued a degree in history. She began educating herself in the works of Plato and Aristotle, which laid the basis of his philosophical thoughts on state and politics. During her stay at the university, Rand educated herself in French, German and Russian, and soon, began devouring the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Victor Hugo, Edmond Rostand, and Friedrich Schiller, who became her particular favorites.\n\nWhen she was nearing the completion of her graduation, Rand, along with other fellow bourgeois students, was suspended from the University.

    "content": "Baruch Spinoza, a renowned Dutch philosopher, whose radical ideologies laid the foundation of the school of Spinozism. Spinoza was ranked among the most influential philosophers and notable rationalists of the 17th century, his masterpiece, \u201cThe Ethics\u201d, which questioned the traditional beliefs and conceptions of God, humans, nature, and the entire universe as a whole, firmly established his positions as a prominent influence on Western Philosophy and Thought. His controversial beliefs on theology and moral practices brought him in the midst of broiling conflict and controversy with the Jewish and Christian communities. However, in the 18th and 19th century, his work began garnering praise and approval.\n\nBaruch de Spinoza was born on November 24, 1632, to parents Miguel de Espinoza and Ana Debora in Amsterdam, Dutch Republic. His father worked as a prosperous Portuguese Sephardic Jewish merchant, and Baruch was raised in a traditional Jewish setup. He was enrolled in the Keter Torah Yeshiva for his early education, and was also coached in languages, young Baruch gained proficiency in Portuguese, Hebrew, Spanish, French, Dutch and Latin. Spinoza\u2019s mother passed away when he was only six years old.\n\nBaruch was a brilliant student, and he showed aspirations to become a rabbi. However, the untimely death of his elder brother in 1650, forced him to give up his education and join the family business. In 1653, he resumed his studies, and began taking Latin classes from Frances van den Enden. Frances encouraged Spinoza to engage in free thinking, and welcome the ideas of scholastic and modern philosophy. His father passed away in 1654, Baruch declined his share of the inheritance, which passed on to his sister. He ran the family business for a short period of time, however, he encountered a severe financial crisis during the first Anglo-Dutch war, and he relinquished himself of the cares of the business by declaring himself an orphan. Upon inheriting financial assistance from his mother\u2019s estate, Spinoza devoted his time to philosophical and optical pursuits, and began exploring rationalism and the anti-clerical sect of Remonstrants.\n\nHis anti-theologian and radical teachings against the traditional doctrines of the Church led an imposition of a ban on him by the Talmud Torah congregation in 1656. He continued his criticism of the traditional religious practices unfazed, and soon became regarded as the first secular Jew of modern Europe. Eventually, he was exiled from Amsterdam, following which, he stayed in the village of Ouderkerk aan de Amstel for a while. In 1660, he settled in Rinjnsburg, Leiden, and devoted his time to composing most of his highly acclaimed literary work. In 1663, he published his first essay, titled \u201cShort Treatise on God, Man and His Well-Being\u201d, which dealt with his metaphysical, epistemological and moral teachings. He also published his work on Descartes\u2019 \u201cPrinciples of Philosophy\u201d soon after.\n\nThe same year, he moved to Voorburg, where began collaborating with several philosophers, scientists and theologians for the compilation of his latest work, \u201cThe Ethics\u201d. Meanwhile, he also provided his services as a lens-grinder and instrument maker in order to earn his daily bread and butter. Simultaneously, he also began working on \u201cTheological Political Treatise\u201d, which analysed secular and constitutional governments was published in 1670. This treatise drew a lot of criticism, and in 1674, it was legally banned.\n\nIn 1670, Spinoza moved to The Hague, where he continued working on his political treatise, and other essays including \u2018On the Rainbow\u2019 and \u2018On the Calculation of Chances\u2019. He also began composing a Dutch translation of the Bible, and another unfinished Hebrew work, which he later destroyed. In 1676, he finished compiling and published his magnum opus, \u201cThe Ethics\u201d.\n\nThe same year, his health started deteriorating, and it worsened the next year. After a prolonged struggle against lung illness, Baruch Spinoza passed away on\u00a0February 20, 1677. He was buried in the churchyard of the Christian Nieuwe Kerk in The Hague."

    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/bertrand-russell.jpg",
    "content": "Bertrand Russell ranks among the notable British philosophers, logicians, mathematicians, historians and social critics. His pioneering work has laid down the foundations of analytic philosophy. Russell was an enthusiastic anti-war activist, and he was among the very few who openly raised voice against Adolf Hitler and criticized Stalinist totalitarianism. His literary contributions have led to the evolution of the disciplines of logic, mathematics, set theory, linguistics, philosophy of language, epistemology and metaphysics.\n\nBertrand Russell was born as Bertrand Arthur William Russell, the third Earl Russell on May 18, 1872, to parents Viscount Amberley and Katharine Louisa, at Ravenscroft, Trellech, Monmouth shire, Wales. Russell hailed from a liberal aristocratic family, which had an influential role to play in major political happenings. In 1874, Russell\u2019s mother and sister died of diphtheria, and soon after, in 1876, his father, too, died of bronchitis. Bertrand, along with his brother Frank, was placed under the guardianship of his Victorian grandparents, who lived at the Pembroke Lodge in Richmond Park. His grandfather passed away shortly after, and his grandmother took over the upbringing of the two boys.\n\nRussell was not enrolled in a school, instead he was schooled at home under the supervision of several tutors. Russell\u2019s childhood was marked by seclusion, and this isolation made him a depressed teenager, who often tried to commit suicide. However, soon he came across the work of Euclid, which marked a great turning point in his life. He began educating himself in the works of eminent philosophers and thinkers, Percy Bysshe Shelley was a particular favourite of his. Bertrand was offered a scholarship to read for the Mathematical Tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge, and in 1890, he began studying there. At Cambridge, Russell encountered Alfred North Whitehead, who introduced him to the Cambridge Apostles. In a brief period of time, Russell gained incredible prowess in mathematics and philosophy, and in 1893, he graduated as a High Wrangler. In 1895, he was appointed a Fellow in Philosophy at the university.\n\nIn 1896, Russell began publishing his work on German Social Democracy, a political treatise that turned out to be lifelong engrossment in social and political theory. The same year, he began teaching German Social Democracy at the London School of Economics. Russell was accepted as a member at the \u201cCoefficients Dining Club\u201d, a society of social reformers established in 1902, by Sidney and Beatrice Webb, the Fabian campaigners. At Trinity College, Russell devoted his time to mathematical quest of knowledge, and he began to formulate a \u201cRussell\u2019s Paradox\u201d, that challenged the basis of the set theory. In 1903, he published his first book dealing with mathematical logic, titled \u201cThe Principles of Mathematics\u201d. The book described mathematics as a science based on very few principles and largely tied together through logic and reasoning.\n\nIn 1905, he published his highly praised essay, \u201cOn Denoting\u201d, in the philosophical journal, Mind. In 1908, he was made a member of the Royal Society. Russell, in collaboration with Whitehead, began composing the book \u201cPrincipia Mathematica\u201d, the first three volumes of this treatise were published in 1910. These books garnered immense critical and global recognition, and firmly established Russell as a prominent mathematician and philosopher. In 1910, Russell accepted the position of lecturer at the University of Cambridge.\n\nDuring the WWI, Russell was among the very few philosophers who were actively involved in pacifist activities. Due to his opinions, in 1916, he was forced to resign from Trinity College, and under the \u2018Defence of the Realm Act\u2019, he was also fined 100 pounds. On his denial to pay the fine, his books were sold off in an auction to raise money. In 1919, Russell was offered his position back, he accepted but resigned again, a year later. In 1926, he was appointed as a Tarner Lecturer, and later in 1944, he was made a Fellow again. Russell was accused of lecturing against the US\u2019s entry in the war to aid Britain in public, he was subjected to six months in Brixton prison. He was released in September 1918.\n\nIn 1920, Russell visited Russia as a part of an official delegation commissioned by the British government to probe and examine the effects of the Russian Revolution. He wrote a book on the experiences of his trip to Russia, titled \u201cThe Practice and Theory of Bolshevism\u201d. Russell has been the recipient of several awards and accolades, such as the Order of Merit, the Nobel Prize in Literature, and the Jerusalem Prize among others.\n\nHe passed away on February 2, 1970 in Penrhyndeudraeth, Merionethshire, Wales. According to the directions laid down by his will, his ashes were spread over the Welsh mountains and no religious ceremony took place."

    "name": "Cesare Beccaria",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/cesare-beccaria.jpg",
    "content": "Cesare Beccaria ranked amongst the most remarkable intellectual minds of the Enlightenment era of the 18th century. His literary contributions have led to ground-breaking evolution in the fields of economics and criminology.\n\nCesare was born on March 15, 1738, in Milan, Italy. He hailed from an aristocratic family of the Austrian Habsburg Empire, however, his father had modest financial means. For his early education, Cesare was sent to Parma, where he attended a Jesuit school. He was not particularly content in the environment of the school, and often described his education at the school as \u201cfanatical\u201d and intolerant towards \u201cdevelopment of human feelings\u201d. Despite his discontentment with the school\u2019s curriculum, Cesare proved himself a brilliant student and particularly excelled in mathematics. Since a very young age, Cesare began to show a tendency for rapid mood swings. His mood would go from avid zeal to bouts of fury in a matter of seconds, without any logical explanation, and he would end up depressed and sluggish for days at times. Cesare was a shy person, and did not find it easy to socialize in gatherings, however, he enjoyed a very lovable relationship with his family and close friends. After the completion of his primary education, he was accepted at the University of Parma, where he pursued a legal education, and received his law degree in 1758.\n\nIn the early 1760s, Cesare, along with his close companions Pietro and Alessandro Verri, laid down the foundation of a society dedicated to the reformation of the economic, political and administrative systems, titled \u201cThe Academy of Fists\u201d. This society was based on the principals of the Enlightenment and its motive was \u201cwaging relentless war against economic disorder, bureaucratic tyranny, religious narrow-mindedness, and intellectual pedantry.\u201d To develop an in depth understanding of the tyrannical forces they were at war against, Cesare began studying the French and British writings on the Enlightenment, and in 1762, he published his own analysis of the economic disruption, entitled \u201cOn Remedies for the Monetary Disorders of Milan in the Year 1762\u201d. This composition was his first publication, and it enjoyed immense critical success.\n\nCesare continued writing for the society, and in 1764, he published his most acclaimed and thought-provoking essay, titled \u201cOn Crimes and Punishments\u201d. The essay dealt with Cesare\u2019s analysis of the legal system of his time, and he explored the various shortcomings of this system. In this essay, he describes the then-prevailing criminal justice system as \u201cbarbaric\u201d and \u201cantiquated\u201d, and concluded that such laws should be formulated that equally protect the interests of the criminals as well as victims. He proposed and discussed how these particular laws must be formulated, who should formulate them and how they will benefit the entire society. Cesare advocated the need of just yet, sufficing punishments, and moreover, he emphasized the need for setting a particular criteria or punishment for each type of crime. The treatise also proposed several crime-prevention strategies, and assigned specific roles to be played by the various members of the court.\n\nHowever, in fear of controversy and government disapproval, he chose to publish this essay anonymously. Despite his fears, the essay won immense approval, not only from Italy but various other parts of the world, as far as the United States. Catherine the Great is said to have publicly praised it, and the founders of the US, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams have cited it on numerous occasions during their speeches. Upon garnering the approval of such eminent personalities, Cesare decided to republish it under his own name.\n\nCesare Beccaria\u2019 theories on criminal justice revolved around three main components: rational manner, free will and manipulability. He was a strong advocate of free will as being the ability to make choices, and he believed that individual must apply reasoning and logic while making decisions in order to achieve fulfilment and self-satisfaction. He believed that law and order existed to serve the society, and to uphold the values of the social contract. However, according to him, when people give preference to their personal goals and acted with self-centeredness, they often become engaged in crimes to fulfil their wants and hence, they break societal laws.\n\nCesare introduced the concept of manipulability, which he describes as the predictable ways individuals act rationally in pursuit of their interests, and this implementation of logic prevents them from violating the social contract and committing crimes, as they view crime as an irrational choice, its negative consequences far exceeding its benefits.\n\nCesare always encouraged and enjoyed his fascination with the field of economics and in 1768, he embarked on building a career in economics by accepting the position of the Chair in Public Economy and Commerce at the Palatine School in Milan. He also served as a lecturer at the Palatine School for the next two years. Through the notes formulated during his lectures, Cesare composed an economic analysis, titled \u201cElements of Public Economy\u201d. The treatise was published in 1804, ten years after his death, and dealt with previously undiscovered topics such as the division of labor.\n\nCesare also served the Supreme Economic Council of Milan, where he made tireless efforts to bring about economics reforms. He gave great emphasis on solving the problems of public education and labor relations. While in office, he constructed a report on the series of strategies that led to France\u2019s implementation of the metric system. Cesare enjoyed immense success in his economic career, however, it failed to surpass his fame as a criminologist. In 1790, he served on a committee based in Lombardy, that was dedicated to the reformation of civil and criminal law.\n\nDuring his final years, Cesare became increasingly disturbed by the horrific activities of the French Revolution, and slowly began to slip into excessive depression and social withdrawal. He passed away on\u00a0November 28, 1794, in his native city of Milan."

    "content": "Charles Sander Peirce, an eminent philosopher, scientist and logician was born on\u00a0September 10, 1839, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was son of the prominent scientist, Benjamin Charles Sanders Pierce, who was also a professor of mathematics at Harvard. Charles was raised in an intellectual environment stimulated by the presence of eminent literary personalities, intellectual discourse, and access to the works of influential philosophers. His father took responsibility of his education, and under his supervision, Charles developed a profound understanding of logic and a blossoming fascination with philosophy.\n\nIn 1885, he began his education at Harvard University, where he befriended future philosopher and psychologist William James, and this marked the start of what was going to be a life-long friendship. During his first year at Harvard, Charles pursued Philosophy, particularly focusing on Kant. He graduated in 1859, and decided to pursue his Master from Harvard. In 1862, he received his Master\u2019s degree. Four years later, he also received a Bachelor\u2019s of Science in Chemistry, summa cum laude.\n\nIn 1859, Peirce was appointed as a scientist by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. He served this position until 1891, and meanwhile, he devoted his free time to pursue his education in logic. During his service at the Survey, Charles was commissioned to Europe thrice, first in 1870, in 1875 and then in 1877. In 1869, he was offered the post of an assistant at the astronomical observatory at Harvard, he worked there till 1872. In 1867, he was made a member of The Academy of Arts and Science, and in 1877, he was also made a member of the National Academy of Sciences. In 1878, he published \u201cPhotometric Researches\u201d, his only book to be published during his lifetime. In 1879, he was appointed as a lecturer of logic at the John Hopkins University, the only academic post he ever held. In 1883, he compiled and edited \u201cStudies in Logic\u201d, through the notes collected by him and his students of\u00a0his lectures.\n\nAfter leaving his position at the Survey, Charles encountered severe financial difficulties, and after purchasing a house in Milford, Pennsylvania, he lived on financial aid and occasionally took up odd and temporary jobs such as translator and scientific consultant. William James remained a constant companion throughout his life, and he helped him through these hard times and also, arranged two paid lectures on Pragmatism for him at the University of Harvard. Regardless of the financial turmoil in his life, Charles devoted his energies to his literary compilations, and his works were published in notable academic and literary journals such as Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, or the American Journal of Mathematics. His best known works are \u201cHow to Make Our Ideas Clear?\u201d, where he established his concept of pragmatic philosophy, and \u201cThe Fixation of Belief\u201d, where he advocated the scientific method, and described it as the only way through which progress towards ultimate knowledge can be made. Peirce is widely considered the founder of the school of Pragmatism, and he is accredited for coining the term, \u201cPragmaticism\u201d.\n\nCharles Sanders Pierce made a great deal of innovative and insightful literary contributions covering a diverse range of topic such as logic, mathematics, geodesy, astronomy, physics, philosophy, and economics among others. Some of his highly acclaimed and widely read works include \u201cWhat Pragmatism Is\u201d, \u201cIssues of Pragmaticism\u201d, \u201cProlegomena To an Apology For Pragmaticism\u201d, \u201cGrounds of Validity of the Laws of Logic: Further Consequences of Four Incapacities\u201d, \u201cThe Monist Metaphysical Series\u201d, \u201cA Neglected Argument for the Reality of God\u201d, \u201cCollected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce\u201d (8 volumes),\u00a0 \u201cReasoning and the Logic of Things: the Cambridge Conferences Lectures of 1898\u201d, \u201cThe Essential Charles Sanders Peirce. Selected Philosophical Writings\u201d \u201cDescription of a Notation for the Logic of Relatives\u201d and \u201cOn the Algebra of Logic\u201d."

    "content": "Cometan is a British autodidactic philosopher who founded Astronism, the branch of philosophy called cosmic philosophy, and organised the Astronic tradition. \n\nCometan is a British autodidact and prodigy of philosophy and theology credited as the founder of the branch of philosophy known as cosmic philosophy which deals with the contemplation of astronomical objects and space exploration. Cometan is also the organiser of the Astronic tradition of religions and philosophies which sits alongside the Abrahamic and Dharmic traditions. This has earned him the label of being the first Astronic philosopher and he is often referred to as the philosopher of the stars. Born Brandon Reece Taylor on 1st July 1998 in the city of Preston in the county of Lancashire, England, Cometan\u2019s upbringing was influenced by his devout Roman Catholic grandmother who intended for Cometan to become a priest. \n\nAfter the separation of his parents when he was four years old,\nCometan became introverted and exhibited difficult behaviour as he felt torn\nbetween his parents and very lonely as a result. Cometan\u2019s parents would send\nhim to many different activities and hobbies, however, their son didn\u2019t\ndedicate himself to any of them and he had few close friends beyond his cousins\nand other family members. However, on the day of his fifteenth birthday,\nCometan\u2019s life would change forever when he first had the thought and ambition\nto become an author. \n\nFrom then on, he dedicated his life to his writing and he\nquickly created the fictional character known as Jesse Millette and developed a\nseries of mystery detective novels. These novels would develop to form an\nentire franchise based on a fictional universe known as the Spacefaring World\nwhich would later come to incorporate various Astronist beliefs into its\nnarratives. Not long after this, Cometan started exploring the subjects of\nphilosophy and theology, both of which he became an autodidact and prodigy of. \n\nFrom the age of seventeen, Cometan began writing the Omnidoxy,\nthe founding treatise of his organised philosophy or religion known as\nAstronism. Upon the completion of its first redaction, the Omnidoxy would\nextend to two million words in length making it the longest religious text, the\nlongest philosophical book, and one of the longest books in history. Cometan\ncompleted the Omnidoxy when he was about twenty-one or twenty-two years old.\nWith his authorship of the Omnidoxy came the immortalisation of Cometan\u2019s\nidentity and status as a philosopher with the founding of his own philosophy\nincluding its own system of ethics, disciplines of study, and nomenclature.\nCometan demonstrated significant determination to succeed and listened only to\nhis own instincts rather than words and opinions of others.\u00a0 \n\nCometan came to believe that philosophy had been undermined in\nmodern society and proposed that its true utility was not being realised. The\nphilosopher advocated for the reascension of philosophy involving its return as\na much needed pillar of society inspired by its central role in Ancient Greek\nsociety. With the introduction of reascensionism as part of Astronist belief,\nCometan sought to redefine the role and identity of philosophy and philosophers\nin the current and future society. From a young age, Cometan contributed\nimmensely to the terminology of philosophy and religion and he also made\nsignificant developments to metaphilosophy. Cometan is credited with coining\nthe word philosophership along with thousands of other new terms. \n\nAnother important element to the philosophership of Cometan is\nhis creation of a new branch of philosophy known as cosmic philosophy. Distinct\nfrom the philosophy of cosmology which deals with various theories regarding\nthe creation of the universe, cosmic philosophy deals with contemplations\nregarding astronomical objects and events as well as space exploration. It\nexplores questions regarding the ethics, viability and potential methodologies\nof space exploration among other topics from a philosophical point of view.\n\nCometan has already made significant contributions to the world\nof philosophy. He considers himself an outsider of the establishment keen to\nforge his own path involving a unique synthesis of philosophy and religion.\nCometan has become a celebrity philosopher branding himself as a new young face\nin the discipline as he continues to redefine what a philosopher is in the 21st\ncentury and beyond. \n\nCometanic Quotes\n\n\u201cMy faith is strongest when the night sky is clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorld, do what you wish with my philosophy, but remember, it\nwill always be mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo what is unexpected of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Omnidoxy will reveal my philosophy to the world, and it\nshall encapsulate its ideas forevermore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour faith should prove itself to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have fallen in love with The Cosmos and all of the possibilities it does hold.\u201d"

    "name": "Confucius",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/confucius.jpg",
    "content": "Confucius is the Latin name of the Great Master K\u2019ung Chung-ni, an acclaimed and influential Chinese scholar and philosopher, who is recognized\u00a0for laying the foundations of the very prevalent Chinese discipline of philosophy that is referred to as the \u2018Ju\u2019 or more commonly known as Confucianism.\n\nConfucius was born as K\u2019ung Ch\u2019iu, in 551 BCE to the royal family of Shang. His family lived in Lu, a small town in Shantung, north-eastern China. Confucius is said have born from his father\u2019s second marriage, his mother hailed from the Yen clan. His childhood years were marked with destitution as his family\u2019s fortunes had declined considerably. Although Confucius belonged to the Shih, the name given to aristocracy, he had to acquire various different skills in order to survive rather than serve at the Royal court like other members of the shih. He is said to have studied under the tutelage of renowned Daoist Master, Lao Dan, and in addition to that, he also studied music and lute with Chang Hong and Xiang respectively.\n\nConfucius began his professional career as a keeper of the Lu granary, and later, he was appointed as the supervisor of the fields. He had also worked as a book-keeper, clerk, cowherd and shepherd. However, all these occupations were peasantry in comparison with the offices held by other shih members. Confucius lost his mother at the age of 23, and this tragedy broke him down. He spent the next three years in mourning.\n\nConfucius began teaching when he turned 32, he taught the ancient rituals to a minister\u2019s son. Soon, he decided to leave Lu, and travelled to Lo-Yang, which was the imperial capital. In Lo-Yang, he studied the traditions and customs of the Chou Empire. Many historians have reported that Confucius was extremely close to the Prince of Lu, and upon reaching the age of 34, he accompanied the Prince on his voyage to a neighboring state because of the threat posed to the Prince\u2019s life by his rivals.\n\nUpon returning to Lu, Confucius resumed his teachings, and is said to have gathered an extremely large number of disciplines, approximately three thousand people. Everyone was welcome to attend his lectures and sermons. He believed that the teacher must not preach to his students, rather, he must strive to motivate them, and to encourage them to increase their knowledge and excel in their abilities. Confucius\u2019 teachings were based on the six arts: calligraphy, music, chariot-driving, archery, computation and ritual. And above all these things, he gave utmost importance to inculcating in his students, a profound sense of integrity. His teachings strongly advocated the traditional values of propriety, ritual and benevolence. He put great emphasis on morality, government, and encouraged his students to educate themselves in language, speech and arts.\n\nConfucius was appointed the Minister of Justice in Lu upon reaching the age of 51. His political status was eventually enhanced to the Prime Minister of Lu. The Prince of Lu continued to maintain his close ties with Confucius, and often consulted him on trivial matters. Under Confucius\u2019s council, the state of Lu rose among the most prosperous and influential states of the dynasty. However, upon getting embroiled in certain misunderstanding with the Prince, Confucius decided to resign from his position and leave Lu.\n\nFollowing his departure from Lu, Confucius travelled around for the next twelve years, searching for an opportunity to implement his political principals, however, no such opportunity presented itself, and at the age of 68, Confucius return to his native Lu. He remained there until his death, and refused all offers for a government position. Confucius died in 479 BC, at the age of 72.\n\nConfucius made several literary contributions, which are hugely acclaimed and widely read in China, as well as, various other parts of the world. He has said to have compiled and edited a great number of iconic Chinese traditional classics. He is also credited with compiling a rearrangement of the \u2018Book of Odes\u2019 and the \u2018Book of Documents\u2019. He wrote historical biographies on the 12 dukes of Lu, entitled \u2018Spring and the Autumn Annals\u2019, a book that contains Confucius\u2019 political and philosophical ideologies."

    "content": "Daniel Dennett is a remarkable American author and philosopher, who is credited for making significant innovative contribution to the philosophy of science, mind and biology.\n\nDaniel was born on\u00a0March 28, 1942, to parents Daniel Clement Dennett Jr. and Ruth Marjorie in Boston, Massachusetts. His early years were spent in Lebanon, where his father worked as a secret counter intelligence agent with the Office of Strategic Services. His father passed away when he was 5 years old, and Daniel returned to Boston along with his mother. He became attracted to the subject matter of philosophy at the tender age of 11, during a summer camp, and ever since, he was determined to carve out a career for himself in philosophy. Daniel attended the Phillips Exeter Academy for a while, and later, enrolled himself at the Wesleyan University for a year. He received his degree in Bachelors of Arts in philosophy from the Harvard University in 1963. Upon his graduation, Daniel was admitted to the University of Oxford, where he benefited from the tutelage of Gilbert Ryle. He was also made a member of Hertford College. In 1965, Dennett received his Ph.D. in Philosophy.\n\nDennett began his professional career in 1965, by accepting a teaching position at UC Irvine, he served here for the next six years. In 1971, he was offered a professorship at the University of Tufts, which he continues to serve till date. In addition to that, he is also the co-director of the Centre of Cognitive Studies, along with the Austin B. Fletcher Professor of Philosophy. Along with his teaching profession, Daniel is credited for making several notable literary contributions which have played a significant role in the evolution of modern philosophy. He published his first book in 1978, entitled \u201cBrainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology\u201d, the book provides an insight on his theories of artificial intelligence and consciousness. In 1981, he published another remarkable and widely applauded work, entitled \u2018The Mind\u2019s I: Fantasies and Reflection on Self and Soul\u2019. He followed that up with a book that dealt with free will and determinism, entitled \u2018Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting\u2019.\n\nDennett introduced the term of \u2018Intentional stance\u2019 which he describes as the level of abstraction and mental properties we see while examining the behavior of our objects of observation. He proposed that there are three levels of abstraction: The physical stance, the design stance and the intentional stance. During the 1990\u2019s, Dennett became increasingly fascinated by the contrasting brain of humans and animals, and he sought to make comparisons. He also became occupied by conducting an analysis on the concept of free will, and its relationship with naturalistic perspective of the world. In 1991, he composed another innovative work entitled \u2018Consciousness Explained\u2019, where he provided a comprehensive analysis on the physical and cognitive makeup of the human brain, and how the physical and cognitive process work to arouse the consciousness. The book also shed light on the multiple drafts model of consciousness.\n\nIn 1995, Daniel Dennett presented the world with his greatest single work, entitled \u201cDarwin\u2019s Dangerous Idea\u201d, which proposes natural selection as a mechanical and algorithmic process based on the Darwinism theory of evolution. The book was globally applauded and widely discussed, it was nominated for the 1995 National Book Award in non-fiction, and it rose up to become a finalist. It was also awarded the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for general non-fiction.\n\nIn 2003, Dennett published yet another monumental work, titled \u201cFreedom Evolves\u201d, which deals with the concept of free will and moral responsibilities in relation with consciousness and personhood. Several other phenomenal contributions by Dennett include \u2018Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon\u2019, \u2018Sweet Dreams: Philosophical Obstacles to a Science of Consciousness\u2019, \u2018Neuroscience and Philosophy: Brain, Mind, and Language\u2019, Science and Religion\u2019, \u2018Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking\u2019 and \u2018Inside Jokes: Using Humor to Reverse-Engineer the Mind\u2019.\n\nDaniel Dennett has been presented with several awards and honors as a tribute to his groundbreaking research and academic contributions. He has been awarded a Fulbright Fellowship, a Fellowship at the Centre for Advanced Studies in Behavioral Science, two Guggenheim Fellowships and a Fellowship of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. In 2004, the American Humanist Association presented him with the title of the Humanist of the Year.

    "name": "David Hume",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/david-hume.jpg",
    "content": "David Hume was a remarkable historian, philosopher, economist and writer, renowned for his skepticism and philosophical empiricism. He is ranked among the pioneering contributors to Western Philosophy and the Scottish Enlightenment.\n\nDavid Hume, was born on\u00a0May 7, 1711, to parents Joseph Home and Katherine Falconer in Edinburgh. He hailed from a prosperous family, his father was a solicitor. At the mere age of 12, Hume began attending the University of Edinburgh, where he initially pursued an education in law but later, his interest were piqued by philosophy. Hume did not believe his professors could teach him anything, and thus, he did not regard them with the respect required by their station. From an early age, David took his education in his own hands and began to guide himself through philosophical discoveries. He became a recluse, and devoted ten years of life to reading and writing. However, this solitude and intense concentration had its toll on him and, he suffered a nervous breakdown, following which, he continued his learning with a more active lifestyle.\n\nHume took up a job in a merchant\u2019s office in Bristol, but after a few months, in 1734, he decided to move to La Fleche in Anjou, France. In La Fleche, he devoted the next four years of his life composing one of his remarkable discourses, \u201cA Treatise of Human Nature\u201d, he managed to finish it at the age of 26. In the Treatise, Hume, based on his ideologies, constructed the entire innate structure of human beings, which he referred to as the \u201cscience of man\u201d, and provided an in depth analysis of human nature. Based on his evaluations, Hume concluded that human behavior is governed by desire rather than reasoning and logic. His work was appreciated by many, however, it also garnered some bitter criticism. His religious disobedience embroiled him in regular arguments with the Jesuits of the College of La Fleche. In 1744, he published \u2018Essays Moral and Political\u2019.\n\nHume applied for the position of Chair of Pneumatics and Moral Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, however, due to his infamous religious intolerance and his reputation as an atheist, he was passed over for William Cleghorn. In 1745, Hume served for some time, as a private tutor to the Marquis of Annandale, who was popularly known as the \u201clunatic\u201d. A year later, he began working on his innovative compilation, entitled \u201cThe History of England\u201d. It took him 15 years to compile this work, the book provided events dating from the invasion of Julius Caesar till the 1688 revolution and it was published in six volumes between 1754 and 1762. The book was a remarkable literary success, and it quickly became the largest selling book of the 18th century. It garnered him immense fame as a writer and historian.\n\nIn 1746, Hume was appointed as Secretary to Lieutenant-General St Clair, he served this post for the next three years. During this time, he wrote \u2018Philosophical Essays Associated with Human Understanding\u2019, which was later published as \u2018An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding\u2019. This publication was widely applauded and began garnering him fame as a gifted philosopher. However, Hume became embroiled in several controversies directed against his religious beliefs, and he was in fact, officially charged with heresy. Hume was defended by his friend, who was a young lawyer yet, he managed to build a strong case in Hume\u2019s defense arguing that being an atheist, Hume fell outside the sphere of the Church\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nDespite several attempts, Hume was unable to attain the post of Chair of Philosophy at the University of Glasgow. In 1752, he returned to his native Edinburg and, began composing his autobiography, entitled \u201cMy Own Life\u201d. In 1763, he was appointed as a secretary to Lord Hertford in Paris, he served him for the next two years. In 1767, he accepted the position of Under Secretary of State for the Northern Department, however, he served this station for only a year. In 1768, he decided to move back to his birth place, Edinburgh, where he remained till his death. He passed away on\u00a0August 25, 1776, after a prolonged suffrage with liver cancer.\n\nHume\u2019s literary contributions have played a significant role in the evolution of empiricism and Philosophy. Some of his highly acclaimed and widely discussed works include, \u2018A Treatise of Human Nature\u2019, \u2018Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary\u2019, \u2018An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\u2019, \u2018An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals\u2019, \u2018The Natural History of Religion\u2019 and \u2018Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion\u2019 among others."

    "name": "Democritus",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/democritus.jpg",
    "content": "Democritus was a remarkable Greek Philosopher best known for his contributions to modern science that exceed those of any other pre-Socratic philosopher. He is famously known as the \u201claughing philosopher\u201d due to his habit of mocking people on their mistakes. Democritus\u2019 works has not survived the years unfortunately, however, what is found about his life and teachings is found by the writings done on him Aristotle, Theophrastus and Diogenes among others.\n\nDemocritus is said to have born around 460 BCE in Adbera, Thrace. He belonged to a wealthy family, his father possessed such riches that he met Xerxes I of Persia during his march to Adbera. Upon his father\u2019s death, Democritus spent his inheritance on travelling, he journeyed to Babylon, Egypt and even India, in pursuit of knowledge, experience and wisdom. Democritus did not have a care for his wealth, and he did not manage his finances with care, everything he had was put to serve his investigations, explorations and education. During his travels he encountered some of the most eminent personalities of his time, such as Anaxagoras, Hippocrates, Socrates and Plato.\n\nDemocritus studied under the guidance of Leucippus, and further evolved his atomist theory by adding his own theories to develop it more extensively. Democritus proposed that everything in the world is made up of a combination of bits of immutable stuff which he termed as atoms. Atoms, he said, are indivisible, and continue to join and produce more atoms, which constitute all materials of life. He believed that atoms not only constituted material objects, but also made an impact on our senses, sights, thoughts and soul. He proposed that atoms, the hard bits of reality, are actually the reasoning power controlling our senses, and we experience vision due to the movement of atoms through the space. Furthermore, he also believed that the psychical sense of touch was also influenced by the movement of atoms, while the sense of taste he explained as the tearing of taste buds by \u2018jagged\u2019 atoms.\n\nDemocritus believed that truth and falsehood are both subjected to the interpretation of the observer, he proposed that truth resides at the \u2018bottom\u2019 and can be explored by logical interpretation of sensory data. He formulated a contrast between two types of understandings, which he termed as \u2018gnesie\u2019 or genuine and \u2018skotie\u2019 or bastard. The genuine or authentic knowledge can be gained through logical and rationality while the bastard understanding is fallacious and biased, solely based on perceptions. He describes the process of perception as follows: a human being is stimulated by the movement of the atoms, he/she draws conclusions based on observation and understanding and forms a realization of the cause of the stimulation. This process is an evident example of Democritus\u2019 reliance on scientific methods.\n\nDemocritus was extremely outspoken, and thus he was named as \u201cthe mocker\u201d, for his open contempt of those who engaged in follies. His ethical teachings revolved around social responsibility and personal integrity, he did not believe in the existence of any supernatural being. Democritus gave strong emphasis on virtue and believed that being good eliminated fear. He also believed that the goodness in people is not a biological feature, but\u00a0a psychological trait that develops with practices, teachings and discipline."

    "name": "Diogenes",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/diogenes.jpg",
    "content": "Diogenes, widely remembered as \u2018Diogenes of Sinope\u2019, was an exemplary and esteemed Greek philosopher who is ranked among the founders of the Cynic philosophy. He was the only student of Antisthenes, and a principal upholder of his teacher\u2019s asceticism and ethical ideologies. Diogenes is applauded for his philosophical teachings infused with an apt and unique sense of humor that isn\u2019t found in the works of other philosophers throughout history. He was among the very few people to have publicly insulted Alexander the Great and not been subjected to his wrath. Diogenes\u2019 life was riddled with various controversies, he was very opinionated and spent his entire life engaging in efforts to disparage and deprecate social values, and to unmask the institutions of a corrupt society. Diogenes believed that virtue can only be exhibited through actions rather than words.\n\nDiogenes was born in 412 BC, in Sinope, a Greek colony located on the south coast of the Black Sea. His father, Hicesias, was a banker, and he encouraged Diogenes to help him by joining the banking business. Diogenes was exiled from Sinope on account of a scandal that accused him and his father of defacing the currency. Diogenes then decided to settle in Athens, fueled with the ambition of ridiculing societal values and customs. In Athens, he\u00a0set to work in disrupting the \u201ccoinage\u201d of established customs, and he believed that people do not speculate on the real nature of evil but rather, they are content with relying on pre-established customary interpretations. Diogenes became influenced by the ascetic teachings of Antisthenes, and despite Antisthenes\u2019 refusal to take up students, Diogenes\u2019 persistence paid off and he became Antisthenes\u2019 pupil. Diogenes developed his ideologies from Antisthenes\u2019 teachings, and later surpassed even his teacher through evolving his theories to an extreme.\n\nDiogenes practiced everything he preached, and he preached an ideology of\u00a0openly rebelling against conventions and dismissed the artificial values constructed by a corrupt society. Thus, Diogenes resided in an urn shaped tub that was the property of the temple of Cybele. This lifestyle that was much similar with that of a mouse, according to Diogenes, taught him adaptability. On one occasion, Diogenes is said to have smashed his only wooden bowl upon watching peasant boy drink water from his palms. Several other incidents of his unconventional behavior are found in his biographies, such as; Diogenes would always eat in the marketplace even though the Athenian customs advised against it. He would often be seen carrying a lamp in broad daylight, and upon inquiring, he would say offhandedly, \u201cI am just looking for an honest man\u201d. Diogenes\u2019 quest for an honest and trustworthy human being was only met with selfish and wicked people.\n\nWhen Plato gained immense appraise for revising Socrates\u2019 definition of a man as \u201cfeatherless bipeds\u201d, Diogenes brought a chicken into the Academy of Plato and said, \u201cBehold! I\u2019ve brought you a man\u201d. After this outrageous act, Plato was forced to add \u201cwith broad flat nails\u201d to the definition. Due to his outrage against conventionalism and outspoken criticisms, and Plato publicly referred to Diogenes as \u201ca Socrates gone mad\u201d. Diogenes believed that human life had to be based on reason to differ from the life of a kept animal that constantly needs to led and leashed. He considered reason to be a man\u2019s best companion, and preached that reason and logic must be a guiding principle when undertaking decisions.\n\nIt is also reported that during a voyage to Aegina, Diogenes was grabbed by pirates and sold off as a slave in Crete to a Corinthian man, Xeniades. Following that, Diogenes lived in Corinth for the rest of his life as the tutor of Xeniades\u2019 two sons. He dedicated his life to preaching the principals of virtuous self-control. He is also reported to have lectured a huge crowd at the Isthmian Games.\n\nIn Corinth, Diogenes also encountered Alexander the Great, and according to the reports of various historians, they exchanged a few words. Their encounter is reported in several biographies as a different story. One story describes Diogenes laying in the sunlight, and Alexander, upon meeting the esteemed philosopher asked him if he wanted any particular favor, to which Diogenes replied \u201cYes, stand out of my sunlight\u201d. Alexander, instead of being slighted by the obvious disrespect for his station, is reported to have said, \u201cIf I were not Alexander, then I should wish to be Diogenes\u201d. However, another account of their meeting relays the events differently, Alexander is said to have seen Diogenes examining a pile of human bones with utmost concentration, and upon Alexander\u2019s inquiring, he said, \u201cI am searching for the bones of your father but cannot distinguish them from those of a slave\u201d.\n\nDiogenes died in 323 BC. The citizens of Corinth erected a pillar where a dog made of Parian marble was rested, as a tribute to his memory."

    "name": "Edmund Burke",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/edmund-burke.jpg",
    "content": "Edmund Burke was a renowned British politician, a prominent member of the Whig party, an influential political orator, theorist, author and philosopher, who is widely considered as the founder of modern conservatism philosophy and the principal advocate of classical liberalism. His political acumen was applauded by both the conservatives and liberals, and he is ranked among the most influential politicians in the 19th century. Burke is acclaimed for being the first politician to address the grievances of the American colonies under British rule through his writings and speeches, and he served the British government on several prestigious administrative positions.\n\nEdmund was born into an affluent family in Dublin, Ireland on\u00a0January 12, 1729. His father, Richard Burke, was a prosperous lawyer and, under his father\u2019s guidance, Edmund grew up as a follower of the Anglican faith. Burke received his basic education at Quaker School, in Ballitore, and in 1744, he was accepted at the Trinity College in Dublin. In 1747, he established a debating club which became popular as the \u2018Edmund Burke\u2019s Club\u2019, and years later in 1770, this club was merged\u00a0with the Historical Club and made the College Historical Society, which remains to this day, a prominent and influential undergraduate society. In 1748, Edmund received his bachelor\u2019s degree, and upon his father\u2019s insistence, he moved to London in 1750, to pursue an education in Law. In London, he was accepted at the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple, however, Burke was not keen on studying law, and he gave up his legal education to travel around Europe. Burke\u2019s intentions were to pursue a career in writing instead of law.\n\nIn 1756, Burke published his first discourse, entitled \u2018A Vindication of Natural Society: A View of the Miseries and Evils Arising to Mankind\u2019, which was inspired by the works of Lord Bolingbroke on argumentations against religion and its impact on social and civil institutions. Burke began garnering overwhelming applause and positive reviews for his book, his fame as a gifted writer began to spread. In 1757, he released his study of aesthetics, entitled \u2018A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful\u2019.\n\nIn 1757, Burke was commissioned by Robert Dodsley to compose a \u201chistory of England from the time of Julius Caesar to the end of the reign of Queen Anne\u201d, Burke produced a composition that covered the history till 1216, but he was unable to finish it. The book was published in 1812.\n\nBurke\u2019s entry to the British Parliament was triggered by his encounter with William Gerard in the 1750s, who upon securing the position of Chief Secretary of Ireland, appointed Burke as his private secretary. Burke served him for the next three years, and in 1765, he accepted the position of a private secretary to liberal Whig statesman, the Marquess of Rockingham. The same year, he entered the British Parliament by becoming a member of the House of Commons for Wendover, Burke\u2019s first speech in the parliament made an extremely positive impression. In 1769, he published his much discussed pamphlet, entitled \u201cObservations on a Late State of the Nation\u201d.\n\nBurke\u2019s rise in parliament is marked by his influential debates on the constitutional limits to the supreme authority of the Monarch, and his questioning against the irrevocable monarchical abuses of authority. He encouraged all political parties to unite and raise their voice against the irrefutable royal power in Britain. In 1770, he published \u201cThoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents\u201d. \u00a0Burke was an active participant in the debates held in the Parliament, and in 1770, he made one of his many iconic speeches that advocated a free market in corn during a debate held to discuss the merits of a prohibition on the export of grains. Due to Burke\u2019s tireless efforts, the \u2018Repeal of Certain Law Act\u2019 was passed in 1772, that put away with all the existing laws directed against forestallers and dealers in corn. Burke was also a significant commentator against the partition of Poland, his writings opposing the partition are included in the Annual Register. In 1774, Burke was elected as the member of Bristol, and in 1778, he was among the principal opponents to the restrictions imposed on Irish trade, he also took part in a Parliamentary motion that advocated a revision of the restrictions. In 1780, Burke lost his seat in the Parliament due to his constant support of unconventional laws such as free trade.\n\nEdmund Burke had a profound sympathy for the grievances of the deprived and impoverished American colonies under the rule of King George III. On March 22, 1775, he addressed the plight of the Americans in a speech inside the House of Commons, he warned England of the dire retributions from America if the situation was not improved.\n\nThe Gordon Riots of 1780 brought Burke in the centre of unrest and turmoil, as the rioters began targeting him and his house had to be placed under military protection. In 1782, Edmund was appointed as the Paymaster of the Forces and a Privy Councillor, however, he was not given a cabinet seat. He abolished 134 offices in the royal household and civil administration, and passed two acts, \u201cThe Paymaster General Act 1782\u201d and \u201cThe Civil List and Secret Service Money Act 1782\u201d.\n\nBurke is the principal accuser in the impeachment of Warren Hastings, upon conducting an in depth analysis of the East India Company\u2019s activities in India, Burke made his memorable speech on \u2018The Nabob of Arcot\u2019s Debts\u2019, where he officially accused Hastings for the damage done by EIC in India. In 1786, he presented his \u201cArticle of Charge of High Crimes and Misdemeanours\u201d against Hastings which led to the trial in 1788.\n\nBurke was extremely critical of the French revolution, and hostile towards the English approval of the events taking place in France. He discussed the demerits of the French Revolutions in his book \u2018Reflections on the Revolution in France\u2019, published in 1790. Burke\u2019s writing has aided governments in making counter-revolutionary strategies in France and Germany.\n\nBurke died on July 9, 1797, after a prolonged suffering with a stomach ailment."

    "name": "Edmund Husserl",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/edmund-husserl.jpg",
    "content": "Edmund Husserl, the pioneer of the discipline of phenomenology, and one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century credited for his significant contributions to the fields of philosophy, linguistics, sociology and cognitive psychology, was born as Edmund Gustav Albrecht Husserl on\u00a0April 8, 1859, in Prossnitz, Moravia. Edmund hailed from a traditional Jewish family, and throughout his childhood, his family was constantly on the move. At the age of 10, he began his German classical education at the Realgymnasium in Vienna. Later, he was transferred to the Staatsgymnasium in Olmutz, for his secondary education. Edmund enrolled in university at Leipzig, where he pursued an education in Mathematics, physics and philosophy, and also took several courses in astronomy and optics. He received his Ph.D. in 1883, after conducting a doctoral dissertation on the calculus of variations.\n\nHusserl began his professional career in Berlin by accepting a teaching post, however his engrossment with the teachings of Franz Brentano forced him to move back to Vienna in 1884. Franz Brentano\u2019s lectures, particularly his concept of intent, had a profound influence on Husserl, and they inspired him to educate himself in the disciplines of psychology and philosophy. In 1886, Edmund moved to Halle, and devoted the next year educating himself in psychology. He composed his Habilitationsschrift, entitled \u2018The Philosophy of Arithmetic\u2019. During this period, he converted to Christianity and got married to Malvine Charlotte Steinschneider, the couple had three children. Husserl was appointed as the Privatdozent of Halle, and he used his free time to compose some of his major works on phenomenology, including \u2018Logische Untersuchungen\u2019 (Logical investigations), that provides an introduction into the subject matter of phenomenology.\n\nIn 1901, Husserl began his 16 year long tenure at the University of Gottingen, and during this period, he formulated his various theories on phenomenology, establishing it as a specific discipline devoted to describe events and things without employing metaphysical and theoretical speculations. His courses began attracting countless students. In 1913, he published his widely lauded and innovative discourse, entitled \u2018Ideas: A General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology\u2019, an introduction to his concept of phenomenological reduction that provides perceptive tools designed for the contemplation and reflection of objects while conducting observations. Husserl proposed that the method of phenomenological reduction aids in removing all biases of real existence, and facilitates the researcher in concentrating on the \u201cbracketing of existence\u201d. Husserl conducted various studies to establish an understanding of the mental structures that are responsible for the cognitive abilities of perceptions and thoughts, and he concluded his research upon discovering that an object of contemplation is necessary for consciousness.\n\nThe advent of the WWI caused various disruptions in Husserl\u2019s academic career as he began losing most of his students to the war, and tragedy struck his life in 1916, when his son was killed while fighting at the warfront. Edmund was devastated, and he spent a year in mourning, ignoring his professional career completely. However, in the fall of 1916, he was appointed as a Professor at Freiburg, in Beisgau. He authored\u00a0several highly acclaimed works during this period, some of which were published after his death, including \u2018Cartesian Meditations\u2019 where Husserl explains the influence of individual consciousness over philosophy, history and society.\n\nEdmund Husserl served as a professor at Freiburg until his death resulting from pleurisy in 1938. He has made several remarkably innovative literary contributions to the academic world, his most popular publications include, \u2018Phenomenology of Inner Time-Consciousness\u2019, \u2018Formal and Transcendental Logic\u2019 and \u2018Experience and Judgment\u2019."

    "name": "Emile Durkheim",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/emile-durkheim.jpg",
    "content": "Emile Durkheim, a pioneer architect of the discipline of social science and widely referred to as the father of modern sociology, was born on\u00a0April 15, 1858, in Epinel, Lorraine. Emile belonged to an affluent family of Rabbis, his father was the Rabbi of Epinal, along with the Chief Rabbia of Vosges and Haute-Marne. Emile was expected to continue with the traditional family profession, however, he was adamant against becoming a Rabbi despite being enrolled in a rabbinical school for his early education. Durkheim was an exceptionally bright student, he was accepted at the College d\u2019Epinal, where he was granted his bachelor\u2019s degree in Letters and Sciences, and applauded for showing a remarkable performance in the Concours General.\n\nDurkheim wished to train as a teacher, and therefore, he moved to Paris and began preparing himself for attaining admission at the renowned Ecole Normale Superieure. Despite being allotted a pension for non-resident students, his financial means had become very scarce due to his father\u2019s illness. Emile, who had spent his entire life in the country, was living alone in Paris all by himself, and the task ahead of him seemed tough as his analytical and scientific mind found it difficult to conduct the study of Latin and rhetoric required on the admission criteria for the Ecole Normale Superieure. He failed his first two attempts, however he managed to get an acceptance in 1879.\n\nDurkheim\u2019s stay at the Ecole marks the most creative and constructive period of his life, he studied along with brilliant philosophers, linguists, psychologists, historians, geographers and socialists including Henri Bergson, Bustave Belot, Edmond Goblot, Pierre Janet, Ferdinand Brunot, Camille Jullian, Lucien Gallois, and Emile\u2019s lifelong friend Jean Jaures. In Paris, away from the influence of close-knit, traditional Jewish community, Emile began to break away from Judaism. He was increasingly self-critical about his abilities, and constantly wrestled with the apprehension of failure. However, despite his fears, he was an active contributor in political and philosophical debates that were a common feature at the Ecole. Durkheim was interested in scientific exploration and analysis, and thus, he was unsatisfied by the Ecole\u2019s preference over the literary rather than scientific theorization. However, Emile found his academic solace in the lectures of philosophers Emile Boutroux and Charles Renouvier, and historian Numas-Denis Fustel de Coulanges. In 1882, Durkheim cleared his aggregation, an arduous examination required for teaching at state secondary schools, and he began his career as a philosophy teacher.\n\nIn 1882, The Faculty of Letters at Bordeaux began making progressive changes in the education system of France, it established France\u2019s first course in pedagogy and in 1884, the government backed up this venture in order to introduce an advanced learning system of secular and republican education. Durkheim\u2019s composition of essays and articles on social science and German philosophy began garnering him fame and acknowledgement for his philosophical acumen. His writings caught the eye of the Director of Higher Education in France, Louis Liard, who became captivated and influenced by Emile\u2019s propositions for the remodeling of French morality on the basis of secular and scientific learning. In 1887, Durkheim was appointed as the \u201cCharg\u00e9d\u2019un Cours de Science Sociale et de P\u00e9dagogie\u201d at Bordeaux. Emile is credited for the addition of sociology in the official curriculum of the French education system.\n\nFrom 1887-1902, Durkheim devoted his time to educate the masses in the various benefits of social science, and placed emphasis on the how the discipline of sociology provides understanding and insight into the trivial matters of human behavior dealt in psychology, philosophy, history and law. He established the first European department of sociology in Bordeaux. In 1892, Emile published his doctoral dissertation, \u2018The Division of Labor in Society\u2019, which discussed human nature and its development, and advocated moral and economic regulation for upholding peace and stability in society. He conducted lectures on theory, practice of education and history, and in addition to that, he conducted a public lecture course on social science every Saturday, where he discussed widely encountered social phenomenon such as social solidarity, family, incest, totemism, crime, religion, law, socialism and suicide. In 1895, he published one of his highly innovative works, \u2018The Rules of the Sociological Method\u2019, where he provided specific scientific guidelines to be employed while conducting sociological research.\n\nIn 1897, he published his much discussed work, \u2018Suicide\u2019 which provided the theoretical explorations of a case study that Emile had conducted in order to investigate the varying suicide rates among Catholics and Protestants. Emile is credited for the introduction of quantitative methods while conducting research in criminology, and he placed strong emphasis on employing primary research methods such as surveys, data collection and evaluation.\n\nIn 1898, Durkheim established the \u2018Annee Sociologique\u2019, the first journal in France devoted to the discussion of social sciences. Durkheim formed an impressive setup of social and philosophical contributions to the journal that was supported by a group of innovative and prominent philosophers. Soon, the Annee acquired the status of being France\u2019s prominent source of sociological developments, as well as an annual survey of sociological literature and original sociological monographs.\n\nIn 1902, Emile\u2019s long standing dream of attaining an influential academic post in Paris came true upon his appointment as the Chair of education at the Sorbonne. He was appointed to the Council of the University and also sat on the advisory committee of the Ministry of Education. In 1912, he published \u2018The Elementary Form of the Religious Life\u2019, where he provides an analysis of religion as a social phenomenon, and constructs linkages between the emotional security of communal lifestyles and religious developments. With advent of the WWI, Emile became preoccupied with supporting the national cause, establishing societies for composing war documentation to be sent to neutral countries to check anti-German sentiments.\n\nIn 1915, tragedy struck Emile Durkheim\u2019s life when his beloved son Andre was killed while fighting at the Balkan front. This catastrophe left him devastated and he suffered a stroke in Paris. Emile Durkheim passed away on November 15, 1917."

    "name": "Emma Goldman",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/emma-goldman.jpg",
    "content": "Renowned political activist and anarchist, Emma Goldman, who rebelled against a chauvinistic society by advocating on issues such as peace, free love and birth control during a period when women were considered as inferior beings, was born on June 27, 1869 in Kaunas, located in the Russian province of Lithuania. Emma entered the world during times of serious political turmoil, the Bolshevik Revolution was beginning to spark and discontentment with the Czar\u2019s autocratic regime was at its peak. Emma belonged to a Jewish family, and was the third child of Abraham and Taube Goldman. She was a rebellious child, which was unsettling as she lived in a society that placed men as more superior to women. During her youth, she was often forced into sparring with her father, who was a hot-headed and intolerant man, and openly expressed his discontentment with Emma\u2019s birth instead of a son he had always desired so deeply. Being a traditional Jewish father, he wanted her to settle down with domesticities and planned to arrange a marriage for 15 year old Emma. Emma, however, had other plans, she wanted, more than anything, to avail the chance of pursuing an education and carving out a career for herself. Goldman spent most of her childhood and youth in Kaunas, Konigsberg and St. Petersburg.\n\nIn 1885, she, along with her sister, migrated to the United States to join their other sister living in Rochester, New York. The apartment they lived in was crowded as her two sisters and brother in law, all had to cramp into the tiny place. Soon, Emma secured employment at a coat factory, where she was paid a salary of $2.50 for sewing for ten and a half hours a day. Her indigent and impoverished working and living conditions led her to find refuge in anarchism, and she joined the labor movement which was yet undergoing a budding phase. Goldman became a member of several radical societies, and began actively participating in agitations and protests, advocating for improvement in working conditions, particularly the demand of an eight-hour workday.\n\nGoldman\u2019s opposition of labour injustice was intensified by the tragic Haymarket Square incident that took place in Chicago in 1886. Emma was shocked at this atrocity, and she committed to the cause of the laborers with renewed zeal and passion. She began frequenting the anarchist circles, participating in meetings, and devouring the militant anarchist magazine, Die Freiheit (Freedom). Her intense commitment to the cause and her regular involvement in agitations led her to move to New York in 1889, as a 20 year old Emma wanted to be at the heart of the revolutionary anarchist activity.\n\nSoon, Emma Goldman\u2019s fame as an anarchist grew and she was given the title of Red Emma. She devoted her time to writing, traveling and lecturing in order to spread the message of anarchism and to garner support for the labor movement. Emma\u2019s movements were constantly traced by trailing detectives and in 1893, she was jailed for a brief period under the accusation of urging and provoking workers to create uproar.\u00a0 Upon her release from jail, Emma decided to move to Vienna and begin training as a midwife and nurse. However, she shortly returned to New York where resumed her radical activities and earned the status of a prominent anarchist lecturer. Her lectures were attended by affluent citizens as well as the destitute members of the working class. In 1901, she became embroiled in a raging scandal when she was apprehended for provoking the assassin of President William Mckinley, just because the assassin had been present during one of her lectures. No official charges were filed against her, however, the newspapers created a massive wave of controversial propaganda against her all over the US, branding her as a wicked traitor.\n\nIn 1906, Emma founded her own magazine \u2018Mother Earth\u2019 which became the voice of anarchism and feminism. It quickly attained the status of a prominent rostrum for the growth and spread of anarchist and feminist ideologies. She continued to publish the magazine till 1917, while making extensive travels to lecture and educate people on the principals of anarchism. However, the liberal freedom that political activists enjoyed in the US prior to the World War I began to get constricting and limiting when USA joined the war effort. The government became extremely critical and fearful of the propaganda generated by pacifists, anarchists, leftists, and especially, foreigners. In 1917 and 1918, the government began imposing strict legislations to limit the opposition of war and the liberal activities of extremists and radicials, such as the Selective Service Act, the Espionage Act and the Sedition Act. Regardless of the pressure exerted by the government, Emma went about her radical activities as usual, and moreover, she, along with Leonard Abott, Berkman and Eleanor Fitzgerald, organized the No-Conscription League with the motive of opposing \u201call wars by capitalist governments\u201d. She used her magazine Mother Earth to publish anti-war content and to incite the masses to refuse to conscript. In light of these anti-war activities, Goldman, along with Berkman, was arrested on charges of being an accomplice in preventing draft registrations. They were fined $10,000 and sentenced to two years in prison. In 1919, she was deported to Russia when USA was overtaken by a violent wave of the red scare which led to the arrest and deportation of countless leftisits, anarchists and radical political activists.\n\nEmma tried to carve out a fulfilling life for herself in Russia, however, she soon became disillusioned with the oppressive and restraining tactics of the new government. She has described her disappointment with the Bolshevik government in her book, \u2018My Disillusionment in Russia\u2019, which she published in 1923. In 1921, Emma left Russia for Germany, where she resumed giving lectures. In 1924, she relocated again, this time to England, but her heart was in the United States and she desperately wished to return there. She married James Colton, who was British and provided her with British citizenship. She harbored dreams of acquiring a British passport which would take her to Canada and then, assist her gaining access into USA.\n\nShe commenced traveling throughout Europe, conducting lectures and publishing her work during the 1920s and 30s. In 1931, she published her autobiography, entitled \u2018Living My Life\u2019. In 1934, Emma\u2019s dream to return to the US came true, however, it was only granted for a brief period of 90 days as she was invited on a lecture tour. In 1940, Emma Goldman\u00a0suffered a severe stroke during a trip to Canada where she was working to garner support for the anti-Franco efforts in Spain. She died on May 14, 1940 after suffering for several months in Toronto. According to her wish, she was laid to rest in Chicago, USA."

    "name": "Epictetus",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/epictetus.jpg",
    "content": "One of the most notable philosophers of the discipline of Stoicism, Epictetus was born in 55 AD to a slave woman in Hierapolis, a Greek city located in Asia Minor. Epictetus means \u2018acquired\u2019, which is a reference to his status as a slave during most of his youth. Epictetus and his mother were owned by Epaphroditus, who served as an administrator at Nero\u2019s court. He spent most of his youth in Rome, but he had to leave Rome when Epaphroditus came into some disaccord with the Domitian\u2019s government. Epictetus was not treated harshly by his master, in fact, he was allowed the exclusive privilege to pursue education, and due his master\u2019s influential social status, Epictetus benefitted from the tutelage of Musonius Rufus, an influential philosopher of the Stoic discipline.\n\nUpon gaining his freedom, Epictetus began teaching philosophy and constructing his own ideologies. In 89 AD, Domitian exiled all philosophers from Rome, hence, Epictetus was forced to leave his native city as well. He settled in Nicopolis, in Northwest Greece and founded his own school. In Nicopolis, Epictetus found the fame that was denied to him in the constricting atmosphere of Rome, it is said that his influenced even transcended that of Plato\u2019s. His institute was frequented by the most eminent Roman philosophers, and his students included affluent citizens such as, Flavian Arrian.\u00a0 Arrian is also largely responsible for collecting, compiling and editing the works of Epictetus, which, despite his painstaking meticulousness remain partial and incomplete. Epictetus\u2019 works have been conveyed to the masses mainly through the efforts of his pupil, and it is still widely debated whether the works were his own or that of his Flavian Arrian. His works can be found in the eight books of the \u2018Discourses\u2019 and \u2018Encheiridion\u2019, however, his theories appear as scattered and uncoordinated due to their disorganization.\n\nThe Discourses contains his theories on a wide range of diverse subjects such as fear, poverty, illness and anger. Epictetus\u2019 philosophies provide the approach to construct a fulfilling and peaceful life, to continuously improve the circumstances and essence of one\u2019s existence, and to excel in one\u2019s abilities. Epictetus introduced the concept of achieving eudemonia to the Stoic school of philosophy, which can be literally translated as flourishing and refers to attaining a state of contentment and blissful satisfaction.\n\nThe Encheiridion, also called The Handbook in English, provides discourse on day-to-day events that we all encounter, and basically serves as a simplification of the philosophies put forward in the Discourses. It talks about free will and power, and explains power as a course of action taken towards circumstances, for fulfilment of desires and to create diversions. It goes on to advocate that our body, property, official positions, and reputations are not within our power and thus subjected to restrain and the power of other individuals, whereas the things that lie within the sphere of our power are free by the course of nature. Epictetus proposes that if one assumes that the things which lie outside our power and are subjected to the authority and command of others, are actually controllable and can be manipulated, one will suffer from hindrances, difficulties and will eventually end up blaming one\u2019s fate and society. However, if one is able to distinguish between the affairs that our controllable and the one\u2019s that can be subjected to our authority, one can form a balance in life, and be able to lead life with free will and without any disturbances. For centuries, the teachings of The Handbook have served as a guide for Christians and Pagans alike.\n\nEpictetus\u2019 mainly dealt with the construction of a moral philosophy that could aid mankind in the construction and improvement of a better life. He wanted his teachings to practical and rational, yet at the same time, they provided individuals with tools of moral consultation and self-reflection. Epictetus placed much emphasis on the strong development of character, and believed that fear creates hindrances, therefore, humans should not attempt to change things that cannot be changed. His teachings preach that while externalities are unchangeable, the internal of an individual is subjected to constant change and development, and the circumstances that create fright and panic, can be altered from unfavorable to favorable, depending on how they are dealt with. He further stated that humans are not fearful of events or circumstances, but rather the conceptual framework of the events and the terror that accompanies with the understanding of their notions. And one can only overcome his fears if he takes control of his emotions, instructs himself and does not give in to fear by acting rationally.\n\nEpictetus\u2019 philosophical contributions have played a vital role in the evolution of the Stoic school of philosophy. His work had influenced the masses for centuries, and was also adopted by Emperor Marcus Aurelius as the central doctrine of his empire."

    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/epicurus.jpg",
    "content": "One of the most eminent philosophers of the Hellenistic period and the founder of the school of philosophy entitled Epicureanism, Epicurus was born in February 341 BCE, to parents, Neocles and Chaerestrate. His father had settled in the Athenian society on the Aegean island of Samos a few years before his birth, and Epicurus was brought up in Samos. He earned his basic education in philosophy for four years, under the tutelage of the Platonist teacher Pamphilus. At the age of 18, Epicurus served in the military for two years in Athens. Upon the death of Alexander the Great, the Athenian tribes settled in Samos were driven out to Colophon by Perdiccas. Epicurus joined his family in Colophon after completing his military service, and there, he resumed his studies under the tutelage of Nausiphanes, who enlightened him with the teachings of Democritus.\n\nAfter completing his education, Epicurus began teaching in Mytilene, however, he had to leave Colophon after getting embroiled in certain disputes. He then settled in Lampsacus, where he founded a school and resumed teaching. The year of 306 BCE saw Epicurus return to Athens, and he remained there until his death in 270 BCE. In Athens, Epicurus purchased some land and founded a school which was given the name of \u2018The Garden\u2019, for its construction in the garden of his house. The Garden soon became a notable institute for the progress of philosophical education, and it also held the exclusivity of being the first philosophical Greek institute that allowed women to take part in academic endeavours. Epicurus strongly advocated friendship as an important catalyst for a happy and fulfilling life, and thus, his school provided the community with the opportunity to interact and form constructive relationships.\n\nEpicurus has played an extremely vital role in the progress of science as a discipline, and his accentuation of the employment of direct observations and logical deductions has immensely contributed to the advancement of scientific research methods. His egalitarian ideologies emerged as the prominent philosophies of the Axial age, and he was the first to develop the concept of the \u2018Ethic of Reciprocity\u2019. Epicurus\u2019 teachings had their inspiration from many Greek philosophers, mainly Democritus, as both had similar theories about the world\u2019s composition of invisible bits of matter floating through space. However, his teachings conflicted with Democritus on the view that atoms often deviate from the normal course instead of always forming a straight lined path. Furthermore, Epicurus was the first Greek philosopher to attempt to break free society from religious superstitions by preaching that God does not punish or reward humans, and that a man\u2019s sole objective should be to form a self-sufficient and happy life by surrounding oneself with reliable and cherished friends. Epicurus was a strong advocate of free will.\n\nEven though Epicurus actively took part in religious activities, he still discarded the notion of God being an entity that is concerned with punishing evil and rewarding good deeds. The development of a pleasant and comfortable life, in his view, was the core purpose of life, and good and bad consequences could only be evaluated on the principles of pain and pleasure. Epicurus believed that whatever serves to provide pleasure can be termed as good, and whatever leads to discomfort can be termed as bad. His goal was not to encourage his disciples to run after a selfish pursuit of pleasure, but rather to form a thinking that is not plagued with religious superstition and fear. He taught that the absence of pain also leads to the absence of the need to seek pleasure, and only thus, can one attain the state of perfect mental bliss. He advocated against any sort of overabundance as he believed, all excesses eventually lead to pain. He applied the same rule to love and other feelings, including fear of death. Epicurus saw death as the end of all consciousness and stimulation of feelings, hence, he preached that no pain or pleasure shall result from the advent of death.\n\nEpicurus\u2019 teachings have influenced countless of thinkers, movements, and philosophical revolutions throughout history.\u00a0 The minds behind the construction of the French Revolution were influenced by the Epicurus\u2019 concept of \u2018Ethic of Reciprocity\u2019 which basically teaches increasing happiness and lessening harm. His Egalitarian ideologies have fueled the inspiration for various revolutionary movements centuries after his death, such as the American freedom movement and the Declaration of Independence. Unfortunately, Epicurus\u2019 contributions to philosophy are available in own three surviving complete works which can be found in book X Diogenes Laertius\u2019s \u2018Lives of Eminent Philosophers\u2019, under two groups of quotes, entitled as \u2018The Principle Doctrines\u2019, which were composed by Epicurus. Very little of his work done in his thirty-seven volume treaties \u2018On Nature\u2019 was discovered at the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum.\n\nEpicurus died in 270 BCE at the age of 72 after a prolonged suffrage with kidney stones."

    "name": "Francis Bacon",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/francis-bacon.jpg",
    "content": "Esteemed British statesman and philosopher, Francis Bacon, was born on\u00a0January 22, 1561, in York House, London. Bacon was born in to nobility, his father, Sir Nicholas Bacon, served as the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. Francis was the youngest child of Lord Nicholas and Lady Anne. At the age of 12, Bacon was accepted into the Trinity College in 1573. He completed his education at Trinity College in 1575, and enrolled himself at the Honourable Society of Gray\u2019s Inn to pursue legal education. During his years at Gray\u2019s Inn, Bacon began to show an inclination towards the new Renaissance Humanism rather than the more prevalent ideologies of Aristotelianism and Scholasticism.\n\nIn 1576, Bacon journeyed to France as a part of the English ambassador, Sir Amyas Paulet\u2019s entourage, however, he had to return to England after two and a half years, upon news of his father\u2019s sudden demise. This was a huge setback for an 18 year old Francis, as he now had very few financial means to sustain his lifestyle. Bacon struggled to make ends meet, but fortunately, in 1581, he was given a position for Cornwall in the House of Commons. He returned to Gray\u2019s Inn and continued with his education, and in 1582, he received the title of a barrister. Bacon\u2019s political career shot up in 1584, when he composed his first political memorandum, \u2018A Letter of Advice to Queen Elizabeth\u2019. Bacon remained a notable member of the parliament for almost four decades, he was extremely prominent at the Royal court, actively taking part in all legal and political activities. Bacon used his free time to tend to his philosophical passions, and he composed several works on politics, legalities, knowledge and science. He published his first work in 1597, a collection of essays on politics. In 1605, he published \u2018The Advancement of Learning\u2019 to garner support for the study of science, however, the book did not reap much success. It took him four years to give up on his attempts to rally support for political and scientific education, and in 1609, he published \u2018On the Wisdom of the Ancients\u2019, his research of ancient mythology.\n\nUpon James I\u2019s ascension to the throne, Francis Bacon was made a knight. In 1607, the title of solicitor general was bestowed upon him, and six years later, he was made attorney general. His career at court reached new heights, and in 1616, he was made a member of the Privy Council. A year later, in 1617, Bacon was made the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, a position his father had once held. And in 1618, he even transcended his father\u2019s achievements upon his promotion to the grandest political office in the royal court, the Lord Chancellor. Meanwhile, he also contributed to the evolution of philosophical science, he resumed working on his analysis on science, and in 1620, he published the first volume of \u2018Novum Organum Scientiarum\u2019, his much celebrated and widely discussed work. In 1622, he was commissioned by Prince Charles to write a historical piece, which was published as \u2018The History of Henry VII\u2019. During the same year, he also released \u2018Historia Ventorum\u2019 and \u2018Historia Vitae et Mortis\u2019.\n\nIn 1621, Bacon held the title of Viscount St. Albans. However, the same year, his political career became the target of various controversies as his rivals accused him of spreading corruption in Parliament by accepting bribes. Bacon\u2019s case was tried, and after confessing his crimes, he was sentenced to the Tower of London and fined a grand amount of 40,000 pounds. Fortunately, he was released after four days, but he had to sacrifice his reputation and his position in the Parliament that he had held for four decades.\n\nThe distressing scandal had a mentally agonizing effect on his health, and at the age of sixty, Bacon retired and settled in St. Albans. Free from the strain of work, Francis now had the time to fuel his passion for scientific philosophy. Francis was determined, more than ever, to leave his mark in the discipline of natural philosophy. Bacon established his own approach of researching scientific phenomena. He emphasised the need of first hand observations and experimentation, and developed the scientific method of gathering, analysing and experimenting data, which he believed to be immensely beneficial in aiding human kind when dealing with complex phenomenon. In 1623, he released another book on scientific reform, entitled \u2018De Augmentis Scientarium\u2019. A year later, he published two more books, \u2018The New Atlantis\u2019 and \u2018Apothegms\u2019. His last work, \u2018Sylva Sylvarium\u2019, was published in 1627. He passed away on April\u00a09,\u00a01626, after being inflicted with a severe cold while experimenting with ice.\n\nToday, Bacon\u2019s literary contributions are regarded as a core stimulant in the evolution of natural philosophy and scientific methodology. Bacon\u2019s struggle to do away with the antiquated systems is recurrent in all his works, and his efforts to develop an organised system of obtaining and interpreting data have played a vital role in advancing human understanding."

    "name": "Friedrich Engels",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/friedrich-engels.jpg",
    "content": "Friedrich Engels, an illustrious German philosopher, was born on November 28, 1820 in Barmen, Rhine province, Prussia. His father was an affluent businessman, who owned a textile factory and was also a partner in a cotton plant in Manchester, England. Engels and his father had very different plans for his career, Engels began to exhibit radical philosophies from a very young age while his father was adamant to carve out a career in commerce for him. The two often sparred on this issue, and Engels was just as unyielding as his father. He did not complete his secondary education, and began publishing articles on philosophy and economics under the pseudonym of Friedrich Oswald. Meanwhile, in 1838, he also appeased his father by working at an export firm, due to which Engels could not benefit from a university education. Engels voluntarily served in an artillery regiment for a year, and was applauded for his military prowess. Upon settling in Berlin, Engels discovered the works banned authors such as Ludwig Borne, Karl Gutzkow, Heinrich Heine and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, of which Hegel influenced him the most and he openly embraced the Hegelian society. Along with Bruno Bauer and Max Stirner, he joined the \u2018Young Hegelians\u2019 society and accepted the Hegelian dialect. The society converted an agnostic Engels into an atheist militant, this conversion was made easy by his radical inclinations against the foundations of Christianity and repressive social notions.\n\nIn 1843, Engels encountered Moses Hess, who convinced him to believe that communism is the only logical solution to progress, and advised him to go to England, where class differences were becoming more and more prominent. Engels cajoled his father into sending him to work at his textile plant in Manchester, to which his father happily agreed. In England, Engels made remarkable progress at work and used his free time to read and compose articles on economic and political scenarios. He began researching on issues such as child labor and the lives and conditions of the workers. His articles began to get acclaim upon being published in magazines such as \u2018The Northern Star\u2019, \u2018New Moral World\u2019 and the \u2018Democratic Review\u2019, and he became an enthusiastic supporter of English labor and Chartist movements. In 1844, he decided to return to Germany, and during his journey, he met Karl Marx in Paris, an encounter that would lead to a lifelong friendship. Engels assisted Marx in writing a critic on the \u2018Young Hegelians\u2019 which would be published as \u2018The Holy Family\u2019. In 1845, Engels published \u2018The Conditions of the Working Class\u2019.\n\nIn 1845, Engels went to Brussels to join Marx in organizing the German workers like the French and English workers were uniting. They became members of the German Communist League, and were asked to draft a manifesto for the organization, which is now widely known as the Communist Manifesto. In 1848, Marx and Engels began openly participating in the revolution that had spread to Prussia from France. They settled in Cologne, and began editing a paper, Neue Rheinische Zeitung, that spread their revolutionary notions advocating that a democracy would be the first step towards communism. However, in 1849, the Prussian government shut down the paper and revoked Marx\u2019s Prussian citizenship. Engels did not leave Prussia for some time, and organized an uprising in South Germany, but upon its failure he fled to England and reunited with Marx.\n\nBack in England, Marx and Engels began reconstructing the Communist League. Funds began to get scarce, and while Marx was busy working on Das Kapital, Engels decided to go back to work at his father\u2019s textile plant in Manchester. In 1864, he was made a partner at the plant due to his impressive and productive work record. Engels kept in touch with Marx throughout his life, and also supported him financially until Marx\u2019s death. He assisted Marx in editing a few articles as Marx regarded him as highly informed on economics, political and military issues. In 1896, these articles were published under Engels\u2019 name as the \u2018Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Germany in 1848\u2019. The same year, Engels sold off his share in the plant and moved to London to work with Marx. They worked together till Marx\u2019s death in 1883.\n\nAfter Marx\u2019s death, Engels struggled to keep the spirit of communism alive, and gained the status of the first Marxist. He held regular correspondence with the German Social Democrats and other followers all over Europe. He also undertook the task of compiling the second and third volumes of Das Kapital, using Marx\u2019s extensive research to assist him. Engels made several notable contributions to the field of political and economic philosophy, including highly acclaimed works such as \u2018The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State\u2019 and \u2018Ludwig Feuerbach and the Outcome of Classical German Philosophy\u2019. Friedrich Engels died on August 5, 1895, after a prolonged battle with throat cancer."

    "name": "Friedrich Hayek",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/friedrich-hayek.jpg",
    "content": "Friedrich Hayek, a renowned Austrian-British philosopher and economist, was born on\u00a0May 8, 1899 as Friedrich August von Hayek, in Vienna, Austria. Hayek hailed from an affluent and noble family, his father, August von Hayek was a famous botanist and renowned physician. Hayek\u2019s upbringing was extremely educational and scholarly, his father encouraged him to study the works of influential philosophers including Hugo de Vries and Ludwig Feuerbach. During high school, Hayek came under the influence of the lecturers he attended on Aristotle\u2019s ethics. In 1917, he had to discontinue his studies as he was called to serve the Austro-Hungarian army at the Italian border, as a part of an artillery regiment. Following the war, Hayek devoted his time to pursue his education and to analyse the events that led to the outbreak of the WWI.\n\nHayek\u00a0was a remarkable student, he enrolled at the University of Vienna and extensively studied philosophy, psychology and economics. He earned his doctorates in law and political science. When the University of Vienna was briefly shut down, Hayek attended the Constantin von Monakow\u2019s Institute of Brain Anatomy and spent his time Manakow\u2019s laboratory. His explorations on brain cells and the work of Ernst Mach influenced him to make his first academic contribution, \u2018The Sensory Order\u2019, which was published later in 1952. Upon reading \u2018Socialism\u2019 by Ludwig von Mises, Hayek became very influenced by the teachings of the philosopher and began attending the private seminars of Ludwig von Mises. Ludwig soon became his mentor, and helped to promote his career. Hayek was a regular attendant at the biweekly seminar hoster by Ludwig, and he qualified for the Habilitation exam, which proved his intellectual abilities capable of being a university teacher.\n\nFriedrich Hayek was employed by the Austrian government to work as an expert on drafting the legal and economic details of the Saint Germain. He was also appointed as the director of the recently founded Austrian Institute for Business Cycle Research. In 1929, Hayek published his first book, \u2018Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle\u2019. In 1931, he was invited to deliver four lectures on monetary economics at the prestigious institute, London School of Economics and Political Science. In England, Hayek also participated in a debate with renowned economist, Keynes, on their specific theories on the role and impacts of currency on a developed economy. Hayek has been one of Keynes most prominent critics, in his books, \u2018Prices and Production\u2019 published in 1931 and \u2018The Pure Theory of Capital\u2019, he\u00a0strongly opposed Keynes models of economic thought, however, his publications did not enjoy the same popularity as Keynes\u2019.\n\nIn 1950, Hayek secured a position of professor in the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago. He spent the next 12 years in Chicago, and during this period he published and wrote several works on the philosophy of science, political philosophy and economics. He published a book on political philosophy, \u2018The Constitution of Liberty\u2019 in 1960, and later, \u2018The Creative Powers of a free Civilization\u2019. In 1962, he moved to West Germany, upon accepting a position at the University of Freiburg in Breisgau. He served there for the next 8 years, until his retirement in 1968. Meanwhile, he also served as an honorary professor at the University of Salzburg, in Austria. In 1977, Hayek returned to Freiburg and finished his book, \u2018Law, Legislation and Liberty\u2019, which was a critical analysis of the redistribution of income under the farce of social justice. The book was issued in three volumes. In the 1980\u2019s Hayek began composing his last critic of socialism, however, due to his failing health, he had to avail the assistance of philosopher William W. Bartley in editing his last work, \u2018The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism\u2019, which was published in 1988.\n\nFriedrich Hayek\u2019s academic contributions to the fields of economics, psychology and political philosophy were awarded by a Nobel Prize in 1974. He died on\u00a0March 23, 1922, in Freiburg, Germany."

    "name": "Friedrich Nietzsche",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/friedrich-nietzsche.jpg",
    "content": "Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche was 19th century German philosopher whose writings reflected ideas of morality, religion, and science. His works were based upon ideas of good and evil and the end of religion in the modern world. His philosophy is mainly referred to as \u201cexistentialism\u201d, a famous twentieth century philosophy focusing on man\u2019s existential situation. In his works, Nietzsche questioned the basis of good and evil. He believed that heaven was an unreal place or \u201cthe world of ideas\u201d. His ideas of atheism were demonstrated in works such as \u201cGod is dead\u201d. He argued that the development of science and emergence of a secular world were leading to the death of Christianity. His philosophy inspired many of his contemporaries, although none of them agreed completely with their true meaning.\n\nNietzsche was born on 15th October 1844 in R\u00f6cken bei L\u00fctzen, a German village near Leipzig. Although born in a Christian family, Nietzsche was essentially an atheist. His father Karl Lugwig Nietzsche died when Nietzsche was five years old, which is why most of his upbringing was done by his mother, Franziska Ludwig.\n\nNietzsche completed his initial education at a preparatory school in Naumburg. He then moved to the prestigious Schulpfrota boarding School. In 1864 after graduating from school, he enrolled in the University of Bonn, for two semesters to study theology and philosophy, after which he transferred to the University of Leipzig. In 1868 during his time at the University of Leipzig, Nietzsche became acquainted with a musician named Richard Wagner. Nietzsche\u2019s inclination towards arts, literature and music attracted him towards Wagner. He was inspired by Wagner\u2019s musical and cultural influence and admired him for his compelling personality. Their friendship soon grew so much that in one of his later works Nietzsche described it as the \u201cgreatest achievement\u201d of his life.\n\nIn 1869 Nietzsche was offered a position in The University of Basel, where he began to teach on the classical teaching faculty, at the age of 24. It was during this period that he published his first book \u201cThe birth of tragedy\u201d in 1872. Towards the end of his university career he published his second book \u201cHuman all too human\u201d in 1878. Nietzsche resided in Switzerland from 1872 to 1879, during this time he continued his friendship with Wagner, often visiting him in his home. Many believe that Wagner\u2019s anti-sematic ideas greatly influenced Nietzsche. In 1879 Nietzsche\u2019s health started deteriorating and this caused him to resign from his post at the university in June 1879.\n\nBetween 1880 to 1889 Nietzsche kept moving between various cities of Switzerland, Germany and France. During this time around 1882 Nietzsche fell in love with Lou von Salom\u0117, a philosophy student from Zurich. Their relationship however, failed to develop at a romantic level.\n\nIn January 1889 in Turin, Italy, Nietzsche underwent a mental breakdown that incapacitated him for the rest of his life. There are different speculations as to what might have been the cause of this breakdown, many maintain that it was due to a condition he inherited from his father, who died due to similar causes. He was briefly hospitalized in 1889 after which his mother brought him to live with her in his childhood home in Naumburg. He lived there for the following seven years of his life. In 1897 after his mother\u2019s death Nietzsche\u2019s sister Elisabeth assumed responsibility for his care and comfort. She also took charge of promoting and preserving his writings.\n\nOn 25th August 1900, at the age of 56, Nietzsche died. The cause of death was described as a combination of pneumonia and stroke. His body was buried in family graveyard close to his mother and sister\u2019s graves."

    "name": "George Berkeley",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/george-berkeley.jpg",
    "content": "George Berkeley was an Anglo-Irish clergyman, a great philosopher and metaphysician of the early modern period. Born on March 12, 1685 in Ireland, Berkeley was a critic of philosophers like Locke and Malebranche, and was a defender of immaterialism, which was later famously called as subjective idealism, according to which our reality consists of what we perceive of it.\n\nBerkeley\u2019s philosophy relies heavily on the \u2018spirit\u2019 and \u2018idea\u2019 of things. \u2018Spirit\u2019 refers to the conscious thoughts and ideas of the mind while \u2018idea\u2019 is near to the conscious experience of day to day activities. According to Berkeley, the reality of an event to a person is his spirit and idea of that event.\n\nBerkeley\u2019s first major work, An Essay towards a New Theory of Vision, was published in 1709 in which the limitations of human vision were\u00a0discussed. \u00a0He also gave forth a theory which states that objects are not merely viewed by the human eye based on their material, but also their light and color.\n\nIn his two most famous works of metaphysics, The\u00a0Principles of Human Knowledge and Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous, Berkeley targets the materialist notions of his predecessor John Locke and presents his own views on conceivability and perceived imagination.\n\nGeorge Berkeley denied the idea of matter as something being metaphysical, but never denied the existence of material objects such as books, doors and tables. This basic claim of his ideas is often termed as Immaterialism.\n\nIn Principles, he wrote\u00a0\u201cesse is percipi\u201d\u00a0(to be is to be perceived). This phrase means that everything we know or think we know comes to us through our senses of one kind of another, sight, smell, touch, hearing and taste. If a person cannot sense it, how can he be sure of its existence?\n\nBerkeley held the belief that a thing might exist if it was not actually perceived at the current moment but may be perceived if appropriate steps are taken towards it. This view was contrary to the Materialists\u2019 theory, which stated that things only exist when perceived and then succumbed to nothingness when they are not apparent to the senses. Thus a book was only lying on the table if a person sees and touches it, and is there no more when it is out of sight and touch. Berkeley opposed it by saying that the book is still there, and is still perceivable, even if it\u2019s not being currently perceived by an individual.\n\nIn addition to his contributions to philosophy, Berkeley was also very influential in the development of mathematics and philosophy of physics. \u00a0In his work\u00a0De Motu\u00a0(1721), he rejected\u00a0Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s theory of absolute\u00a0space,\u00a0time, and\u00a0motion, and argued that forces and gravity, as defined by Newton, constituted \u201coccult qualities\u201d that expressed nothing distinctly.\n\nAs a staunch believer in Christianity and as a bishop, Berkeley believed God to be present as an immediate\u00a0cause\u00a0of all our experiences.\n\nThe relation between immaterialism and traditional religion is a fairly obvious one. Materialism leads to atheism, doubt and skepticism, since it propagates the idea that things may not exist beyond our perception of them. On the other hand, immaterialism restores the faith in God by making his existence evident. Everyday experiences of perception deduce that a human\u2019s sensory ideas must be caused by a greater being, considering the complexities of perceptions and senses, and that merciful, greater being is God.\n\nBishop Berkeley\u2019s last major philosophical work,\u00a0Siris\u00a0(1744), advocates the medicinal use of\u00a0tar water, and further discusses a wide range of topics including philosophy, science and theology.\n\nHe passed away on 14th janauary 1753, but his philosophy lived on. In the 20th century, right after the First World War, his work became the centre of attention of many philosophers as he tackled grave issues of perception, sight, senses and importance of language etc."

    "content": "George Herbert Mead, an influential American philosopher and one the founders of Pragmatism, was born on\u00a0February 27, 1863 in South Hadley, Massachusetts, United States. Mead came from a conventional Christian background, and spent many years of his life dealing with a personal spiritual crisis due to his fundamental doubts about religion and Christianity in particular. He studied at Oberlin College and later at the Harvard University. Mead was deeply discontented with the dominant speculative approach and its failure to provide an answer to the ongoing social and scientific problems. He moved to Berlin in search of a more realistic philosophy, and ended up writing a dissertation at the University of Berlin. During his stay in Germany, he not only studied philosophy, but also had a first-hand experience of the political workings of the Social-Democratic Labor Movement. This involvement later encouraged him to take an active part in the American Social Reform.\n\nIn 1891, Mead secured a job as an instructor of philosophy and psychology at the University of Michigan. There he began a lifelong friendship with another young philosophy professor, John Dewey. In 1894, Dewey was presented with the offer to teach at the University of Chicago, Dewey accepted the proposition on a condition that required George Herbert Mead to be given a position there as well. Hence, in 1894, Mead along with Dewey, went to the University of Chicago and took up the post of a professor of philosophy, which he held for the next forty years. At Chicago, Mead was an active participant in various local movements and social programs. He was appointed as the treasurer of the Hull House, admitted as a member to the progressive City Club and also, made the editor of the Elementary School Teacher.\n\nMead\u2019s influence in the University of Chicago was immense. In 1931, Mead and four other philosophers created a nationwide stir by resigning from the University in opposition to Mortimer Adler\u2019s appointment to the philosophy department. Mead was strongly against Adler\u2019s neothomist approach, and believed that his appointment would bring about a disruptive philosophical and political change within the students. Upon his resignation, Mead accepted a post at the Columbia University. However, he died soon after.\n\nMead did not publish any of his work, and upon his death, his son and daughter in law, Henry and Irene Tufts Mead, along with some of his students, edited and compiled his unpublished manuscripts, lectures and student notes. His works have been published posthumously as a three-volume set, \u2018Mind, Self and Society\u2019 was published in 1934, \u2018Movements of Thoughts in the Nineteenth Century\u2019 was published in 1936 and the \u2018Philosophy of the Act\u2019 was published in 1938. An edited version of his Carus lectures that form the main crux of Mead\u2019s philosophical teachings was published as \u2018The Philosophy of the Present\u2019, in 1932.\n\nGeorge Herbert Mead ranks amongst the most influential contributors to the field of American Pragmatism. His teachings were formed on the theory of relativity and the doctrine of emergence. According to Mead, life, consciousness, personality and experiences were valued as objective properties of nature which are relative to a specific set of circumstances. His philosophy is widely known as Objective Relativism. Mead has also made several notable contributions to social psychology. His theories put forward the notion that self-awareness in human beings is shaped through the process of social interaction, and languages play an extremely significant role in development. Mead followed the behavioristic paradigm of psychology, and believed that children can learn, understand and alter behavior patterns through language."

    "content": "Jorge Agust\u00edn Nicol\u00e1s Ruiz de Santayana y Borr\u00e1s, commonly known as George Santayana, was born in Madrid, Spain on December 16, 1863. He spent his early childhood in a town name \u00c1vila. In 1872, at the age of 9 he moved to the Boston and lived there for forty years of his life. He didn\u2019t know how to speak English at first but all his work in his career was published in English. Even though he moved there at a young age, he never considered himself an American and never took an American citizenship. He never felt like he belonged in the West.\n\nFrom 1882 to 1886, George Santayana studied at Boston Latin School. He graduated from Harvard University, where he studied under famous philosophers William James and Josiah Royce. He earned his PhD from Harvard in 1889, after which he started teaching at the University. His students include poets (such as T. S. Eliot and Robert Frost), writers (such as Max Eastman), diplomats and professors. He influenced many young students and preferred their company over that of his coworkers.\n\nSantayana\u2019s work and philosophy was based on spiritual values. He was not in favor of the liberal and democratic beliefs of the Western civilization and openly voiced his opinion against it. The well-known philosopher was agnostic in his beliefs but did not undermine religion. He had a liberal and open-minded view about it. He wrote about his religious beliefs in his books \u201cReason in Religion\u201d, \u201cThe Idea of Christ in the Gospels\u201d, and \u201cInterpretations of Poetry and Religion\u201d.\n\nIn 1912, when Santayana was in Europe, his mother passed away, after which Santayana sent his resignation to Harvard and he never went back to America. He was invited back to Harvard through many offers, but he refused all of them. He moved to Rome in 1924, where he spent the rest of his years.\n\nSantayana wrote many essays and books during his life. His major works include;\n\nGeorge Santayana\u2019s quotes are famous to this day, including \u201cThose who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it\u201d and \u201cOnly the dead have seen the end of the war\u201d. He is remembered for his aphorisms, which have been used to such an extent that they have become clich\u00e9s. He led a very secluded life and never married, thus had no children. He passed away on 26th\u00a0September, 1952 in Italy while he was sleeping, at the age of 88 years."

    "name": "Giordano Bruno",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/giordano-bruno.jpg",
    "content": "Giordano Bruno was an extremely controversial figure of the Italian Renaissance, regarded as a martyr of free thought and modern scientific advancement by some, and branded as a heretic and pantheist by others. Despite these contradictory views on his personality, his remarkable contributions on mnemonic techniques, mathematics and infinite worlds cannot be denied.\n\nBruno was born as Filippo Giordano Bruno in 1548 in Nola, Naples, to parents Giovanni Giordano Bruno and Fraulissa Savolino. His father was a soldier. Bruno received his early education in Naples and under several tutors at the Augustinian monastery. Upon reaching the age of 17, Bruno was admitted to the Dominican Order of the monastery of San Domenico Maggiore in Naples, where he studied Aristotelian philosophy. Bruno changed his name to Giordano and, at the age of 24 he became an ordained priest.\n\nGiordano\u2019s art of memory earned him the attention of Pope Pius V, and he was invited to present him with a demonstration. By this time, Bruno has developed his inclination towards free thought and also took part in condemning religious doctrines, particularly through the ownership of an Erasmus book which had been banned. In light of all Bruno\u2019s conflicts with the church and its religious notions, the Inquisition began preparing an indictment against him. Thus, Bruno had to leave Naples in 1576. He began traveling around Italy for some time, and in 1577 published his work, \u2018On the Signs of the Times\u2019, which is now lost. In 1579, he settled in Geneva and began teaching at the University. However, due to certain publications against Protestantism, he was soon arrested.\n\nHe then moved to France, where he began conducting lectures on various subjects and garnered the support of various influential patrons. He lived in France for the next seven years. In 1582, Giordano published his book \u2018De Umbris Idearum\u2019 (The shadow of Ideas), and dedicated it to the French monarch, King Henry III. This action instigated the King\u2019s interest in Giordano Bruno\u2019s work and his lectures on the art of memory. Bruno flourished under the attention he garnered from the French court and patrons, and he went on to publish some of his most influential works during this period, including Ars Memoriae (The Art of Memory), and Cantus Circaeus (Circe\u2019s Song).\n\nIn 1583, Bruno moved to London, and lived at the house of the French ambassador, Michel de Castelnau. During this period, he encountered some of the prominent and influential members of the Hermetic circle, including the poet Philip Sidney who influenced Bruno so much that he dedicated two of his books to him. He travelled to Oxford to deliver lectures but never managed to secure a teaching position due to his highly controversial religious views. Bruno was an avid supporter of Copernicus\u2019 theories and in 1584, he published \u2018Cena de le Ceneri\u2019 (The Ash Wednesday Supper) in which he advocated Copernicus\u2019 heliocentric theory. In the same year, he also published \u2018De l\u2019Infinito, Universo e Mondi\u2019 (On the Infinite Universe and Worlds) where he put forward the idea of the universe as an infinite body containing an infinite number of worlds within it. Bruno was the first to present the modern concept of an infinite world. He\u00a0argued that the universe is a manifestation of God itself, God, who according to him, existed everywhere and not a singular and remote deity.\n\nBruno left England for Paris in 1585, where he did not receive a warm welcome due to the political tension his writings and publications against Aristotelian natural science has created. He decided to move to Germany, where he secured the position of delivering lectures in Wittenberg. Two years later, he went to Prague, and then Helmstedt, but no matter where he went his passion for free thought, his challenging and out spoken personality managed to attract opposition and criticism. However, despite his extensive traveling and turbulent life, Bruno managed to complete several works in Latin, such as the De Magia (On Magic), Theses De Magia (Theses On Magic) and De Vinculis In Genere (A General Account of Bonding).\u00a0 In 1591, Bruno published his highly notable work, De Imaginum, Signorum, Et Idearum Compositione (On the Composition of Images, Signs and Ideas).\n\nThe same year, Giordano returned to Italy and took up the position of a tutor to Giovanni Mocenigo. This tutorship led to his demise, as his student denounced him and his teachings to the Venetian Inquisition. In 1592, Bruno was imprisoned in Rome on the charges of blashphemy, immoral conduct, practicing magic and heresy. He died on February 17, 1600\u00a0in prison after a period of eight years."

    "content": "Gorgias was a renowned Pre-Socratic Greek philosopher, rhetorician and orator, who was ranked among the prominent figures of the first generation of Sophists. Gorgias is accredited for the rhetorical evolution of Athens and Attica, through his innovative contributions, particularly his philosophical theories that have contributed to the diffusion of the Attic dialect as the language of literary prose.\n\nGorgias was born in 483 B.C. in the Greek colony of Leontini, Sicily. His father, Charmantides, had two other children, a son named Herodicus and a daughter (unnamed). Gorgias received his early education under the tutelage of Empedocles. Gorgias\u2019s impressive oratorical style excelled even that of his teacher, and soon his fame as a practicing oratory and notable teaching rhetoric began to spread. His students include Pericles, Critias, Menos, Isocrates and Aspasia among others. Gorgias was a remarkable speaker, and his lecturers at the Panhellenic festivals became renowned and celebrated in Olympia and Delphi. His florid, rhyming style left his audience mesmerized, and his performances and rhetoric lesson left a hypnotic effect on his listeners. His was lauded for his powers of reasoning and persuasion. In 427 B.C. Gorgias was sent on a diplomatic mission to Athens, to represent his citizens as their ambassador, and implore for Athenian protection from oppression at the hands of the brutal Syracusans. Gorgias, through his effective communication skills and remarkable speeches, managed to sway many of the leading intellectuals and politicians in harmony with his cause.\n\nGorgias has made remarkable literary contributions which have paved the way for rhetoric transplantation from his native Sicily to Athens and Attica. His works have also contributed to the diffusion of the Attic dialect as the language of literary prose. He is accredited for the rhetorical developments of structure and ornamentation, and he is also acknowledged for introducing paradoxes and paradoxical expressions. His innovative contributions have earned him the title of \u201cFather of Sophistry\u201d. Gorgias\u2019 existing works on rhetoric include \u201cEncomium of Helen\u201d, \u201cthe Defense of Palamedes\u201d, \u201cOn Non-Existence\u201d (or On Nature), and \u201cEpitaphios\u201d.\n\nUnlike various other Sophists such as Protagoras, Gorgias did not approve of preaching morals or \u2018arete\u2019, for he believed that there was no absolute form of virtue, it was subjected to change based on every situation. Gorgias proclaimed that rhetoric was the king of all sciences, as it possessed the powers of persuasion to sway judgments over any particular course of action. However, eminent philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle disagreed with Gorgias over the power and capabilities of rhetoric.\n\nGorgias lived to be over one hundred year old. He died at Larissa in around 376 B.C. He had managed to hoard a great deal of wealth by the time of his death, and in his will, he commissioned a gold statue of himself, and donated it to a public temple."

    "name": "Gottfried Leibniz",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/gottfried-leibniz.jpg",
    "content": "Gottfried W. Leibniz, a remarkable and revolutionary mathematician and philosopher, who is accredited as the founder of infinitesimal calculus and the use of modern calculators, was born on July 1, 1646, in Leipzig, Germany. He came from an educated family, and his father was a lecturer of moral philosophy. Leibniz attended the Nicolai School in Leipzig, where his father taught him History. By the age of twelve, Gottfried was fluent in Latin, and had already begun training in Greek. He showed significant interest in the study of logic, and began exploring its doctrines by educating himself in the works of Protestant and Scholastic theologians. At the age of 15, Leibniz was accepted at the University of Leipzig, where he pursued a law degree. Soon, his interests were piqued by philosophy, and he began studying philosophy under the tutelage of a renowned Neo-Aristotelian, Jakob Thomasius, who is often accredited as the founder of German historical philosophy. During his time at the University of Leipzig, Gottfried encountered various modern philosophers, thinkers and revolutionists, and this interaction benefited his thinking immensely.\n\nIn 1663, he decided to study Mathematics, and hence, he began attending the lectures of an esteemed mathematician, E. Weigel, in Paris. However, he soon returned to studying law, and devoted himself to his studies for the next three years. In 1666, applied for a Post-doctoral degree at the University of Leipzig, however, his request was turned down as he was considered as too young. Gottfried was extremely let down, and he decided to join the University of Altdorf to enrol in a doctoral programme. In 1666, Leibniz received his Ph.D. in Law, along with his practice license, his thesis was entitled \u201cDisputatio Inauguralis De Casibus Perplexis in Jure\u201d. He was offered an academic position at the University of Altdorf, which he declined, as he had different things planned in his mind.\n\nBy the age of twenty one, Leibnitz had published a few essays that began to garner him acclaim for his remarkable comprehension of historical methodologies implemented in legalities and his replication of Corpus Juris. Gottfried\u2019s fortunate encounter with Christian von Boyneburg is credited for the start of his professional career, Boyneburg appointed him as his assistant. While working for Boyneburg, he was introduced to the Elector of Mainz. Leibniz presented the Elector with an essay that he had penned, impressed by his work, he was commissioned to work on the redrafting of \u2018The Legal Code\u2019 for the Electorate. In 1669, Leibniz was selected for the position of Assessor in the Court of Appeal. He remained in Boyneburg\u2019s employment till 1672, and upon his death, he continued to work for his widow for the next two years.\n\nIn 1672, Gottfried Leibniz composed and published his much discussed and praised work, \u2018Thoughts of Public Safety\u2019, where he discussed the ambitions and limitations of European powers, particularly the safety of Germany and the need for the formation of new Rheinbund to bind all Europeans in to a peaceful accord. He further encouraged the European powers, particularly France, to turn their attentions towards the unexplored lands of Egypt, and to acquire the lands of the Pagan world. In 1672, French Secretary of State, Simon Arnauld de Pomponne, invited him to Paris, the political and educational developments of France impressed him deeply. During his stay at Mainz, Gottfried was engrossed in the exploration of correlation between the old and new methodologies of philosophy, and after consultations with Jakob Thomasius, he began designing his calculating machine that would be used to perform the operations of multiplication, addition, subtraction, division and root extraction. The device was exhibited at the Academy of Paris, and later, it was presented to the Royal Society of London. In 1673, he was elected as a fellow at the Royal Society of London.\n\nIn 1676, Leibniz was invited to Hanover, where he stayed to serve the House of Brunswick as a political advisor, librarian and historian, under the rule of three kings, for the next forty years. During these years, Leibniz engaged himself in the study of logic, philosophy, physics, mathematics and calculus, and produced several works on historical, political and theological aspects. In 1674, he devoted himself to perfecting his theories on calculus and over the next three years, he developed a coherent system, which he did not publish until 1684. In 1682, Leibniz became a regular contributor to various journals and his work was applauded for his scientific and mathematical prowess. In 1687, he was commissioned by Elector Ernest Augustus to compose the history of the House of Brunswick, and thus, Leibniz began traveling to Germany, Italy and Austria in search of relevant documents to aid his project, over the course of the next three years.\n\nIn 1708, Leibniz was charged by John Keil to have deliberately plagiarized Newton\u2019s work, and this brought his career and achievements in the midst of several controversies. However, Leibniz continued with his theological and philosophical endeavours unfazed and went on to produce several more momentum works on mathematics, history, law, politics and science. His health began to deteriorate, and he passed away on\u00a0November\u00a014,\u00a01716. Gottfried Leibniz\u2019s work has played an extremely pivotal role in laying down the foundation of the digital computers, similarly his evolutionary theories on the mathematical concepts of differentiation and integration have also enhanced the academic resources of engineering and mechanics."

    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/hannah-arendt.jpg",
    "content": "Hannah Arendt, a Jewish political theorist who caused a revolutionary stir in political philosophy, was born as Johanna Arendt on October 14, 1906, in Hanover, Germany. Hannah belonged to an underprivileged family, and after the death of her father at a very young age, her struggle with limited financial means intensified. Hannah received her education at various universities, her time spent at the University of Marburg highlights the commencement of her political and radical affiliations, and there she worked with Martin Heidegger for a brief period. Arendt received her doctorate in 1928, from the University of Heidelberg. She conducted her doctoral thesis on Saint Augustine under the supervision of Karl Jaspers.\n\nUpon completing her education, Hannah tied the knot with Gunther Stern, and began her involvement in political activism and agitations. Hannah began gathering evidence on the Nazi regime\u2019s anti-Semitic practices. However, the constricting and strict Nazi Party took notice of her activities and Arendt began encountering disturbances. Her difficulties increased and in 1933, she was forced to flee her homeland. Hannah sought refuge in Paris, and there, she began working for the Youth Aliyah, an organization devoted to rescuing impoverished Jewish children from Eastern Europe. In 1940, Hannah remarried, this time to Heinrich Blucher. The anti-Jew movement propagated by the Nazi Party began to gain momentum, and Jews all over Germany began to leave Germany to seek refuge from the brutally oppressive and dehumanizing tactics of the government. Tragedy struck her life, when Hannah and her husband were sent\u00a0to concentration camp in Gurs, France, however, fortunately, Hannah and Blucher managed to escape the camp, and in 1941, they left for the US.\n\nIn the USA, Hannah began formulating her experiences in war ridden anti-Jew Germany and the horrors she experienced at the concentration camp in to one of her highly acclaimed and widely discussed work, \u2018The Origins of Totalitarianism\u2019, which she published in 1951. Through this book, she provided an in depth analysis into the autocratic and oppressive regimes of Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin. Her fame began to spread, and she became known as a prominent philosopher on Jewish affairs in the post-World War II society and totalitarianism. In 1951, Arendt received her US citizenship.\n\nIn 1958, she published another groundbreaking philosophic masterpiece, \u2018The Human Condition\u2019, she had found the inspiration for this work from Ancient Greek culture, and sought to critically examine the boundaries and limitations of the modern world. In this book, Hannah dealt with the human aims and struggles to work, act and labor, and she examined how these aims and struggles made an impact on four crucial facets of life: Social, private, public and political. In 1961, she was selected by the New Yorker magazine as a reporter to cover the scandalous trial of Nazi war criminal, Adolf Eichmann, held in Jerusalem. She published her observations of the trial in 1963, entitled \u2018Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil\u2019, in which she portrayed Eichmann as a brutally ambitious bureaucrat who put no value to human life in pursuit of him ambitions. She also began conducting lectures at the University of Chicago and Princeton.\n\nIn 1967, Arendt was offered the position of a professor of philosophy at the New School for Social Research, located in New York. Hannah continued writing and observing political scenarios and in 1972, she published yet another remarkable work, \u2018Crises of the Republic\u2019. She also did ample research on the cognitive abilities of the human body to think, perceive and act, she began compiling a trilogy entitled, \u2018The Life of the Mind\u2019, in which she divided her cognitive examination in three parts: Thinking, willing and judging. However, tragically Hannah did not live long enough to finish the three-volume book, as she passed away on\u00a0December\u00a04,\u00a01975, due to heart failure.\n\nHannah Arendt has made several significant literary contributions that continue to influence the masses to this day. Some of her highly acclaimed works include \u2018Between Past and Future\u2019, \u2018Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil\u2019, \u2018The Human Condition\u2019, \u2018The Jew as Pariah: Jewish Identity and Politics in the Modern Age\u2019, \u2018The Life of the Mind\u2019, \u2018Men in Dark Times\u2019, \u2018On Revolution\u2019, \u2018The Origins of Totalitarianism\u2019 and \u2018Rahel Varnhagen: The Life of a Jewish Woman\u2019.

    "content": "Henry David Thoreau was born on July 12, 1817 in Concord, Massachusetts. Thoreau is\u00a0best known as an American author, poet, philosopher, naturalist, abolitionist, historian, and one of the leading transcendentalists of his time. Henry David Thoreau was born to John Thoreau, a pencil maker and Cynthia Dunbar. Included in the family were his older siblings Helen and John Jr. as well as younger sibling Sophia. Between 1833 and 1837 Thoreau studied at Harvard University taking courses in classics, mathematics, science, and philosophy. In 1835, Thoreau took a leave of absence from university studies to teach a school in Canton, Massachusetts. Upon graduation in 1837 he joined the faculty of Concord public school, only to resign a few weeks later due to his disdain and opposition to corporal punishment. By the time of 1838, both John and Henry opened a grammar school called Concord Academy introducing progressive teaching concepts there. These included visits to local businesses and markets as well as nature walks. However, the school was shut done in 1842 due to the fatal illness of John Thoreau from tetanus which then led to his death.\n\nOn returning to Concord after graduation, Thoreau met Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emerson began urging Thoreau to contribute essays, and literary works to a quarterly periodical known as The Dial. Thoreau\u2019s first essay to be published in The Dial was Aulus Pesius Flaccus, based on a\u00a0play\u00a0of the same name which was published in 1849. Thoreau became a philosopher of nature and how it relates to the human condition. He started following\u00a0the idealist philosophy of Transcendentalism advocated by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Louisa May Alcott\u00a0and Margaret Fuller\u00a0at that time. \u00a0They believed that an \u2018ideal\u2019 spiritual state goes beyond the physical state when one achieves that insight through personal instinct. From 1841 to 1844, Thoreau served as a tutor to children, editorial assistant and repairman for the House of Emerson. Later on he moved back to Concord to work in the family pencil factory. There he rediscovered the procedure of making a good pencil out of substandard graphite by using clay as the binding component. Later Thoreau converted the pencil factory into a factory for production of graphite which was used to ink typesetting machines.\n\nReturning to Concord brought about a period of restlessness in Thoreau. On July of 1845, he began an experiment that would last for 2 years in regards to \u201csimple living\u201d. In 1854 Thoreau published Walden, or Life in the Woods which recounted his two year experiment living at the Walden Pond. In the book time is compressed into a single year symbolizing human development by using the course of the four seasons. The book is a mix, part memoir and part spiritual quest. At the time of its publication, very few people had admired the literary work. However, later on many critics began to regard the literary piece as an American classic that examines social and cultural conditions through the models of exploring harmony, beauty, and natural minimalism.\n\nCivil Disobedience was another famous work by Thoreau in he explains his\u00a0resistance to pay tax at the Concord Lyceum due to his opposition of\u00a0the Mexican-American War and slavery. He died on May 6, 1862 \u00a0from contraction of tuberculosis and bronchitis."

It was decided upon her birth that her life would be devoted to religion, hence, upon reaching the age of 8, Hildegard was admitted into the Benedictine monastery in Mount St Disibode to receive an education required for a nun. She was brought up under the supervision of a reclusive nun, Jutta of Sponheim, who later became the Mother Superior. The Benedictine monastery followed the Celtic tradition, and therefore, it was open to both men and women, although they resided in separate quarters. Hildegard spent her youth educating herself in Latin and other religious texts, and she became extremely well-versed. She also began experiencing visions where God would communicate with her, however, she kept this a secret.\u00a0 Upon reaching the age of 18, Hildegard received the status of nun, and twenty years later, 38 year old Hildegard succeeded Jutta as the Mother Superior upon her death.\n\nUpon gaining the status of Mother Superior, Hildegard had a vision where God commanded her to spread the knowledge of her visions, and hence, with the assistance of a monk, she spent the next decade compiling and describing her dreams, and also providing an analysis on their interpretation and significance. Her work came under the notice of the Papacy, and Pope Eugenius III sent a commission to inquire after the credibility of her work. The commission was very sceptical of her visions and teachings, however, the Pope discarded their views, and granted her approval. The abbey, under the supervision of Hildegard, became a sanctuary for the other nuns, and soon, it became flocked with the arrival of an increasing number of novice nuns. As a result, the abbey became overcrowded and cramped, there arose the problem of inadequate rooms for the nuns residing there. Therefore, Hildegard decided to relocate the nuns to Rupertsberg, near Bingen, where she wanted to build another monastery for them. However, this decision did not sit well with the abbot, who began creating skirmishes. In 1150, Hildegard became embroiled in a certain disaccord with the abbot, who wanted her to settle down at St. Disibod, while she was adamant to go to Rupertsberg. After a prolonged squabble, she left the abbey, accompanied by 50 nuns, and set down to the task of constructing a new abbey. She supervised the construction herself, and was even responsible for designing certain features of the building which were unusual and never proposed before during those times, such as the water pumped in through pipes.\n\nThe fame of the abbey spread, and soon, it too became cramped to the increasing influx of nuns. Hence, in order to accommodate the incomers, Hildegard began the construction of another abbey, 8 miles away from the former. Like the former abbey, Hildegard was responsible for the design of the new abbey as well. She added to the design modern ideas and plans such as water pipes and large workshops. The atmosphere in these abbeys was that of jovial co-existence and contentment, the nuns were encouraged to engage in intellectual and artistic endeavours. Hildegard was a strong advocate of reading, studying and discussing theology, taking warms baths, exercising regularly, singing and playing musical instruments. Her distrust of local water is famous, as she was the only superior to have promoted her nuns to consume beer instead of water.\n\nHildegard possessed remarkable healing abilities and she had garnered immense respect as a doctor, people began flocking to her side to benefit from her healing prowess, and soon, she gained the title of miracle woman. She even composed two books on medicine, \u2018Scivias\u2019 and \u2018Causae et Curae\u2019, that covered a wide range of medicinal cures involving herbs. She also composed works on botany, geology and biographies on the lives of saints. Hildegard was fond of drama, she wrote plays and poetry, and it is a well-known fact the she is credited for the invention of opera, as she wrote and directed the first opera ever performed. Hildegard had an incredible passion for music which she entwined with her love for composing poetry, she has written 70 poems and a musical play, entitled \u2018Ordo Virtutum\u2019. The play revolves around a human soul that is torn between listening to the Virtues and the Devil, and eventually settles for the Virtues upon realizing that following the Devil has awful consequences.\n\nHildegard travelled throughout Germany, and even to Switzerland and Paris, to preach and conduct lectures. Even though it was illegal for women to preach during those times, Hildegard\u2019s sermons were attended by hundreds of people, who were deeply inspired by her teachings and requested for written copies of her sermons. \u00a0She wrote 9 books, of which the widely discussed and acclaimed include \u2018Scivias\u2019 (Know the paths), \u2018Liber Vitae Meritorum\u2019 (ethics), and \u2018De Operatione Dei\u2019, which mainly dealt with account and interpretation of her visions, and provided great moral insight.\n\nAt the age of 80, she became embroiled in some tensions with the Church upon her defiance in burying a revolutionary on the grounds of her abbey. The Church did not deter even though she explained that the man had absolved his sons before his death, the clerics were adamant to exhume the body. Hildegard played a clever trick on the authorities who came to take the body, she blessed all the graves and removed every tombstone, which confused them and they could not tell apart one grave from the other. This angered the Church and a ban was placed on music and mass within the abbey, however, it was lifted shortly after.\n\nShe passed away on September 17,1179. In 1940, the Vatican acknowledged her devoutness and spirituality, and she was made a saint. Hildegard of Bingen was not only a philosopher and a Saint, she was also a poet, theologian, singer, author, composer, artist, playwright, doctor, herbalist, botanist, seer, preacher, biographer and architect. Her feast day is celebrated on the 17th of September."

    "name": "Hypatia",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/hypatia.jpg",
    "content": "Hypatia, the first woman to challenge the pre-set notions of nature as a mathematical philosopher in the male dominated society of Ancient Greek, was born in 370 A.D. in Alexandria, Egypt. She was born to Theon, an eminent professor at the University of Alexandria. Theon raised Hypatia as a single parent, and was extremely enamoured with the child\u2019s intelligence and capacity for knowledge. He had extremely elevated hopes of Hypatia, and he began to educate her in the disciplines of arts, science, literature and philosophy. Meanwhile, young Hypatia was also trained in physical activities such as swimming, riding and rowing. Hypatia was a gifted orator, and her skills were enhanced by her father\u2019s insistence upon training her in speech.\n\nHypatia attended school at Athens, Greece, and the fame of her mathematical prowess began to spread as she neared the completion of her education. Upon her return to Alexandria, Hypatia was requested to accept the position of Professor of Philosophy and Mathematics at the University of Alexandria. Hypatia accepted the post and began teaching, her lectures, particularly her discourse on Diophantus\u2019 \u201cArithmetica\u201d, influenced her disciples and an increasing number of students signed up for her classes. She educated her students on the teachings of Diophantus, exploring the various techniques he developed to formulate solutions to indeterminate problems, and analyzing the symbolism constructed by his theories. She also conducted lectures on the teachings of Plato and Aristotle. Hypatia\u2019s speeches were iconic and extremely rousing, people travelled from far to come and listen to her speak.\n\nHypatia is credited for several contributions to the discipline of philosophy, however the exact number of her works is unknown as many of them were destroyed during the centuries passed. Nevertheless, her existing work includes her treatise and discourses on \u201cThe Conics of Apollonius\u201d and \u201cAmagest\u201d, which include her extremely innovative analysis of Ptolemy\u2019s countless observations of the stars. She also composed an analysis on her father\u2019s work on Euclid\u2019s \u2018Elements\u2019. Hypatia intended to use all these writings to aid her disciples in comprehending difficult mathematical concepts. Among Hypatia\u2019s most influential disciples, perhaps Synesius of Cyrene was the most famous, and he also remains a credible source of much information gathered on Hypatia as a result of his letters, where he credits her for \u201ccreating an astrolabe and a planesphere\u201d, which were astronomical device, created by Hypatia to be used as instruments for distilling water, for measuring the level of water, and for concluding the specific gravity of liquids. Unfortunately, very few of these instruments constructed by Hypatia survived the ages.\n\nHypatia belonged to the Pagan school of Greek ideology, whose beliefs were in constant strife with the dominant religion of Christianity. The Neo-Platonists were regarded as heretics because, according to the Christians, they disputed and corrupted the thoughts of religious people. In 412, Hypatia\u2019s teachings and avowed dedication to Paganism began attracting criticism and hatred from the dominant Christians. The same year, Cyril took over as the patriarch of Egypt and he began embroiling Hypatia into a conspiracy by encouraging the masses to believe that Hypatia\u2019s relationship with the prefect of Egypt, Orestes, was the reason for the disputes in Egypt. This enraged the people, and in March 415, Cyril began organising a mob of religious fanatics and extremists, and convinced them to believe that Hypatia\u2019s death was the only way to bring peace and stability back to Egypt. Hence, on her way back from the university, Hypatia was chased by an angry mob. They caught up with her, pulled Hypatia out of her chariot and proceeded to strip her naked. She was hauled around, beaten, stoned, and then dragged to the church where she was butchered to tiny pieces and put to fire.\n\nHer brutal murder continues to haunt philosophers and free thinkers all over the world to this day. Hypatia\u2019s remarkable intelligent and timeless wisdom has benefited the world immensely, and she will always remain the first female to have revolutionized the field of mathematical philosophy."

    "name": "Ibn Sina",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/ibn-sina.jpg",
    "content": "Ibn Sina, also known by his Latinized name in Europe as Avicenna, was a Persian philosopher and polymath, born in 980 CE. Regarded as one of the most influential thinkers and writers of the Islamic Golden Age, Ibn Sina wrote extensively on philosophy of ethics and metaphysics, medicine, astronomy, alchemy, geology psychology and Islamic theology. He was also a logician, mathematician and a poet.\n\nBorn in Afshana, Bukhara in Central Asia, his work on medicine, specifically the Canon, or the Qanun fil Tibb, was taught in schools in the Islamic world and in Europe alike till the early modern era. His treatise on philosophy, the Cure, or al Shifa, was greatly influential on European scholastics, such as Thomas Aquinas.\n\nChiefly being a metaphysical philosopher, Ibn e Sina attempted at presenting a comprehensive system linking human existence and experiences with its contingency, while staying in harmony with the Islamic exigency. Thus, he is considered as the first significant Muslim philosopher of all times. He based his theories on God as the chief Existence, and this forms the foundations of his ideas on soul, human rationale and the cosmos. He also attempted at a philosophical interpretation of religion and religious beliefs.\n\nFor Ibn Sina, gaining education was of foremost importance. Grasping the logic and the comprehensible is the first step towards determining the fate of one\u2019s soul, thereby deciding human actions. For Ibn Sina, people can be categorized on the basis of their ability to grasp the intelligible. The highest category comprises of the prophets, who have pure rational souls and have knowledge of all things intelligible. The lowest is the person with an impure soul, who lacks the capability of developing an argument. People can elevate their position in the categories by having a rational approach, balanced temperament and by purifying their soul.\n\nIn the field of metaphysics, Ibn Sina differentiates between what exists and its essence. Essence is what comprises the nature of things, and should be recognized as something separate from the physical and mental realization of things. This difference applies to all things except God, said Ibn Sina. For him, God is the basic cause and so it is both the essence and the existence. He further argued that soul is ethereal and intangible; it cannot be destroyed. Is it the soul which compels a person to choose between good and evil in this world, and is a source of reward or punishment in the hereafter.\n\nBeing a devout Muslim himself, Ibn Sina applied rational philosophy at interpreting divine text and Islamic theology. His ultimate aim was to prove God\u2019s presence and existence and the world is His creation through scientific reason and logic. His teachings and views on theology were part of the core curriculum of various schools across the Islamic world well into the nineteenth century. Ibn Sina also penned down a significant number of short treatise on Islamic theology and the prophets, whom he termed as \u2018inspired philosophers\u2019. He also linked rational philosophy with interpretation of Quran, the holy book of muslims.\n\nIbn e Sina passed away in June 1037, in the Hamadan area of Iran. Out of his 450 various publications and treatises, almost 240 of them have survived, majority of which belongs to philosophy and medicine."

    "name": "Immanuel Kant",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/immanuel-kant.jpg",
    "content": "An eminent philosopher of the Enlightenment era, Immanuel Kant was born of April 22, 1724, in Konigsberg, Prussia. He was the fourth of nine children born to Anna Regina Reuter and Johann Georg Kant. He belonged to an impoverished family, his father was a harness marker, and the family offered unquestionable allegiance to the Pietism branch of the Lutheran Church. Kant was a bright child, he was placed under the tutelage of a local pastor to complete his basic education, and later he attended the Collegium Fridiricianum, a Latin school where developed a great passion for classicism. In 1740, Kant was accepted at the University of Konigsberg, he initially planned to study theology but he found his vocation in physics and mathematics. Upon his father\u2019s death in 1746, Immanuel was forced to leave his education and the university in order to provide financial assistance to his family.\n\nKant began working as a private tutor for wealthy families, and meanwhile, he began publishing papers that consisted of his analysis on empiricism and rationalism. Kant spent the next decade exploring a centrism between rationalism and empiricism, and he sought to create an approach to deal with scientific questions by implementing both these theologies. In 1755, Kant published his highly praised and much discussed paper, \u201cGeneral Natural History and Theory of the Heavens\u201d. In the same year, a friend provided him some financial assistance and he was able to resume his education at Konigsberg. He received his Ph.D. in 1756.\n\nAfter completing his education, Kant was offered the position of a lecturer of mathematics and sciences at the University of Konigsberg, which he accepted and held for the next 15 years. Kant employed his free time to study the complex phenomenon of scientific philosophy, and compiled some of his major works during this time. His reputation as an esteemed thinker and philosopher began to spread, and in 1770, he was offered a tenure at Konigsberg, as a professor of metaphysics and logic. In 1781, he published one of his most significant and groundbreaking works on Western ideology, \u2018Critique of Pure Reason\u2019, through which he sought to explain the relationship of reasoning and interactions with perceptions and perspectives. His rationalist and unconventional teaching methods gained much popularity among the students, and his agnostic approach in dealing with religious texts gained great momentum. However, the Prussian government took strict notice of his unorthodox approach in dealing with religious texts and King Fredrich William II who viewed his publications as a violation of the sanctity of religion, barred him from teaching or writing on religious matters in 1792. Kant obeyed this prohibition for the next five years, and upon the death of the King, he resumed his analysis of religious dialects.\n\nKant has made immense contributions to the evolution of scientific philosophy. He is attributed for the formation of a model of individual epistemology, which he believed provided an in depth analysis of human knowledge and its limitation. He entwined the ideologies of empiricism with rationalism, and attempted to examine the limits and extents of human intelligence. He always placed much emphasis on moralities, and formed his own moral law, entitled \u2018Categorical imperative\u2019, which proposed that morality is taken from rationality and, the sense of right doing and wrong doing is only obtained from rational thinking. Kant divided moral judgments into three distinct classes: analytic a priori, synthetic a posteriori and synthetic a priori. In 1797, he published \u2018Metaphysics of Ethics\u2019, in which he developed an ethical system that proposed reasoning as the fundamental power that guides morality. He stated that reasoning necessitated the need for two essential elements of thought: the categorical and the hypothetical. While the categorical forms the ethical evaluation, the hypothetical constructs a course of action to deal with events, and these two elements serve to uphold a man\u2019s freedom of thought and action, making him independent to act according to his will and engaging his conscience to make ethical decision keeping in mind the societal norms.\n\nKant continued to write until his death, however, it became increasingly difficult during his last years due to his acute memory loss. He died at the age of 79, on 12 February 1804. Kantian philosophy has influenced the masses for over centuries, and also laid down the basis for modern philosophy. Countless renowned philosophers formed their distinct theories based on the principals laid down by Immanuel Kant, of which Hegel\u2019s dialectical method and Marx\u2019s socialist philosophy are the most acclaimed."

    "name": "Iris Murdoch",

    "content": "Jean Iris Murdoch was a British philosopher and writer. Born on July 15, 1919 in Phibsborough,\u00a0Ireland, she wrote prolifically on virtue and evil, morality, ethics, sexuality and the unconscious mind. The recurring themes in Iris Murdoch\u2019s writings were the link between philosophy and psychology with a hint of humor.\n\nIn the late 1940s, when Murdoch joined University of Cambridge as a student of philosophy, she identified herself as a Platonist. She disagreed with logical positivism and sided with existentialism school of thought.\n\nShe was largely influenced by the writings of Simone Weil,\u00a0and presented criticism of Jean-Paul Sartre and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Murdoch attempted at making sense of leading a life of Goodness, as a pilgrimage between illusions to the reality of virtue.\n\nMurdoch started her philosophical journey by publishing a critique of Jean-Paul Sartre, titled Sartre: Romantic Rationalist, thus initiating a lifelong study of existentialism, criticizing it for inadequately focusing on the Other, and emphasizing greatly on the heroic self. In a nutshell, Iris Murdoch remains a moral realist. She held the belief that some realities in life are there for us to recognize, and their truthfulness doesn\u2019t depend on our perception of them. In her 1956 paper, titled Dreams and Self-Knowledge, she discusses how Goodness and morality should be perceived.\n\nNo existing ethicists have given importance to human beings as they actually are. On the contrary, they focused solely on how they should act, as per Murdoch. In her life, she struggled to propose a personal view of a human\u2019s existing morality. Recently, ethical traditions have explained why a human does what he does, as opposed to the growth of a moral \u2018character\u2019, the ultimate source of a man\u2019s morality. If existence of a moral character is to be believed, then it follows that this character becomes evident on the moment of our action, and this action is a result of a phenomenon which began long ago.\n\nMurdoch was of the belief that all are virtues are fruits of a long chain of events leading to the point of exercising of that virtue. Thus for Murdoch, having a fixed purpose in life, as taught by Aristotle, is the surest way of attaining virtue.\n\nIris Murdoch wrote 26 intelligent novels characterized by their wit, astuteness and complexity. Based on plots where characters undergo multi-faceted changes with respect to their philosophical positions, they paint a true picture of lives of the middle-class of the twentieth century. Involving the comic, the grotesque, and the macabre, Murdoch\u2019s novels intelligently tackle the Platonic vision of the Good, in which her characters show off varying degrees of morality and virtue.\n\nIn almost all her novels, Murdoch portrays how we humans believe that our actions are in our hands, and that we are free to exercise our choices, but the reality is different. In her view, all human beings succumb to the power of the unconscious mind, and various other social forces far beyond human control.\n\nIris Murdoch won the Booker Prize for her novel, The Sea, the Sea in 1978. She was also awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and the Whitbread, among various others, for her penmanship. Listed as twelfth on Time\u2019s Magazine\u2019s list of the \u201850 greatest British writers since 1945\u2019, Murdoch continues to influence the world with her words and ideas of virtue and moral goodness. She died on February 8,\u00a01999 in Oxford."

    "name": "Jacques Derrida",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/jacques-derrida.jpg",
    "content": "Jacques Derrida was a French philosopher, born in French Algeria on 15 July 1930. Well-recognized for introducing a semiotic analysis form which he called \u2018deconstruction\u2019, Derrida is one of the major philosophers concerning postmodern philosophy and post structuralism.\n\nThe year was 1967 when Derrida actually emerged as a philosopher of importance to the world. He published three of his important texts, Writing and Difference, Of Grammatology and Speech and Phenomena. Later he published The Postcard, Glas, Dissemination and The Gift of Death. In Of Grammatology, we see the beginnings of unique thoughts regarding deconstructions as he challenges the speech/writing opposition, a phenomenon which had greatly preoccupied Western Philosophy. Derrida also presented his political philosophy in the 90s, in works such as Force of law and Politics of Friendship. Politically, he focused on existing democracies, sovereignty, and the democracies to come.\n\nThe philosophy of deconstruction was developed by Derrida as a result of an influence from a number of great thinkers and philosophers, including Heidegger, Nietzsche, Freud and Saussure. As Derrida distanced himself from the existing French schools of thought in philosophy of the time (structuralism, phenomenology and existentialism), he presented the unique ideas under the name of deconstruction in the 1960s.\n\nDeconstruction is not entirely negative, but rather a critique of the traditional Western philosophy. It aims to analyze, and then undermine the myriad binary oppositions that dominate our thinking patterns.\n\nDeconstruction is bilateral; literary and philosophical. In its literary aspect, deconstruction aims at interpreting text, and invents where necessary to search for hidden alternative meanings. Philosophically, it aims at the \u2018metaphysics\u2019. Deriving from Heidegger, Derrida believed that metaphysics has influenced all of philosophy, starting from Plato. Metaphysics advantages one term of each opposition over the other, and deconstruction targets specifically this conventional way of thinking. It also says that some things can side with neither of the dichotomies. This idea of \u2018undecidability\u2019 is reflected in the later works of Derrida, as he applies it to the acts of hospitality, giving presents and doing favors, as such instances have both possible and impossible conditions. Therefore, gift-giving and hospitality remains undecided; it can be either possible or impossible.\n\nA visible shift from deconstruction to a focus of literature and emphasis on play of meaning and literary work is clearly evident in Derrida\u2019s later works. He also tackled many other issues, worth mentioning among which are Marxism (in Specters of Marx, the Work of Mourning and the New International) and psychoanalysis (in The Postcard (1980)).\u00a0 Aesthetics, ethics and legal issues were also dealt with in Derrida\u2019s essays.\u00a0 He also answered questions regarding Jews and Jewish tradition in his autobiography \u2018Circumfession\u2019 and in Shibboleth.\n\nAs deconstruction relates to both literature and philosophy, it has remained a highly influential topic in various fields, such as literary theory, culture studies, linguistics, sociology, anthropology, psychology and even feminism. As the inventor of deconstruction, Derrida has left behind a legacy of himself.\n\nCollectively, Derrida published forty books, hundreds of essays and various public presentations. He impacted with his thoughts the fields of historiography, linguistics, queer studies, psychoanalysis, sociolinguistics, political theory, architecture (as in deconstructivism), music and art. His works are also famous in countries where continental philosophy is of some influence, such as places in South America and Continental Europe, especially in debates that surround epistemology, ontology, ethics and hermeneutics. Jacques Derrida died in Paris on 9 October 2009."

    "name": "Jacques Lacan",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/jacques-lacan.jpg",
    "content": "Jacques Lacan was a renowned philosopher and an extremely controversial psycho-analyst, who ranked amongst the most notable academics of Parisian society during the 20th Century. His theories and research have immensely benefitted critical theory, French philosophy, sociology, feminist theory, literary theory, film theory and clinical psychoanalysis.\n\nJacques Lacan was born as Jacques Marie Emile Lacan on April 13, 1901, in Paris, France. Jacques belonged to a prosperous bourgeois family and was raised in a Catholic household. He was a brilliant student, and particularly excelled in philosophy and Latin. During the 1920s, he was enrolled in a medical school, where he studied psychoanalysis under the guidance of renowned psychiatrist Gaitan de Clerambault. Later, Jacques studied at the Faculte de Medecine de Parise, where he was introduced to diseases like automatism, a disease that leads a person to believe that his actions, thoughts, and speech are controlled by an external force. His interaction with such patients contributed to his learning.\n\nLacan became a member of the rapidly spreading psychoanalytical movement that had taken over France. In 1932, Lacan wrote his doctoral thesis, titled \u201cDe la psychose parano\u00efaque dans ses rapports avec la personnalit\u00e9\u201d, which dealt with the comparison and connections between psychoanalysis and psychiatric medication. This period of Lacan\u2019s life, marks the gradual evolution of his psychiatric principles, he moved away from conventional psychiatric practices towards inculcating Freud\u2019s psychoanalytical concepts, which eventually became his own psychological principle while diagnosing and treating. In 1936, Lacan formulated his theory of the \u201cMirror Stage\u201d, and he published several articles and papers explaining the significance and development of this subject. The mirror stages deals with the ability of a 6-18 months old infant to be able to recognize itself in the mirror before developing his motor or speech skills. The infant must be able to recognize its own image, as well as be able to differentiate its image from that of another\u2019s. The attainment of this ability marks the child\u2019s succession towards language skills, and the development of ego.\n\nLacan\u2019s renowned and remarkable lectures delivered in Rome in 1953, are published as \u201cThe Discourse of Rome\u201d, this work was adopted as the official manifesto of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise de psychanalytique (SFP), established by Lacan after breaking away with the International Psycho-Analytical Association (IPA). Lacan weekly seminars at the St. Anne\u2019s Church attracted great audiences, and contained imminent personalities that included prominent linguists, philosophers and thinkers such as Barthes, Foucault, Levi-Strauss, and Althusser. These lectures have also contributed to his major work, \u201cEcrits\u201d. \n\nIn 1953, Lacan devoted his time to the study of structural linguistics, and developing an understanding of Freud\u2019s theories. He believed that Freud, like him, agreed that human psychology is based on linguistics rather than a biological makeup. Lacan proposed that the unconscious is \u201cstructured like a language\u201d and \u201cgoverned by the order of the signifier\u201d. Lacan began translating Heidegger\u2019s work in to French, and Heidegger\u2019s theories had a significant impact on Lacan\u2019s perceptions, as displayed in his essay, titled \u201cThe Function and Field of Speech in Psychoanalysis\u201d, where he describes subjectivity as a symbolic constitution. Hegel also had a profound influence on Lacan\u2019s work.\n\nAlthough he was considered unconventional and unorthodox in his psychoanalytical treatments, Lacan was the first to introduce structural linguistics to psychoanalytical theory. His lectures provided analysis of his theories, and his case studies provided his theories in practice, thus all his work made it evident that language plays a vital role in the psychological development of human beings. According to Lacanian psychoanalysis, language is one of the Symbolic order, while the Imaginary and the Real form the other two. The Imaginary is the lack of reality and misinterpretation of nature, while the Real is comprehensive and understandable.\n\nDuring the 1960s and towards the early 70s, Lacan began to drive further away from traditional psychoanalysis and Freudian teachings, and developed his own school of thought, which became famous as the \u201cLacanian\u201d school of thought notable for his complex diagrams and neologisms. He proposed that the ego is the seat of neurosis, while the Symbolic order is the key place for subject formation. In 1963, Lacan established the Ecole Freudienne de Paris (EEP), devoted to continuing and reviving Freud\u2019s work by introducing new and innovative ideas to the original work. The training given at the Lacan\u2019s school was based on radically unconventional methods, and this led to increased conflict and tension between Lacan and the orthodox psychoanalytic community. In 1974, he accepted the position of the Scientific Director at the University of Paris, in Vincennes, along with heading the department of psychoanalysis. Under Lacan, the department strived to give psychoanalytical training a scientific element by inculcating logic and mathematics as well as strong emphasis on linguistics."

    "name": "Jean Baudrillard",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/jean-baudrillard.jpg",
    "content": "Jean Baudrillard was a post-structuralist and post-modernist philosopher, sociologist, cultural theorist, photographer and political commentator. He was born on\u00a0July 27, 1929 in the northern town of Reims. He was the first one to attend university in his family who went ahead to become a world-famous intellectual and a sociology professor.\n\nHeavily influenced by Marcel Mauss and Georges Bataille, Baudrillard was a thinker who reversed the thoughts of others to give an original analysis. Other influences on Baudrillard included the Surrealists, the Situationists, and authors such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Jean-Paul Sartre. Psychoanalysis and Sigmund Freud also had a key impact on Baudrillard\u2019s philosophy. The strongest influence on him remains that of Marxism. His thought developed through three crucial stages, starting from post-Marxism, passing through socio-linguistic and reaching to a techno-prophetic shift.\n\nJean Baudrillard\u2019s philosophy stands on the concepts of simulation and hyper-reality, which refers to the unrealistic nature of the modern culture. In today\u2019s world of mass communication and consumption, all of our feelings and emotions are simulated through unnatural means. We remain unaware of reality as we do not experience it first-hand, but rather view it through someone else\u2019s lens and point of view. For Baudrillard, reality in today\u2019s world is not what can be reproduced, but something which has already been reproduced. This is what he called \u2018hyper-real\u2019, anything which is fully simulated.\n\nIn his two post-Marxist books, The System of Objects (1968) and Consumer Society (1970), Baudrillard assesses the psychology behind mass consumption in the capitalist world of today. In the first publication, he says that consumers are lured into buying things by making things meaningful, and not useful. Senseless meanings and a metaphysical order is being attached to things which compels an individual to make a purchase to fit in in the crowd. The second book concurs that an individual becomes a consumer under the illusion that he is merely fulfilling his so-called needs which in actuality helps in running the productive system.\n\nIn his book In the Shadow of the Silent Majorities (1983), Baudrillard debates that the modern era has entered into a phase of disintegration and collapse. He says that the old class structure has vanished entirely, leaving behind a nothingness, an empty space between the masses; their translucent reality. The masses no longer have a distinct status of their own. The plethora of surveys and statistical exercises have rendered the masses incapable of being responsive to meaningful political representation. All religious, philosophical and political ideologies have been readily absorbed and neutralized by them. He further says that the law has generalized everything to such an extent that no specificity has been retained. The law imposed upon the masses is a collection of confusions, assigning sexual, political and religious labels to anything and everything.\n\nIn his famous travelogue America, Baudrillard gives a new method of learning about the culture of any place.\u00a0 He emphasizes on the unreality and shallowness of the American culture. This he concluded by speed travelling through the Sates. By this method, he aimed at not getting bogged down by the American society\u2019s \u2018depth\u2019. He compares America to a desert, where the cultural void is so great that the real and unreal mingle into a single indistinguishable perplexity. He does not aim at morally judging the American society, but rather studies it on a cultural level.\n\nJean Baudrillard passed away on March 6, 2007 in Paris, France. His assertions in sociology and philosophy continue to influence intellectual, the masses and the contemporary culture."

    "content": "Jean Jacques Rousseau was a highly influential writer, philosopher and composer, a thinker whose political philosophy created an impression upon the French Revolution. Born in Geneva on June 28, 1712, Rousseau is also credited with shaping the sociological, educational and cultural thought of the eighteenth century.\n\nRousseau is not only credited with politically revolutionizing France, he is also acclaimed for the change he brought in peoples\u2019 taste of music and other arts. He personally touched many lives through his ideas on education and how parents should take keen interest in their child\u2019s education and learning. For Rousseau, liberty was the foremost human right, and he worked greatly during his lifetime to make nations around the world realize the cruciality of this political aspiration.\n\nHe studied Hobbes\u2019s State of Nature and criticized him for his idea of wickedness among humans in an uncivilized society. Rousseau said that man as a salvage in a natural society without any political hierarchy is as good as an animal, which is neither good nor bad. He is at least self-sufficient and has no such vices as corruption, jealousy, and inequality like those when living in an unnatural society.\n\nHe never said that man in State of Nature is morally right. In fact he believed that morality and justice are concepts suitable only to a politicized society. Moral values can be cultivated only through rigorous education in a civil state. In State of Nature, man will only attempt to save himself and show no restraint, like an animal in the wild.\n\nIn his book, Discourse of Arts and Science, Rousseau debates that science and arts did not benefit man as they should have, because they were developed from human vanity and pride, and not from human needs. The comfort and pleasure they bring to men make them more indulgent and corrupt. Materialistic development only created divisions and animosity between men, and friendship was replaced with envy, sense of competition, threat and fear.\n\nIn Discourse of Inequality, Rousseau is pessimistic about the Social Contract theory of Hobbes and says that modern states emerged as a result of the desire of the stronger ones to rule over the weak population. The powerful contracted an exchange of liberties with provision of security. Modern states are institutions of inequality according to Rousseau.\n\nAt the end, he concludes with a suggestion on what could be done. He believes that men should now cultivate morality on their own and to completely submit to the higher authorities. By doing so threats between fellow men could be prevented as they all obey the higher law as long as no two men remain unequal before the law and that the higher authority is decided on the basis of the general will of the people.\n\nIn the field of education, Rousseau penned down Emile, also known as On Education. The book focuses and urges parents to take an interest in the knowledge and information gaining process of their children. Rousseau believed that educating one child is educating a person for entire civil citizenship.\n\nRousseau\u2019s diverse contributions to the society also include his composition of music. He wrote seven operas and also experimented with other forms of music as a theorist. He blended the Baroque style of music with the Classical to fashion music in new forms. His most famous musical work is arguably the opera Le devin du village.\n\nHe died\u00a0due to a hemorrhage on July 2, 1778 in France. Sixteen years later, he was given the title of a national hero at Panth\u00e9on in Paris. His ideas were adopted and embraced by Saint-Just and Robespierre after his death, and they flamed the fire of the French Revolution."

    "content": "Jean-Paul Charles Sartre was a writer, novelist, political activist, biographer, literary critic and philosopher. He was born on June\u00a021, 1905 in France and was a leading figure of 20th century philosophies of Marxism, existentialism and phenomenology.\n\nJean-Paul Sartre is perhaps the most well-known philosopher of the twentieth century. His philosophical contributions, literary criticism, creativity of thought, and an active political struggle in the latter part of his life gained him worldwide recognition. Also known as the Father of existentialism, Sartre\u2019s ideas added significantly to the intellectual circles following World War II.\n\nSartre\u2019s foremost philosophical contribution was that of existentialism. He started on with the development of classic phenomenology, but later diverged into the concepts of self, ethics and methods of developing ones\u2019 existence. This divergence of thought forms the base of Sartre\u2019s phenomenological existentialism. He aimed at understanding a person\u2019s existence first rather than delving into the secrets of the world. He also developed a self-actualizing philosophical account of what it meant to be a human.\n\nIn his masterpiece, Being and Nothingness, Sartre presents his ontology in which he explains the two types of realities behind our conscious experiences. One is the object of consciousness, the thing which exists in itself and is unrelated and independent. The other type is the consciousness itself; a phenomenon which is always in relation to something. The unique thing about consciousness is that it can always experience nothingness. This negative power of nothingness also works within the self.\n\nSartre proposed a theory on human freedom that us humans are denounced to be free. He supported this theory by debating that since us humans do not know about the essence and plan behind our existence, we are left fully free to make our own choices and act upon our will, therefore leaving us with no excuses.\n\nHe\u00a0also expressed the idea that individuality and originality are earned, and cannot be learned. For him, life experiences are more important than knowledge. It is the realization of death which makes humans fully aware of their lives and potentialities. Death for Sartre is when we stop living for ourselves and exist only for the world outside.\n\nPrior the World War II, Sartre believed in playing the role of an apolitical intellectual to contribute to the world. The horrors of the war opened his eyes to the harsh realities of the world, and he began playing an active political role in France. He formed a resistance group in Paris in 1941. In 1943, he joined a Writers\u2019 Resistance Group. Through his ferocious writing during that period, he aimed at developing a moral system.\n\nSartre was a supporter of the French Communist Party but after Hungary\u2019s invasion by the Soviet Union, he rejected PCF\u2019s claims of being the true representatives of the French masses. His support shifted to the Maoist movement in the late 1960s, which rejected the established Communist parties of the time. Later in life, Sartre liked to call himself an anarchist politically.\n\nSartre\u2019s literary works are a portrayal of his existentialist philosophy. His famous novels Nausea, No Exit, The Roads to Freedom trilogy are all well-known works of existentialist literature which earned him the Nobel Prize in 1964. However, he rejected the honor stating that an author should not be institutionalized.\n\nJean-Paul Sartre\u00a0died on April 15, 1980 in Paris. His works continue to influence critical theory, literary studies, sociology and post-colonial theory."

    "content": "Jeremy Bentham was a British philosopher, social reformer, jurist, and human rights activist. \u00a0Born on February 15, 1748, Bentham emerged as the founder of modern utilitarianism. He was a radical philosopher of law and politics, and gave ideas which were way ahead of his times.\n\nBentham\u2019s theories laid the foundation of welfarism. He is one of the most important theorists in Anglo-American philosophy of law. Being a true humanitarian, he stood for the right of economic liberty, individual freedom, abolition of slavery, equality of women, freedom of expression, sexual liberty for homosexuals, and even animal rights. He also advocated the abolishment of physical punishment for children.\n\nBentham struggled in his life to give shape to his dream of creating an entirely utilitarian law code. He based the underlying principle of his ideal code of law on the philosophy of happiness; anything which creates greater happiness will decide between right and wrong.\n\nThis principle of greatest happiness forms the cornerstone of Bentham\u2019s entire philosophy. By happiness he meant giving supremacy to pleasure over pain.\n\nTo test the amount of happiness, he classified between twelve kinds of pains and fourteen types of pleasures. This hedonistic theory of Bentham\u2019s is often criticized for the utter disregard and ignorance towards the principle of justice and fairness.\n\nHis book, An Introduction to Principles of Morals and Legislations presents his theories focusing on the principle of utility. According to Bentham, good is anything which causes least pain and greatest pleasure, and evil is what is most painful and least pleasurable. By these two feelings, he does not only mean physical but as well as spiritual kinds of pains and pleasures.\n\nHe also devised a criterion for the measurement of pains and pleasures; the criteria involved duration, intensity, proximity and certainty of the feeling among other factors.\n\nBentham advised the legislators not to create laws so unnecessarily strict that they may create more evil in society. The punishment for a crime should not be such that it may lead to more dangerous crimes and offenses, and thus to greater pain than pleasure in the society as a whole.\n\nBentham also gave economic principles leading to individual freedom. His work is considered to be one of the first attempts at a modern welfare economic system.\n\nFor Bentham, women rights were of utmost importance. In fact, he said that he chose to be a reformer only because of the grave indiscrimination against women he saw around him. He propagated complete equality between the two genders.\n\nBentham did not only stood for human rights, but he also took a stand for cruelty against animals. For him, presence of an intellect is not the criteria for fulfilling rights. Rather, the ability to suffer should be the benchmark when differentiating between acceptable and unacceptable treatment of a living being.\n\nAs a jurist, Bentham was the first person to have used the term \u2018codify\u2019. He strived for the codification of the common law in a proper, written set of statutes. He was the first advocate of codification of law in the United States and England.\n\nEven though he wrote extensively on a myriad of topics in his lifetime, Bentham did not bring them to completion or before the public, except on rare occasions. His posthumous collection of writings reached to an estimated 30 million words, most of which is held by the UCL\u2019s Special Collections.\n\nJeremy Bentham passed away on June 6, 1832. The world remembers him as an advocate of rights for all living beings, and the upholder of law and morality in grave times."

    "content": "Jiddu Krishnamurti was a spiritual writer, speaker and philosopher from India. Born on May 12, 1895, Krishnamurti wrote and spoke extensively on nature of knowledge and mind, human relations, change, psychological revolution and meditation.\n\nHis inspiration in philosophy comes as result of a fateful meeting with a prominent theosophist Charles Webster Leadbeater at the Theosophical Society headquarters in Madras. Subsequently, Leadbeater and Annie Besant provided him with guidance and saw in him a potential World Teacher. He rejected the idea and disbanded the Order of the Star of the East in 1929, an institution meant to support the idea. For him truth could be attained in any way, through any means.\n\nFor him, philosophy wasn\u2019t a debate of ideas, beliefs and notions but the affection and selfless love for gaining knowledge which is unbiased and true in nature. Philosophy, according to Krishnamurti, is a firm grasp on the truths of life, such truths which are beyond our preconceived thoughts and notions about life. He believed that philosophy is not limited to debates and speculations, but the ultimate aim of philosophy is the quest of what is true. He distinguishes between truth and reality and says that truth cannot be attained through the path of reality. Reality is limited by our thoughts, while truth remains complete and unaffected.\n\nThe crux of Jiddu Krishnamurti\u2019s teachings lies in his definition of truth being a pathless territory. For him, truth can be reached without the assistance of religious institutions, political leaders and any sort of moral policing. Truth is present not in the past or the future, but it is here and now. He believed that if an institution is set up for the purpose of attainment of truth, it may cripple the person seeking truth and prove fruitless in the long run. It blocks the growth of a person which results when he discovers things for himself and forms his own opinions.\n\nObserving phenomena critically, without biases and thoughts of past experiences is, according to Krishnamurti, the most direct way to reach and understand truth. \u2018Choicelessly\u2019 scrutinizing events, minus remembrance, recognition and recollection, free from opinions, motives and prejudice is the only way forward towards the truth.\n\nIn his book The Only Revolution, Krishnamurti stresses on the idea that change in society results solely from changes in ones\u2019 mind. Society and individuals are connected through minds and the thoughts they contain. To bring about a change in any society, a revolution of the mind is necessary. Social change cannot be brought about by changing the existing political system or the government; neither is it affected by acts of charity and goodness. Only the will of the mind will change an individual, which will lead to greater diversity and progress overall.\n\nKrishnamurti also worked considerably in the field of education. He founded a number of schools around the world, which include the international education centre, Brockwood Park School. He emphasized on a holistic approach towards spreading education; sects, castes, ethnicities and religious backgrounds play no role in the working of any of his institutions.\n\nHe along with Annie Besant established the\u00a0Krishnamurti Foundation\u00a0in the 1920s which works towards the cause of education in India and abroad. Many schools around the world have\u00a0being set up and supported through this foundation and Krishnamurti\u2019s supporters.\n\nJiddu Krishnamurti died on February 17, 1986. His teachings, sayings and lectures play a vital role in guiding humanity towards the attainment of truth and have helped individuals think above prejudices and biases."

    "content": "John Dewey, born on October 20, 1859, was a renowned American philosopher, social reformer, educationist and psychologist. He was the founding father of the Pragmatist school of philosophy. His ideas also laid the foundation of functional psychology and education movement in America.\n\nHe received his graduate degree\u00a0from University of Vermont and did doctorate in philosophy from John Hopkins University. Later, he\u00a0joined the University of Michigan as a professor of philosophy and psychology. He also published his books Psychology in 1887, and Leibniz\u2019s New Essays Concerning Human Understanding in 1888. Through these books, he tried to bridge the gap between experimental sciences and idealism and expressed his theories on neo-Hegelism.\n\nDewey\u2019s interests shifted from Hegel\u2019s ideas to a new kind of experimental psychology which was being developed by G. Stanley Hall\u00a0and William James at the time. He delved into the new field, extensively studied child psychology and came up with original theories concerning the philosophy of education that would help children in surviving the ever-changing modern democratic world.\n\nHe then left for Chicago in 1904, where he penned down his most recognized work, Experience and Nature, which contained his philosophy underlying the importance of leading a democratic life. This theme is also evident in all of his later writings concerning the fields of politics, religion and aesthetics.\n\nIn the realm of psychology, Dewey also took great interest in psychology of visual perception. He himself was a troubled listener and was tone deaf.\n\nHis philosophy was mainly related to pragmatism, although he liked to be called an instrumentalist rather than a pragmatist.\u00a0 He believed that all objects change and that nothing is static. He deemed experience not as an entirely subjective thing, but regarded it as a collection of human perceptions and worldly events coming together.\n\nFor the determination of truth, Dewey said that all kinds of experimentation can be utilized as an approximate arbiter. For the distinction between good and bad, Dewey stated that no static belief and concept of a personal God can determine virtue from evil. Scientific methods alone can be depended upon for achieving greater good.\n\nDewey championed democracy in all spheres of life, from philosophy to education to journalism and communication.\u00a0 For him, democracy is the \u2018ultimate ethical ideal\u2019. He discussed social reforms and democracy in his educational writings and stated that education isn\u2019t merely a tool for gaining knowledge, but also how to live to apply that knowledge.\n\nDewey\u2019s books on education include The Child and Curriculum, Democracy and Education, The School and Society, and Experience and Education among various others. He deemed school as a social institution through which social reforms can take place effectively. He also strongly believed that all children should be given ample opportunities to contribute in the learning process.\u00a0 Students should be made aware of their capabilities and how to make use of their potential for the collective good of the society, as per Dewey.\n\nTo practically apply his ideals of education, John Dewey along with his wife started an experimental school of primary education at the University of Chicago in 1894. Later in 1919, he founded the New School for Social Research which focused on a free flow of intellectual and artistic ideas among its students.\n\nJohn Dewey died on June 1, 1952 at the age of 92 in New York City. Over the course of his lifetime, Dewey produced more than a thousand pieces\u00a0on education, democracy, functional psychology and aesthetics."

    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/john-hick.jpg",
    "content": "John Hick, one of\u00a020th century most influential religious philosophers,\u00a0was born on January 20, 1922, in Scarborough, England. His family owned a prosperous shipping business, and his parents, Mark and Aileen Hick gave equal importance to both entrepreneurship and education. Young John was an avid reader, and encouraged by his uncle, Edward Hirst who was a retired Professor and author of several books on Christian ethics, Hick devoured the works of Nietzsche, Mill, Whitehead, Freud, Leibniz, Schopenhauer, Kant, the empiricists and several other philosophers by the age of 17.\n\nFollowing his uncle\u2019s advice, Hick enrolled at the Hull University and began to study law. Prior to the WWII, John had a very diversified and holistic perception of religion which had been influenced by the divinity theories presented by spiritualists, pentecostalists and theosophists. However, influenced by the bombings of WWII and the revolutionary activity around him, Hick experienced a religious transformation which he himself explains in his autobiography as \u201ca powerful evangelical conversion to fundamentalist Christianity\u201d. Hick adopted the fundamentalist belief of Protestantism, and decided to begin training for the ministry.\n\nIn 1941, he joined the University of Edinburgh to pursue religious studies. His education was interrupted a year later, when he received his call to military service. Hick was strongly against the notion of war and he refused to fight, therefore, he joined the Friends Ambulance Unit. Working for the FAU, Hick\u2019s task was to provide medical services to the allied soldiers, distribute aid to civilians and other non-violent services to the allied forces. In 1945, he resumed his education at the University of Edinburgh. There he came in contact with the religious theories of Kant through Professor Kemp Smith, who was notable translator of Kant\u2019s work. Upon discovering Kant, Hick began turning away from fundamentalism and found his religious calling in the conservation notions of Evangelicalism. In 1948, he attended Oxford, where he received his PhD with a dissertation that became famous as \u2018Faith and Knowledge\u2019 upon being published in 1957.\n\nJohn Hick\u2019s quest for religious understanding was not yet finished, soon he began drifting away from conservative religious ideologies. After receiving his doctorate, he joined Cambridge to train as a priest. He received his ordainment and got married shortly after. He began working as a parish priest in Northumberland, but he left this profession upon accepting a position at Cornell University and moved to America. He left Cornell soon after, and taught for a while at the Princeton Theological Seminary. His religious theories became increasingly liberal and he completely abandoned the Evangelical school of thought. The Americans began accusing him of heresy upon his refusal to acknowledge the virgin birth. Hick found it hard to bear the severe criticism that was directed at his work and decided to return to England upon receiving an offer to teach at Cambridge in 1963. He spent the next three years at Cambridge, during this time he wrote his most influential book \u2018Evil and the God of Love\u2019.\n\nIn 1967, he accepted the appointment to the H. G. Wood Chair of Philosophy at Birmingham University. At Birmingham University, Hick advocated against the policy that required students to study the doctrines of the Church of England regardless of their religious backgrounds. He is a strong advocate of ecumenism and interfaith dialogue. He later joined as professor of the Philosophy of Religion, Emeritus, at the Claremont Graduate University in Southern California.\n\nHick made several notable contributions to the field of religious philosophy. His work revolves around the evolution of his religious beliefs and the development of his pluralism. His belief in a loving and endearing God has led to his theory that such a God is highly unlikely to condemn non-Christians to hell. Similarly, Hick questions various fundamental and traditional Christian beliefs about Jesus and God. In 1973, his book \u2018God and the Universe\u2019 came out, in which he put forward the notion that all the religions in the world are actually just different interpretations of the same concept of divine reality. In 1977, he edited and published \u2018The Myth of God Incarnate\u2019 that questioned the traditional theories of the incarnation. Other influential books by Hick include Death and Eternal Life, An Interpretation of Religion Arguments for the Existence of God, God Has Many Names, The Metaphor of God Incarnate, A Christian Theology of Religions, The New Frontier of Religion and Science, and Philosophy of Religion.\n\nJohn Hick died, aged 90, on February 9, 2012 in Birmingham, England."

    "content": "The Father of Liberalism, John Locke was one of the most significant Enlightenment thinkers as well as a physician and philosopher. He was amongst the first British empiricists and a major figure of the social contract theory. Casting a profound influence on the development of epistemology and political philosophy, John Locke\u2019s influence is evident in the works of numerous Enlightenment thinkers including Voltaire and Rousseau. The American Declaration of Independence also displays contributions of Locke\u2019s works to classical republicanism and liberal theory. John Locke is widely known to pioneer the concepts of identity, self and consciousness. He believed the human mind to be a clean slate, born without pre-existing ideas and that knowledge came with experience.\n\nJohn Locke was born to Puritan parents on August 29, 1632 in Wrington, Somerset. He grew up in Pensford, Belluton where the family moved soon after Locke\u2019s birth. In 1647, Locke was sent to London to study in the prestigious Westminister School. After the completion of his schooling, Locke entered Christ Church, Oxford. During the course of studies, Locke was always more interested in modern philosophies and works rather than the classics taught at university. Locke developed a keen interest in medicine and after obtaining his bachelors and masters degrees in 1656 and 1658 respectively, Locke obtained another bachelors of medicine degree in 1674. He worked extensively with renowned names such as Robert Boyle, Richard Lower and Thomas Willis. In 1666, Locke met Lord Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, who was visiting Oxford to seek treatment for his failing liver. Impressed by Locke\u2019s intelligence, Shaftesbury requested Locke to join his team of attendants. \n\nIn 1667, Locke moved to the Shaftesbury house where he served as a personal physician to Ashley Cooper while pursuing his medical studies. Cooper credited Locke with saving his life after Locke had suggested a surgery for Cooper\u2019s liver cyst. Under Shaftesbury\u2019s influence, Locke became involved in politics. He became Secretary of the Board of Trade and Plantations and also served as Secretary to the Lords and Proprietors of the Carolinas. After Shaftesbury\u2019s fall in 1675, Locke travelled to France for some time. He came back to England in 1679. During this time, Locke composed the Two Treatises of Government. In 1683 Locke was suspected of involvement in the Rye House Plot due to which he fled to the Netherlands. He used the free time in Netherlands to resume writing. He spent an ample amount of time writing new works and rewriting and revising older works. Most of his work was published upon his return from exile after the Glorious Revolution. \n\nSome of John Locke\u2019s significant works include A Letter Concerning Toleration (1689), A Second Letter Concerning Toleration (1690), A Third Letter for Toleration (1692), Two Treatises of Government (1689), An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690), Some Thoughts Concerning Education (1693), The Reasonableness of Christianity, as Delivered in the Scriptures (1695) and A Vindication of the Reasonableness of Christianity (1695). Some other major works left unpublished or published posthumously include First Tract of Government (1660), Second Tract of Government (1662), Questions Concerning the Law of Nature (1664), Essay Concerning Toleration (1667), Of the Conduct of the Understanding (1706), and A paraphrase and notes on the Epistles of St. Paul to the Galatians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Romans, Ephesians (1707).\n\nJohn Locke passed away on October 28, 1704. He is buried in the churchyard of the village of High Laver, east of Harlow in Essex. Locke never got married and did not have any children."

    "content": "John Searle is an American philosopher of the contemporary times, recognized for his theories of speech acts and consciousness. His work on philosophy deals with language, the mind and social institutions, as he attempts at showing human experiences as a distinct image in the social universe, where they take place.\n\nSearle\u2019s interest in the philosophy of language is not merely based on the function of the language as a tool for communication, but because of the depth languages hold in themselves. His first work Speech Acts was an extension of works of his colleagues, J.L Austin, Ludwig Wittgenstein and G. C. J. Midgle.\n\nSearle believes that the basic unit of any language is a speech act, called the illocutionary act. This act works as a communicative symbol in the context of the utterance. His work focused mostly on illocutionary acts performed by the speaker, among which the act of promising was his main concern. He defined a set of rules that marks the necessary conditions for performing a speech act.\n\nFor instance, the rules of promising include that the speaker intends to carry out a future act, that the listener also wants the act to be carried out by the speaker, that both of them\u00a0agree that the speaker will carry out the act under normal circumstances, and that now the speaker is under an obligation to the listener in terms of carrying out the act.\n\nHe also held the belief that an utterance is left bereft of any meaning when the context in which it was delivered is unknown. Sentences without context do not express propositions, instead illocutionary acts (communicative tokens) and contextual sentences fulfill the purpose of giving meaning to an utterance.\n\nHis focus on speech and language drove Searle to the philosophy of mind, where speech develops. In Philosophy of Mind, he discusses the nature of our intentions behind conscious actions.\n\nHe defines intentionality as the mind\u2019s ability to take a stand for and correspond to happenings around us. Our thoughts are structural and intentional in the sense that they are in regard to something. On the other hand, some mental states like pain, anger, happiness and anxiety are not intentional. But, the speech acts used to express these mental states are intentional. It is this derived intentionality of tongue which explains how our words and expressions do not only cover worldly, physical things but also unreal fantasies and fiction.\n\nSearle argues that modern philosophy has denied the presence of consciousness. In Intentionality and in The Rediscovery of the Mind he presents several alternative theories of consciousness. He states that consciousness is a metaphysical experience caused by physical processes in our brains.\n\nChinese Room Philosophy:\n\nThe Chinese Room philosophy is Searle\u2019s argument against the notion that when physical processes of our brain are reproduced artificially, it creates a conscious being (artificial intelligence). Imagine you are in a room where there is a book and some paper. A person from outside slides into the room some Chinese characters, which you translate from the book, compute a response from the book and slide it outside, which gives an impression that you are familiar with Chinese, while in reality you are not. Thus translating English into Chinese does not mean you understand it too. Searle disputes that feeding data into a computer does not make it intelligent; the computer merely processes it.\n\nSocial Philosophy:\n\nSearle probes into collective intentionality as he delves into the world of social philosophy. A person can not aim to perform an act collectively as a group if he doesn\u2019t intend to play his part. The we-intention is not a collection of many I-intentions; they are creators of our social institwas utions.\n\nJohn Searle has received several\u00a0awards\u00a0for his work including\u00a0the Jean Nicod Prize (2000), the National Humanities Medal (2004) and the Mind and Brain Prize (2006)."

    "content": "\u2018The most influential English-speaking philosopher of the nineteenth century\u2019, John Stuart Mill, was a renowned philosopher, political economist and a civil servant in the East India company. He worked a great deal on morality, logic, philosophy, politics, economy and social issues such as women rights and slavery.\n\nBorn in London, Mill was educated exceptionally under the watchful gaze of his father. He learnt both Latin and Greek by the age of four, and by 16 he had become a well-trained logician and an economist. At the age of 20, Mill diverted his attention from science, logic and rationality to the aesthetics of poetry and literature. This diversified his fields of study and he persuaded the British society to focus on social, political and economical issues using both scientific knowledge and literary insights.\n\nA Radical Empiricist:\n\nAt heart and in his mind resided empiricist views: experience is the mother of all knowledge and nothing can be conceived in the mind when it has not been observed by the senses. In A System of Logic, (1843), Mill presents the explanation of reasoning and logic and how our experiences affect our thinking capabilities.\n\nHe argues that worldly phenomena can be best explained through the sciences of nature. Our society and all its problems can be tackled through logic, rationality and knowledge gained from experience. He directly attacked the philosophy of intuition throughout System of Logic, a theory followed by William Whewell and Sir William Hamilton. They held the belief that truth and knowledge is gained not by causal laws and observation but by unmediated, divine awareness.\n\n\u00a0Utilitarianism and Happiness\n\nIn his book Utilitarianism (1861), Mill gave a moral principle regarding pursuit of happiness. This principle aims to provide a decisive factor regarding right and wrong. Mill said that all those actions are right which produce happiness, not only for the doer of the action but also the people around him, and all those actions are wrong which propagates unhappiness among the people. This principle is also known as the \u2018greatest-happiness principle\u2019.\n\nMill further contributed to utilitarianism by his argument of qualitative happiness. He said that not all kinds of happiness are equal; higher pleasures constitute moral and intellectual happiness while physical pleasures are deemed lower pleasures by Mill. He also differentiates between satiation and happiness and wittingly puts it in the following statement:\u00a0\u201cIt is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied\u201d.\n\nMill\u2019s Philosophy of Political Economy:\n\nTo the masses, Mill was the renowned author of Principles of Political Economy (1848). In his publication Mill reflects on what the numbers say in an economy and what the public actually wants and appreciates. He held the idea that industrial and economical growth should be given up for the betterment of the environment. He also was a strong advocate of population control in favor of equal provision resources to all human beings.\n\nMill states his ideas of freedom and state intervention in On Liberty (1859) and goes on to say that a state should only interfere with the citizens\u2019 conduct if it is to prevent a greater harm to the public. He was also a champion of human rights and his feminist ideas are put eloquently in The Subjection of Women (1869). All in all, John Stuart Mill\u2019s life and works serve as a role model for tackling human adversaries in an enlightened manner, utilizing both science and arts."

    "content": "Born on October 5, 1703, Jonathan Edwards grew up to become a widely acknowledged religious preacher, philosopher and theologian. Classified as one of America\u2019s major intellectuals, Edward worked on a broad range of original religious concepts.\n\nTruly inspired by Locke\u2019s philosophy and Newton\u2019s scientific discoveries, Edward applied his intellect to reinvent and rejuvenate man\u2019s relation with God in a way that the experience brings God\u2019s divine blessings to His men. In his attempt at bridging the gap between man and God, Edward helped significantly in the development of American Puritanism, a concept of the 16th and 17th century which attempted to purify the institution of church from \u2018popery\u2019 of the Roman Catholic times.\n\nThe entire content of Edward\u2019s works aims to propagate two basic concepts. First, God is the all-supreme and the all-sovereign. Second, the world is a manifestation of God\u2019s beauty. He believed that ultimate reality is mystical and godly, further strengthened by his statement that this \u2018world is an ideal one\u2019. His works focused mainly on the metaphysical concepts of theological determinism. Moreover, Edward played a vital role in the religious movement of The First Great Awakening.\n\nEdward wrote\u00a0in detail to defend theological determinism in Freedom of the Will. He discussed the concept of free will and full freedom of choice and deemed it incoherent and unintelligible. He questioned libertarian concepts of self-determination that whether the act of choosing is led by a first act of will or is it based on causal reasons.\n\nHe stated that our acts of choosing are neither selected by us nor are they based on a motive. Thus it is not in human hands to decide his will for himself and humans cannot be held responsible for their actions.\n\nThe principle reason behind supporting theological determinism was his staunch belief in God\u2019s sovereignty, the necessary knowledge of the reasons behind the creation of everything and God\u2019s awareness of future events.\n\nAs George Whitefield arrived in America, he brought with himself the revolutionary Great Awakening. Newly converts ruled the Colonies, and Revivals influenced thousands of people through the intensity of their feelings. This was opposed by the ministers who attacked the Revivals. They blamed Whitefield, Edwards and various other preachers of fanning the flames of religious extremism.\n\nEdwards was aware of the great outpour of emotions by the Converts, but he fully defended their cause as he thought it was a gush of divine blessings and grace. In several of his books, he protected the cause, among which are the Distinguishing Marks of a Work of the Spirit of God (1741), Some Thoughts Concerning the Present Revival of Religion in New England (1742), and A Treatise Concerning Religious Affections (1746). Edward\u2019s hopes of a Christian Kingdom were restored by the Great Awakening.\n\nEdward\u2019s sermon \u201cSinners in the Hands of an Angry God\u201d was the cause of much reverence and respect from his followers and ordinary Christians. His works like The Life of David Brainerd, Religious Affections and The End for Which God Created the World continue to move and motivate millions of missionaries till date.\n\nJonathan Edwards passed away at the age of 55, leaving behind an influential work incomplete. Yet his philosophy has had a profound effect on the religious atmosphere of America, and has earned him the respect as the greatest of American theologians."

    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/judith-butler.jpg",
    "content": "Currently a professor of Comparative Literature and Rhetoric at University of California, Judith Butler is a well-known philosopher, presenting theories on gender, identity and power. Described as the \u2018superstar\u2019 of the \u201890s alternative culture academics, her ideas have created an impact on both society and politics.\n\nButler\u2019s philosophy revolves around identity and queer theory. Queer theory suggests that a person cannot be identified on the basis of any one characteristic, such as gender. Each person has various elements to their personality which form his/her unique identity, thus referring generally to all \u2018women\u2019 or any other group is insignificant as each woman or member of that group is different from the next in all aspects.\n\nBy Butler\u2019s perspective, the problem of gender inequality lies in the definition of a \u2018woman\u2019. Historically, women have been used as subjects to be symbolized politically. Butler disagrees by saying that all women cannot be identified as a homogenous, equal group since all women vary in their habits, situations and attitudes.\n\nAccording to Butler, the labeling of women as a group, away from men is in fact harmful to the feminists\u2019 cause. She states that if we suppose that men and women are different from each other then true equality can never be achieved. In this manner, Butler\u2019s stance is different from feminists who call attention to the separation of the sexes. She also believes that holding men as enemies of women aggravates the sexual inequality rather than helping the agenda.\n\nGender Trouble (1990), Butler\u2019s most powerful work, holds her ideas that the binary division of the sexes is a grave mistake. Instead of opening new potential for an individual to identify the self as a person and perform accordingly, it constricts them forcefully into two definite groups of men and women, thereby limiting the formation of an individual identity.\n\nFreud says that sex and gender can only be related in two ways; sex (being a male or female) causes gender (masculine or feminine) which results in desire of the opposite sex. Homosexuality is explained by Freud by stating that a woman recognizes herself as a man when she desires another woman. Butler advances towards the issue in a different manner. She believes that our gender is not an integral part of our identity, but more of an act which individuals put up to cope with varying circumstances.\n\nButler rejects the fact that gender is attained by destiny alone. This would leave no room for escape from the gender roles set by society throughout history. She insists on considering gender as variable, something more flexible which can be alternated as the situation requires in shifting contexts and times. This way we can achieve a new kind of equality between the two sexes, where people are free to behave as they wish. Consequently, gender is not who you are, rather it is what you do; it is similar to a dramatic performance.\n\nButler has also remained a political activist throughout her career, focusing on feminism, queer and gender-related issues. She has served as the chair of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission board. She has spoken\u00a0a great deal on the war atrocities, particularly in Iraq, Afghanistan and Palestine. She is an executive member of the Faculty for Israeli-Palestinian Peace in the United States. Butler also supported the Boycott movement against Israel.\n\nConsidered by the majority as one of the most influential political voices in the contemporary times, Judith Butler is the recipient of several awards, such as the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation\u2019s Distinguished Achievement Award (2008), a Fulbright-Hays Scholarship (1978) and the Brudner Memorial Prize for Lifetime Achievement for contributions to Lesbian and Gay Studies from Yale University (2004)."

    "content": "Julia Kristeva, born on June 24, 1941 in Bulgaria, is a structuralist philosopher, sociologist, psychoanalyst and literary critic famous for her semiotic theories. She left for France at the age of 23 and has lived there ever since. She is also an ardent feminist and a novelist.\n\nInfluenced by Roland Barthes and Lucian Goldmann, she pursued her original interests in the field of linguistics. She extensively studied both the Freudian and Lacanian methods of psychoanalysis, and contributed to the world as both an academician and analyst.\n\nShe remained one of the first structuralist at a time when structuralism was making its way in the field of Humanities. Her works also consists of original post-structuralist ideas. Her many books and essays present ideas on a wide range of subjects, ranging from art and art history, to semiotics in the field of linguistics and literary theory, political and social commentary and psychoanalysis.\n\nKristeva\u2019s writings can be distinguished by two main trends; early on she was under the influence of a semiotic-structuralist set of ideas and later entered a feminist-psychoanalyst phase. Her theories have been extracted from thinkers as diverse as Jacques Lacan, Michael Foucalt and Mikhail Bakhtin.\n\nDuring her second phase of thought, she presented a new concept which she named \u2018semianalysis\u2019; a combination of the study of signs (semiotics) and psychoanalysis methods of Sigmund Freud. She also marked a clear distinction between semiotics and the symbolics of a language, which is perhaps her most important contribution to the field of linguistics and philosophy of language. Semiotics is associated with the maternal body, and corresponds to the tone and rhythm, whereas symbolic is what we may term as the syntax and rules of grammar of a language.\n\nIn 1982, through the publication of Powers of Horror, she explained the pre-mirror developmental stage of a child\u2019s entry into Jacques Lacan\u2019s Law of father and the experience of maternal rejection. She maintains the judgment of oscillation of the semiotic and the symbolic identity in her later works, such as in the Revolution in Poetic Language. In the late 80s she produced some of her works based on narcissism, like the Tales of Love and Black Sun, which contained excerpts from her practice as an analyst earlier. In 1989 and 1990, Strangers to Ourselves and Lettre ouverte \u00fd Harlem D\u00e9sir were published respectively. These works focus primarily on difference and diversity \u00a0within identity.\n\nKristeva compared the two social sciences of anthropology and psychology, and concluded that they connect the social with the subject. The two fields are not each others\u2019 representatives; rather they serve to save the group and the subject.\n\nIn her distinction between the two fields, she also reflected that our societies are also constructed in the same way in which a person abandons the seemingly worthless mother in search of his identity. By this she means that our cultures are losing its feminine and maternal traits to emerge into a being.\n\nShe is also held in high regard as a key French feminist, and her name is taken with the likes of Simone de Beauvoir and Luce Irigaray, She has impacted the feminist movements worldwide, specifically in the UK and the US.\n\nThe French government, in recognition of Julia Kristeva\u2019s philosophical and literary contributions to their culture awarded her with the Order of Arts and Letters in 1990."

    "content": "J\u00fcrgen Habermas is a German philosopher, who presented notable theories on sociology, religion, communication studies, epistemology, language and political-legal thought. He stands as a prominent intellectual in Germany; public polls worldwide recognize his expertise in the field of philosophy, specifically in the realm of communicative rationality and the rule of law in politics.\n\nHabermas worked extensively on foundational theories of society and epistemology, during his association with the Frankfurt School, a school related to neo-Marxist social theory. His work deals with analysis of rule of law in modern politics, especially that of Germany. Habermasian theory is devoted to rationality and its relation with communication. His renowned work includes the notion of morality in relation to rationalization theory, which was first presented by Max Weber.\n\nHabermas\u2019 greatest contribution to the field of philosophy is his advancement in the rationality theory. According to Habermas, the greatest use of human rationality is not merely its ability to achieve a certain goal. He believes in the possibility for building a community through communicative procedures, a community which works for harmony among themselves and other- this is the best possible utilization of rationality according to Habermas\u2019s point of view. He therefore focused on achieving an \u2018ideal speech situation\u2019, so that the masses can voice their concerns and seek solution for their problems based solely on rationality.\n\nIn the domain of communicative rationality, a theory which holds human rationality as a vital result achieved through a process of successful communication, Habermas stressed on the fact that all humans are intuitively capable of reaching to mutually agreed conclusions through speech, and we should thus strive to change this inherent know-how into crystal clear knowledge, on how to conduct ourselves ethically in the field of practical rationality.\n\nHabermas considers the development of communicative rationality as his biggest achievement, and differentiates it from the rationalists\u2019 point of view by locating rationality in spoken communication processes, rather than in the cosmos. This theory helps in the social liberation of humans, while providing to us an adequate moral framework simultaneously. According to this social structure, all speech acts contain natural telos (Greek, meaning \u2018end\u2019) which constitutes the goal of shared understanding. Habermas built this framework through making use of social and moral theories from prominent philosophers, from Ludwig Wittgenstein, John Searle, Jean Piaget and some of his Frankfurt colleagues such as Karl-Otto Apel.\n\nThis theory of communicative action was practically utilized by Habermas in law and politics, where he suggested a kind of democracy where the constitution and law is open to public discussion and suggestion. Habermas was of the belief that through this form of democracy, people will be aware of their interests in self-governance, and would become even more responsible, thus adhering only to factual and logical debates. This would give the world political situation a more humane, free and classless environment, where the potential of human intellect is fully recognized and put to good use.\n\nHabermas\u2019 Towards Reconstructing Historical Materialism holds his views on Marxism. He held the belief that Marx\u2019s evaluation of the human evolutionary processes as merely an economic development is an extremely limited definition, which leaves out any room for human liberty. Marx deemed progress of human societies as linear and sequential, while Habermas debates that human progress is random, dynamic and multi-dimensional.\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas also remained a revered mentor and teacher for several. He taught philosophy at University of Heidelberg and chaired the department of philosophy and sociology at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt. He was also the recipient of the highest German honor award, the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the German Research Foundation (DFG)."

    "content": "Karl Barth was a Swiss theologian. Born on May 10, 1886, his ideas on God and Christianity have earned him the honor of being regarded as the greatest Protestant theologian belonging to the twentieth century.\n\nStarting off as a pastor, he rejected both the extremities of liberal theology specific to the 19th century Protestant Church and the more orthodox teachings of Christianity. Instead, he opted for creating a new path, which was called the dialectical theology in its initial stages due to the paradoxical relationship between God and His men; His love and wrath, reward and punishment on men. Barth was also called the father of neo orthodoxy, but he rejected the title. His work has\u00a0influenced many a significant people, such as Jacques Ellul and Thomas Torrance, the leaders in the Confessing Church.\n\nBarth\u2019s teaching emphasized mainly on the oneness and omnipotence of God. His reinterpretation of doctrine of election, his concept of sinfulness of mankind and the qualitative differences between man and God all led to focus of God\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nIn his first major work, Epistle to the Romans published in 1919, Barth gained a position as a noteworthy theologian with his sole focus on the sheer grace of God and his power. He had a light, humorous writing style, full of brilliant similes and unique phrases.\n\nThe most important contribution of Barth to Christianity, his magnum opus, is undoubtedly the thirteen-volume Church Dogmatic. The publication is regarded as the most crucial works on theology of the century. The book addresses four key doctrines: God, His creation, Revelation and Reconciliation.\n\nHe was of strong belief that human intellect and intuition alone cannot discover God in its entirety. For that purpose, God has provided mankind with His revelation, the Bible, which is important when one wants to reach Him. He also worked to bring back in Christianity the doctrine of Trinity, which was somewhat lost when Liberalism took over the Church.\n\nBarth\u2019s take on sin, salvation and punishment was contrary to the previous Calvinist thinking, which led Christians to believe that all sinners and rejecters of God will be eternally damned and punished by Him. Barth regarded salvation in pure Christological terms, believing that through Jesus Christ, all men have been justified and reconciled. He firmly asserted that all Christians should have faith in His eternal grace and that eternal salvation is a possibility not only for Christians but also for those who outright reject God.\n\nBarth played an active role in writing the Barmen Declaration, a document rejecting the Nazi\u2019s influence on the German Church. He wrote that church should be in allegiance to God alone, and worldly gods such as Fuhrer should not intervene in the matter of religion. The Barmen declaration was one of the founding texts forming the basis of the Confessing Church, of which Barth was later elected a leader.\n\nHe also refused to take an oath under Hitler. This cost him his professorship at the University of Bonn.\n\nIn 1962, Barth\u2019s authority as an influential religious leader was further recognized after\u00a0being featured on the cover of April\u2019s Time magazine. Karl Barth breathed his last on December 10, 1968. He had\u00a0a major impact on the mainstream American culture of religion and Christian ethics and morality."

    "content": "Karl Jaspers was a German intellectual, who began his career from psychiatry, which he later changed into psychology, before finally succumbing to philosophy and theology, in the beginning of the 1920s.\n\nFor him, the path which led to philosophy passed through the logical realm of science; his works cannot be fully understood without first recognizing him as a renowned psychiatrist and psychologist.\n\nJaspers\u2019 philosophy dealt with the concepts of existentialism, a theory according to which all philosophical ideas begin by a human individual, his actions, feelings and attitudes. Jaspers\u2019 ideas of existentialism were heavily influenced by those of Friedrich Nietzsche and S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard. Jaspers\u2019 works also hint of influence from both Kant and Weber, the latter being a close family friend of Jaspers\u2019. He applied his psychiatric approach to Nietzsche\u2019s philosophical notions, and presented his theories as direct expressions of his outlook on life, rather than fixed postulates.\n\nThe philosophy of Karl Jaspers is based on the idea that a human is not merely existentially present, but he also desires to be more like himself. His three-volume Philosophy (1923) specifically contains these notions. He attempts to explain and explore the height of human experiences. He created the German term \u201cUmgreifende\u201d which literally translates to \u2018the encompassing\u2019; the term was meant to encapsulate the depth and limits of all possible human experiences, both subjective and objective. These would include all those experiences which can never be logically interpreted but are felt by man at a deeper, instinctive level.\n\nInitiating his intellectual journey from science and the observation-based empiricism, Jaspers reaches at another concept of philosophy in his book Existenzphilosophie (1938). He debated with the empiricists of his time and said that whenever a person questions his perceived reality, he/she comes across boundaries which are above our empirical senses and logic. This makes way for the person to choose between despair, depression and a feeling of giving up, or he could make a go at a profound belief which he called \u2018Existen\u2019 which contains in itself a myriad of possibilities and limitless freedom, which forms an integral part of the personality of any individual who faces limiting situations like death, chance, guilt et cetera.\n\nIn the domain of theology, Jaspers strictly opposed religious doctrines and the concept of a personal God. His notions of limited experiences created an impact on modern theology. His religious interests varied. He was largely influenced by the \u00a0religious teachings of Buddha, from which he gave his theory of Axial Age.\n\nIn his political views, an ideal government would be the one which guarantees maximum personal freedom while holding a strong authority where necessary, run by a few intellectuals of choice. Jaspers considered humanism as the best way forward in politics, and advised time and again about the cons of technocracy, an establishment which considers humans as puppets in the hands of the government, who takes wrong advantage of their capabilities.\n\nKarl Japsers taught at the University of Basel in Switzerland, where he simultaneously worked on his philosophical ideas. He maintained his status as a prominent thinker and philosopher in the German intellectual circles, until he passed away in 1969.\n\nToday, Jasper remains largely neglected worldwide, considering the amount of his effort for the evolution of both political philosophy and epistemology. The philosophical circles of Germany attempted at labeling him as an advocate of Existentialism, which he refused to acknowledge."

    "content": "Karl Heinrich Marx was a revolutionary German philosopher, who created a strong impact in the world through economics and politics. He played a major role in shaping much of the modern economic school of thought through laying the basis of concept of labor and relating it with capital. Among his numerous published works, the Communist Manifesto and Das Kapital are the most noteworthy.\n\nThe collective theories of Karl Marx, known as \u2018Marxism\u2019 holds the idea that the struggle between the classes is the cause of progress in a society. He stood against the exploitation of the working class by the capitalist factory and land owners. His strong views and ideas were\u00a0manifested in communism and socialism, the two revolutionary theories which affected the world both socioeconomically and politically.\n\nMarx was of the views that the change in human history was caused by altering human nature, involving both the human beings and material things. He\u00a0assumed that a human has two forms, the actual self and a potential self. Self-development is a process which initiates through the realization that actual self deems the potential self as an object to be improved. Marx debated that the subjective self actualizes the human being by taking the object as its own. Thus, for Marx, human nature was a function of human labor, which he called the \u2018species-being\u2019. For the subject to affect the object, it must first have some form of influence on the material world around the subject.\n\n\u2018Historical Materialism\u2019 is Marx\u2019s philosophy of history, according to which a person should view history dialectically, viewing the changes in material conditions as the means of influence on the society. His views were based on those of Hegel, but differed from his as Marx based dialectics not on ideas like Hegel, but on material.\n\nIn his publication, \u2018Economic and Political manuscript of 1844\u2019, Marx has laid the foundation of his economic analysis. In \u2018The Condition of the Working Class in England\u2019, \u2018Communist Manifesto\u2019, and \u2018Das Kapital\u2019 his views against capitalism found clear expression. Published\u00a0in collaboration with his colleague Friedrich Engels, Marx differentiated communism from numerous other socialist movements in these books. He presented the struggle of the working class under the rule of the bourgeoisie and gave ideas for social reorganization and unification of the proletariat against capitalists.\n\nObserving the worsening conditions of the working class, their long and tedious hours and unsafe environment in the factories, Marx reacted to the capitalist system. He presented an alternative solution, called \u2018Communism\u2019, according to which the bourgeoisie will not be able to hold any lands or factories; all means of production will be owned by the government. All the people will work together for the government and the resulting wealth will be distributed among them according to their needs, and not their efforts, thus leading to a classless society.\n\nEven though his ideas were largely inspired by the French school of thought of Socialism, he openly criticized all idealistic socialists. He was a revolutionary man, expressing the thoughts that minute socialist groups will succumb to nothingness, without causing significant change in society. He aspired for a grand change in the economic system of his era through an all-encompassing socialist community.\n\nKarl Marx proved to be one of the three most important people who created an\u00a0impact on the modern social sciences, the other being\u00a0Max Weber and Emile Durkheim. Various governments in the 20th century laid their foundations on ideas of socialism and communism presented by Marx, such as the People\u2019s Republic of China (1949) and the Soviet Union (1922). Marxism also inspired numerous theories, like Stalinism, Maoism and Leninism."

    "name": "Lao Tzu",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/lao-tzu.jpg",
    "content": "Lao Tzu was an ancient Chinese philosopher and poet, well-known for penning the book Tao Te Ching. He was the founder of philosophy of Taoism, a religious and ethical custom of ancient China. He is largely respected as a religious deity in various traditional Chinese religious schools of thought. He is also believed by some to be an older contemporary of the famous philosopher Confucius.\n\nLao Tzu\u2019s journey began as he set foot towards the western border of China, currently Tibet. He was saddened by what he saw around him: men being diverted away from nature and the goodness it brings. A guard he met on the border asked Lao to write down his teachings as he went. This is when he wrote the famous Tao Te Ching, a 5,000 character account of his thoughts and philosophical ideas.\n\nLike various ancient Chinese philosophers, Lao Tzu made use of rhyme and rhythm, paradoxes and interesting analogies to get his point across in Tao Te Ching. In reality, the entire book can be considered as one great analogy.\n\nThe \u2018Tao Te Ching\u2019, literally meaning \u2018The Way and Its Power\u2019 presents the idea of \u2018Tao\u2019 as being the end all and be all of existence. It is extremely powerful, yet down to earth. It is the source of all being in the world. The book intends to guide people on how to return to the laws and ways of nature to maintain the balance of the Tao.\n\nTzu is also the father of the Taoist philosophy. Taoism, along with Buddhism and Confucianism, is the pillar of ancient Chinese thought. It is not only a customary philosophy, but it has also taken the shape of a properly organized religion. Though the two elements of religion and philosophy are separate, they are profoundly connected. Lao Tzu\u2019s teachings have encompassed the depths of both.\n\nTaoism focuses on leading life according to \u2018Tao\u2019 or \u2018the path\u2019. It encapsulates moral, ethical and religious Chinese customs. Tao is a concept not exclusive to Taoism; it is also found in various other Chinese philosophies. In Taoism however, it plays a major role. As per Taoism, Tao is deep and overwhelming; it is the all-encompassing. It is both the cause and the effect of every existing thing in the world.\n\nLao Tzu\u2019s philosophy was a simple one. He was against putting effort and striving, as he thought struggle is not only futile but also hinders productivity. In his theory of \u2018wu-wei\u2019, he advises to simply do nothing. By this he means not to go against the forces of nature, wait for the gush of events nature brings to you and dive right in. He advised not to struggle to change the natural order of things, but to bring spontaneity to one\u2019s actions as one holds on to the nature\u2019s way of life. Followers of Taoism believe that striving for nothing will never lead them to failure. The one who has never failed is always successful, thus becoming powerful.\n\nBy understanding this principle, Taoist debates against Confucianism and its endeavors at domination and standardization of all aspects of life, and strives for a lone, deep meditation among nature. Taoists believed that through contemplation, nature will grant them the keys unlocking the powers of the universe. The logic of \u2018doing nothing and achieving everything\u2019 reached the rulers and affected the way the kings treated the masses. Thus in a subtle way, Taoism took shape of a political philosophy.\n\nLao Tzu\u2019s works have continued to influence individuals and anti-authoritarian campaigns around the world. Belonging to the sixth century, Lao Tzu, a title given to the great philosopher meaning \u2018Old Teacher\u2019, taught the world the importance of the ways of nature and how embracing the principle of doing nothing can help achieve everything."

    "content": "Lucien Goldmann, a renowned humanist, sociologist and an eminent figure of the movement of Marxist Humanism, was born in Romania, on July 20, 1913. Lucien grew up mostly in Botosani, and was of Jewish heritage. He attended the University of Bucharest to pursue a legal education. At the age of 20, Lucien travelled to Vienna, where he began an extremely vigorous regime of learning. In Vienna, he studied philosophy under the tutelage of esteemed Marxist Max Adler and began devouring the writings of Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs, which greatly influenced him and convinced him that Marxism can provide the solution to all cultural, social and economic problems. He formed his philosophical ideologies on the principles laid down by Luk\u00e1cs, particularly Luk\u00e1cs\u2019 \u201cHistory and Class Consciousness\u201d.\n\nLucien left Germany with the advent of WWII, and settled in Switzerland as a political refugee. During this time, he was presented with the opportunity to work with notable psychologist, Jean Piaget. When the war ended, Lucien travelled to France and recommenced his education. Upon the completion of his education, he took up teaching as a profession and taught various courses at the \u00c9cole Pratique des Hautes \u00c9tudes in Paris. Eventually, he was made the director of studies at the Ecole, and later, he also held the position of director of the Centre for the Sociology of Literature at the Free University of Brussels.\n\nGoldmann is celebrated for his immensely innovative and ground-breaking literary contributions. In his writings, Lucien attempted to apply his theories on Marxism and synthesize them with genetic epistemology of Piaget. Goldman\u2019s first and widely renowned work, \u201cLe Dieu Cache\u201d (The Hidden God), deals with one of his most important ideologies: \u201cvision du monde\u201d or world view, which is basically Goldamnn\u2019s analysis of the world\u2019s perception as defined by any particular social group. Goldmann, through this book, portrays that God is indeed present, and operates as a \u201chidden\u201d and silent observer of events. The book was very well received, and garnered him\u00a0immense fame and esteem.\n\nGoldmann followed up this success with another remarkable composition, titled \u201cPour une sociologie du roman\u201d (Towards a sociology of the Novel). It is based on a study of the novel from Andre Malraux to Alain Robbe-Grillet. Through this book, he introduced the method of \u201cgenetic structuralism\u201d and demonstrated it by associating literary works as a product of the author\u2019s social structures. Goldmann\u2019s sociology of literature is a prominent critic of structuralism.\n\nGoldmann\u2019s final composition, \u201cLuk\u00e1cs and Heidegger: Towards a New Philosophy\u201d, has enjoyed immense acclaim as well as severe criticism. During the 1950s and 60s, when Parisian leftists stubbornly held on to Marxism, Lucien Goldmann emerged as a prominent critic who insisted that Marxism, by that time, was beginning to get out dated, and had to undergo a radical reinvention if it was to survive. Furthermore, he was critical of several aspects of the Marxist view, particularly the role and identity of the Proletariat.\n\nRenowned philosophers such as Jean Piaget and Alasdair Macintyre have described Goldmann as \u201cthe finest and most intelligent Marxist of the age.\u201d"

    "name": "Ludwig Wittgenstein",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/ludwig-wittgenstein.jpg",
    "content": "Ludwig Josef Wittgenstein was a philosopher of an Austrian-British background, focusing mainly on the philosophy of language, mind, mathematics and logic. His early works were inspired by Bertrand Russell, Arthur Schopenhauer and his friend Gottlob Frege.\n\nHe was not the most prolific of writers, publishing a solitary, slim book in his lifetime, called the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. \u00a0He also compiled a children\u2019s dictionary and an article. His thoughts shifted majorly during his lifetime, which is evident in his notes published after his death. However, the problems he tackled remained the same while the approach varied.\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s first published work, the Tractatus, claimed to solve all the puzzles philosophers have tried to decipher over the years. The book was valued greatly by majority of the anti meta-physicists. Wittgenstein tried to present in this book his perception of what is logic, and that all problems arise due to the misunderstanding of logical language. He tried to tell the world that \u2018it is what it is, and it will most probably not change\u2019.\n\nHe also added that his proposed ideas in Tractatus are \u2018non-sensical\u2019. By this he intends that philosophy deals with puzzling questions that are not even present their in the first place. Philosophical theories tend to solve problems which are not, in fact, problems. He further states that these questions and problems arise because philosophers fail to understand the logic of a language. The aim of Wittgenstein\u2019s proposition was that the solution does not lie in solving the problem and gaining wisdom, but rather in eliminating the problem itself by thorough analysis.\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s lecture notes, saved in a blue book, were edited and published after his death under the name Philosophical Investigations. These notes contained his later thoughts on the importance of language, and are considered as a major turning-point in his initial philosophy. In these writings, he compels the people to consider language as a multi-level language-game, where parts of words develop and are exploited. He said that problems arise when philosophers refer to words individually, bereft of any background, usage and context.\n\nHe further said that a philosopher should focus on the grammar of language, as this will help in clearing all misunderstandings. Through grammatical investigation and learning the rules of language, a philosopher will be able to decide what makes sense and is plausible in the long run.\n\nHis last writing was on the topics of skepticism, certainty, knowledge and the doubt we assert on knowledge. These thoughts were in response to G.E. Moore\u2019s debate on skepticism about a world external to our senses. Wittgenstein didn\u2019t outright reject doubts about the presence of an external world. Rather he showed that doubts do not fully perform the task they are assigned: there are certain logical facts which shape our language. When these logical propositions are doubted, our language and logic falls apart.\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein\u2019s thoughts and works have created an impact on almost all fields of social sciences, even though readers have interpreted his words differently. He felt that he was misunderstood by the people of his times, and that people of the future will perhaps understand his works in a better way. Indeed, he proved to be one of the most influential philosophers in the twentieth century, on par with thinker like Immanuel Kant."

    "name": "Marcus Aurelius",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/marcus-aurelius.jpg",
    "content": "Marcus Aurelius was an Emperor of Rome, who ruled from 161 to 180 and was applauded from safeguarding the empire from the cruelty of the Germans and Parthians. However, Marcus is best known for his philosophical pursuits and intellectual prowess. He ranks among the most respected and influential emperors in Roman history.\n\nMarcus Aurelius was born on April 26, 121, in Rome. He belonged to a prosperous and politically affiliated family. Marcus was a brilliant student, and began learning Greek and Latin at a very early age. His interests were soon piqued by philosophy, and his passion for reading made him a great intellectual pursuer of Stoicism, which influenced him to form his ideology based on logic, fate and self-control. Epictetus\u2019 work, particularly his \u2018Discourses\u2019, also had a profound influence on Marcus.\n\nHis dedication and philosophical engrossment did not go unnoticed, and soon the Emperor Hadrian gave him his favor. Hadrian instructed his adopted son, Antoninus, to adopt Marcus as his son. Hence, at the age of 17, Marcus became the son of Antoninus, and also a prospective heir to the Roman throne. His father began instructing him in the affairs of the government and public dealings. In 140, Marcus was appointed as the Consul of the senate, his task was to lead the senate, and gradually with time, he was given greater responsibilities and authority, which he exerted with caution and rationality. Marcus devoted his free time to his philosophical learning, and also began to develop an interest in law. In 145, he married the emperor\u2019s daughter, Faustina, and the couple went on to have several children, of which famous are their son Commodus and daughter Lucilla.\n\nIn 161, upon the death of his adoptive father, everyone looked towards Marcus Aurelius as he had assumed immense authority in his rapid succession to power, and thus, he was the most ideal candidate as monarch. However, in 161, Aurelius assumed his role as emperor by forming a joint rule with his brother, Verus. This turned out to be an extremely fruitful venture, however, their joint rule was marked in conflict and bloodshed. The period of 160s is marked by constant struggle and battle to defend the Roman Empire against the attack by the Parthian empire in a struggle to win over control of the lands in the East. Verus was in charge of the battle while Marcus stayed in Rome. The victory over the Parthian forces is largely credited to the brave generals under the command of Verus, best known perhaps, is the general Avidius Cassius.\n\nThe end of the Parthian War brought the Roman Empire into conflict with the German tribes, when they deliberately crossed the Danube River and attacked and plundered a Roman City. Marcus and Verus raised their troops and prepared for battle, the two embarked together to fight off and defeat the German forces. Verus became seriously ill and died, Marcus continued to fight, and eventually managed to drive out the German forces. In 177, Marcus Aurelius established his son, Commodus, as a co-ruler, and together they fought against the enemies of the Roman Empire. Marcus Aurelius passed away on March 17, 180.\n\nThe life of Marcus Aurelius is not remembered for his glorious rule or for his bravery on the battlefield, but rather, for his philosophical endeavors and his contemplative theories which have contributed to the development of Stoicism. A collection of his works is published in a book titled \u201cThe Meditations\u201d, which contains his personal notes on life. The book contains an in depth philosophical analysis and rational discussion about the personal and significant details of his life. The book discusses discipline and rationality, and proposes three rules formulated by Aurelius: Being content with fate, being just in behavior towards others and using perception while making decisions. The book is highlighted with self-critical and self-advisory phrases that Marcus seems to direct at himself, \u201csuch as wipe out impression; check impulse; quench desire; do nothing at random; those who now bury will soon be buried.\u201d"

He has made notable academic contributions to the fields of Philosophy of Physics, where he has done extensive research into the problems involving the development of quantum mechanics, and Philosophy of Science, where he has formulated theories on general principles and scientific research. He is known for his views considering psychoanalysis as an example of pseudoscience.\n\nMario Bunge was born on August 21, 1919 in the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Mario\u2019s father was an influential congressman and he was raised in an intellectual and politically charged society. His love of philosophy began in his youth and blossomed over the years. He enrolled at the Universidad de La Plata, and in 1952, he graduated from there with a Ph.D. in Physico-mathematical sciences. In 1956, he was appointed a Professor of theoretical physics and philosophy, he held this position for the next ten years. During his tenure, he was awarded a Chair in Philosophy, as well as, a chair in theoretical physics.\n\nIn 1966, unhappy with the turbulent political climate of Argentina, Bunge decided to move to America. In America, Bunge was offered the Frothingham Professorship of Logic and Metaphysics at the McGill University. Bunge now permanently resides in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where he also teaches courses in metaphysics, epistemology and philosophy of science.\n\nBunge has made several notable literary contributions, his major theories are presented in his highly acclaimed work, \u201cTreatise on Basic Philosophy\u201d, a widely discussed work that is categorized into eight volumes consisting of ontology, epistemology, philosophy of science, and ethics. Bunge has authored more than eighty books and 400 papers, some of his remarkable works include, \u201cThe principle of causality\u201d, \u201cPhilosophy of Physics\u201d, \u201cTreaty of fundamental philosophy\u201d, \u201cThe mind-brain\u201d, and \u201cCrisis and reconstruction of philosophy\u201d among others.\n\nBunge has done significant research and analysis into the trivial concepts of global rationalism, scientific realism, materialism, dynamicism, systemism and consequentialism, and he strives to formulate a comprehensive outlook based on scientific principles, which can be collectively applied to all these phenomenon of social and natural sciences. He is best known for his defence of the psicobiologico approach of the study of \u201cSpirit\u201d. Bunge considered himself as a \u201cLeft-wing\u201d liberalist, however, he is considered to be a logical positivist, because of his relentless pursuit of his interest in metaphysics.\n\nBunge has been the recipient of sixteen distinguished honorary doctorates and four honorary professorships from American and European universities. He is a Fellow at the American Association for the Advancement of Science since 1984. In 1992, he made a member of the Royal Society of Canada. In 1982, he received the Premio Pr\u00edncipe de Asturias (Prince of Asturias Award) for communication and humanities. In 2009, he received the Guggenheim Fellowship, and later in 2014, he was awarded the Ludwig von Bertalaffy Award in Complexity Thinking."

    "content": "Martha Craven Nussbaum is an American philosopher of the current times. She is well-versed in Roman and ancient Greek philosophy. Her ideas deal with politics, feminism, ethics and morals. She has also worked greatly for both human and animal rights.\n\nNussbaum has successfully been able to produce a myriad of articles and books. Apart from her literary works, she\u00a0is a renowned personality among the masses, discussing Greek philosophy and theories of Plato\u00a0on various media channels. She regularly reviews books for The New York Review of Books and New Republic; her articles are a must-read for anyone with an appetite for intellectual debate.\n\nIn her book, The Fragility of Goodness, Martha discusses the fact that even if a human being is a follower of order and justice, he is helpless and vulnerable to harm and damage, and is more vulnerable to factors which can hinder his development. She entirely rejects Plato\u2019s idea of defense against harm through morality and goodness, and supports Aristotle\u2019s view of recognizing this potential threat as a way through which human goodness can be appreciated. Her book\u00a0was\u00a0widely praised in academic circles and mass media alike.\n\nIn her book Cultivating Humanity, Nussbaum reaches out to classical Greek philosophy to support her proposed reforms of liberal education. She debates about the role played by literature as a teacher of morals and ethics, and defends the presence of cultural diversity in a society. She supported this book by further literary work, by publishing Not For Profit: Why Democracy Needs the Humanities in 2010, in which she speaks in favor of liberal arts and the threat posed to it globally.\n\nIn Sex and Social Justice, she links the issues faced by the causes of social justice and feminism, by stating that sex and sexuality are irrelevant differences created by society to maintain its hierarchy. She also speaks out against objectification of women, especially through pornography, while simultaneously voicing her support for the legalization of prostitution. She also strongly condemns female genital mutilation practicing, citing its health risks.\n\nNussbaum\u2019s From Disgust to Humanity:Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law was published in 2010. In this book, she presents her philosophy of \u2018politics of disgust\u2019, according to which some legal issues like gay and lesbian rights, segregation, caste system, et cetera are simply there not because they cause actual harm, but merely because they cause an emotion of disgust among the people. This politics of disgust continues to violate the principles of equality and justice, without having any rational groun.\n\nNussbaum, in the \u201880s, joined forces with economist Amartya Sen and presented the theory of \u2018Capabilities Approach\u2019. Together they published The Quality of Life in 1993. The theory of capability approach\u2019 deals with human development. It suggests that development should not only be measured in terms of economy, but also in terms of capabilities, such as voting, living to an old age and performing business et cetera. Thus welfare is not simply physical, it is also potential, that is, the ability of a person should also be considered as a development in the economics of welfare.\n\nMarta Nussbaum has reached the status of the most renowned female American philosopher of the modern times. She holds fifty honorary degrees from universities around the globe. She also serves as the professor of Law and Ethics at the University of Chicago, having previously taught law and philosophy at Harvard, Brown and Oxford."

    "name": "Martin Buber",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/martin-buber.jpg",
    "content": "Martin Buber (1878 to 1965) was a famous philosopher who pioneered the I-Thou and I-It concept, used commonly and widely in the world today. He introduced the idea that interpersonal skills and communication are the two most important things that link human beings and relate them to each other. He published more than 800 articles and books based on this concept highlighting the fact that getting to know a human being is the most important skill.\n\nMartin Buber was born in 1878 in Vienna Austria, to Carl Buber and Elise N\u00e9e Wurgast. His parents got separated in 1882; Buber was four at the time. For the next ten years of his life he lived in Lemberg and was brought up by his grandparents, Soloman Buber and Adele Buber. His grandfather was an influential scholar who published few of the earliest editions of the modern rabbinic literature.\n\nIn his childhood years Buber was home-schooled by his grandmother. After that between 1896 and 1899 he attended various universities including University of Leipzig (1897-1898), Berlin (1898-1899) and Zurich (1899). His subjects of interest were mainly literature, philosophy, poetry and history of art. During his years in Vienna he was greatly influenced by the works of Nietzsche, specially his doctrine of \u201crecurrence of the same\u201d, this influence is quite evident in most of Buber\u2019s later works. Buber was also an active supporter of the German War effort.\n\nIn 1900, Buber met Paula Winkler and moved to Berlin. \u00a0This was also the time when his interest in Judaism increased and he started working for the Jewish cause, which included revitalization of the Jewish community. This included cultural, spiritual and religious revival of the Jews. In 1916, Martin Buber and his wife moved to Heppenheim, a small city near Frankfurt , where he had earlier been employed as an editor. During his years in Frankfurt, Buber met Franz Rosenzweig who offered him a job as a lecturer in the Centre for Jewish Adult Learning (Freies j\u00fcdisches Lehrhaus). After that Buber was also persuaded to take up a job in the University of Frankfurt where he served as lecturer in Jewish religious studies and ethics. In 1937, Buber moved to Jerusalem spending most of his time teaching social philosophy.\n\nBuber\u2019s early philosophical efforts were focused on Kant\u2019s prolegomena of the phenomenon and noumenon which was a correlation between the things that are \u2018perceived\u2019 by us and how they are different from the things that \u2018actually exist\u2019 in time and space. In this he infused his own idea which concluded that noumenon is always preceded by phenomenon. Another famous philosopher who seemed to have influenced Buber\u2019s ideas was Nietzsche and his ideas on the primacy of life and human superiority. Buber was also a strong enthusiast of social philosophy and he edited a forty volume series on \u201csociety\u201d (Die Gesellschaft) for the Frankfurt Publishing House. His\u00a0most famous and perhaps the most important work was I-Thou and I-It concept which focused on the duality of relations. He wrote a book on this concept in 1923 and intended to expand it into a five volume series, which he later abandoned. He also incorporated this idea into religion by explaining how people can have I-thou moments with God and nature\u00a0and\u00a0art and music can be forms of achieving those moments. Buber\u00a0hence developed a new approach to the study of religion rather than enhancing the philosophy of religion.\n\nIn June 1965, Buber died in his residential quarter in Talbieh, Jerusalem. His health had been deteriorating after he underwent a surgery for broken leg. He had been confined to bed for almost a year after which he died at the age of 87."

    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/martin-heidegger.jpg",
    "content": "Born on September 26, 1889 in Messkirch, Germany, Martin Heidegger was\u00a0arguably one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century mainly due to his beliefs against positivism for modernity and technological world domination which makes him largely quoted in the post-modern world.\n\nHe was born in a religious catholic family and was destined to provide service in the local church. His father was also a sexton in the local church. His early education was conducted in Konstanz in 1903 and was financed by the church. In 1906, he moved to Freiburg but in 1911 Heidegger broke off from the seminary and left training for priesthood, some say it was due to health reasons, while other argue it was perhaps due to lack of spiritual involvement. He started studying Theology in the University of Freiburg, and in 1911 he switched subjects to philosophy. He also took up subjects such and mathematics and natural sciences. He had special interest in subjects such as phenomenology, psychology, existentialism political theory and theology. In 1913, he completed his doctorate in philosophy.\n\nHeidegger\u2019s first encounter with philosophy was in his high school years when he started reading Edmund Husserl\u2019s \u201clogical investigations\u201d.\n\nDuring the First World War Heidegger was appointed in the army, but was later discharged due to health issues. In 1915, he completed a thesis on Scotus\u2019s \u201cDoctrine of Categories and Meaning\u201d, after which he was appointed a lecturer in University of Freiberg. In 1916, he became a part of the Freiberg Faculty and was appointed a junior colleague of Edmund Husserl. In 1917, he married Elfride Petri, with whom he had two sons J\u00f6rg and Hermann. In 1918, there was a brief break in his academic career, when he was asked to serve in the army again for the last ten months of the war. After his return from the war, Heidegger announced his break from Catholicism on January 9, 1919. Shortly after that he\u00a0was appointed as Husserl\u2019s assistant and began lecturing at Freiberg. Although he admired Husserl, Heidegger never blindly followed Husserl\u2019s ideas and soon began a radical interpretation of Husserl\u2019s works. In 1923, Heidegger was appointed associate professor at the University of Marburg and till 1928 enjoyed the most fruitful years of his academic career.\n\nHe had a wide range of followers who admired him for his insight and originality. He taught courses on the history of philosophy, time, logic and phenomenology. He was specially influenced by philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Leibniz and Aquinas.\n\nIn 1927, he\u00a0published his famous work on \u201cBeing and Time\u201d. This is one of his most famous and influential works and this was the\u00a0work that earned him full professorship at Marburg and after Husserl\u2019s retirement Heidegger was made the chair of philosophy at University of Freiberg.\n\nIn 1930, his\u00a0life took a political turn as Hitler came into power. Heidegger believed that he could steer the Nazi movement in the right direction. In 1933, he formally joined the Nazi party and produced a number of speeches for\u00a0the Nazi cause. This was one of the most controversial times of Heidegger\u2019s life, not only marked by his political involvement but also by a change in his thinking known as \u201cthe turn\u201d.\n\nThe last decades of his life were spent writing and publishing generously but there was no marked change in his philosophy or thinking. His insightful essays were on topics such as \u201cWhat are Poets for?\u201d (1946), \u201cLetter on Humanism\u201d (1947), \u201cThe Question Concerning Technology\u201d (1953), \u201cThe Way to Language\u201d (1959), \u201cTime and Being\u201d (1962), and \u201cThe End of Philosophy and the Task of Thinking\u201d (1964).\n\nMartin Heidegger died on May 26, 1976, and was buried in the churchyard in Messkirch."

In 1784, Mary took her sister away and a legal divorce was arranged.\n\nFebruary 1784 was the beginning of many of Wollstonecraft\u00a0\u2019s endeavors when she established her first school with the help of her sister Elisa and friend Fanny. They established their first school at Newington Green where she started on her first set of works \u201cThoughts on the Education of Daughters\u201d. Her school soon became unstable and failed to provide her with income after which it collapsed. \u00a0She later became the governess to the daughter of Lord Kingsborough\u00a0and spent most of her time in Ireland. In 1787, she was dismissed from work after which she settled in\u00a0George Street, London.\n\nIn 1788, Joseph Johnson provided her with an intellectual job as a translator and literary advisor. This acquainted her\u00a0with most of London\u2019s intellectual circles. Mary Wollstonecraft\u00a0soon became a regular contributor of articles and radical writings to Johnson\u2019s analytical review. She made up for her lack of education by spending a lot of her time reading and reviewing and most of translating work gave her extensive knowledge of the works of Kant and Leibniz.\n\nIn 1792, Wollstonecraft \u00a0published her famous work \u201cA Vindication of the Rights of Woman\u201d in which she stressed that women\u2019s lives under tyranny of domestic brutes frustrated them \u00a0and \u00a0made them violent towards their children and servants, it also advocated women\u2019s rights to education and their equality to men in this regard. After publication of her first work she\u00a0started on her second work \u201cMaria: or, The Wrongs of Woman\u201d, in this she wrote about the strong sexual desires of women and how it was wrong to suppress them. She wasn\u2019t able to complete this book, which was published unfinished in 1798 after her death.\n\nShe\u00a0went to Paris and at a friend\u2019s house met Capt. Gilbert Imlay whom she married in La Havre in May 1794 and bore him a daughter, Fanny. In 1795, Imlay deserted Mary and left her emotionally unstable. After some time she\u00a0stabilized herself and went to Somers town to live with William Godwin. She later married Godwin because of her pregnancy. In September 1797, Mary gave birth to a second daughter after which\u00a0her health declined and she died.\n\nMary was both famous and infamous for her radical thoughts and activity against the oppression of women. She was known most commonly for her feminist theories but her political and moral thoughts gained fame only decades after her death. She was arguably one of the most influential writers and women rights activists of the eighteenth century."

    "name": "Max Scheler",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/max-scheler.jpg",
    "content": "Max Scheler was born on August 22 1874, in an orthodox Jewish family. He was the most influential philosopher of his time, known mainly for his ideas on phenomenology.\n\nIn his early years Scheler was not a very strong student, but did show early interest in philosophy. In 1894, he started study at\u00a0the University of Munich and by the fall of 1895 got himself enrolled in the University of Berlin. He studied medicine, philosophy and sociology.\n\nIn 1896, he\u00a0moved to Jena to study philosophy under Rudolf Eucken who was a popular philosopher at that time and here he started his career in philosophy. In 1897, Scheler received his doctorate. \u00a0In 1898, he took a trip to Heidelberg to meet Max Weber. In 1899, Scheler received associate professorship at the University of Jena. He taught at the University from 1900 to 1906. During this period he met Edmund Husserl in Halle in 1901, he was greatly inspired by Husserl\u2019s ideas, and a year later read his \u201clogical Investiation\u201d. This was the beginning of Scheler\u2019s interest in phenomenology. After he ended his career in Jena in 1906, Scheler started working in Munich as Privatdozent. There he established a circle of \u201cmunich phenomenologists\u201d.\n\nScheler was a target of various controversies regarding adultery and had reportedly been involved in affairs with various students after separation from his first wife. This was one of the main reasons for his negative image. From 1910 to 1919 Scheler remained secluded as a private scholar, lecturer and freelance writer. These were the most productive years of Scheler\u2019s life and during this time, he published his major works in phenomenology and works such as \u201cTheory of Feeling of sympathy and of love and hate\u201d, \u201cFormalism in ethics and non-formal ethics of value\u201d.\n\nIt was also at this time that Scheler became co-editor, along with Husserl, of the greatly influential journal, Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Philosophie und ph\u00e4nomenologische Forschung.\n\nIn 1918, Scheler received an invitation to teach at \u00a0a newly founded Research Institute for Social Sciences in Cologne officially joining the faculty in 1919 and here he started working on his famous piece on religion, \u201cOn the eternal in man\u201d which was published in 1921. During his time in Cologne his circle of influence grew and he met and corresponded with many of the leading philosophers of the time and these correspondences were not only limited to philosophers but also included psychologists, natural scientists, musicians and scholars of the time. His diverse set of friends helped Scheler develop extensively as a writer. This is one reason why Scheler\u2019s works extend from such as sociology of knowledge, philosophical anthropology, metaphysics, politics and history. During this time he lectured extensively at universities across Germany.\n\nSoon Scheler divorced his second wife and got married to his third wife; this endangered his position in the university as a catholic professor. Seeing the conservative ideas of the Catholic Church he made himself distant from the Church and specified the nature of his work as philosophical not religious.\n\nIn 1927, he\u00a0was offered a position as professor at\u00a0the University of Frankfurt. In 1928, his health began to worsen and he suffered from a series of heart attacks and died as a result of one episode of heart attack on May 19th 1928 in Frankfurt.\n\nScheler\u2019s works on the definitions of phenomenology and philosophy, personalism, community and solidarity won him great recognition even after his death."

    "name": "Max Stirner",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/max-stirner.jpg",
    "content": "Max Stirner, renowned German philosopher, was born on October 25, 1806, in Bayreuth, Bavaria. His birth name was Johann Kaspar Schmidt, however, during his stay at the Altsprachliche Gymnasium, due to his high forehead, his classmates gave him the nickname of Stirner. Max pursued his bachelor\u2019s degree at the universities of Berlin, Erlangen and Konigsber. He was among the regular audience of Hegel\u2019s lectures on religion, history of philosophy and the philosophy of subjective spirit. During his final academic years, Striner\u2019s mother became seriously ill, and Max, now caught up with family obligations, had to overlook his education.\n\nThus, he was barely qualified as a teacher, and the employment opportunities he received were discontinuous and insecure. His professional career is marked with such disappointments. He worked as a Latin instructor for a year and a half, however he went unpaid. Eventually, he managed to secure a permanent employment a private girl\u2019s institute, where he taught literature and history for five years, and his fame as a competent instructor began to spread. During this period, Max began frequenting the Hippel\u2019s Weinstube which was located on Friedrichtrasse. Here, he had managed to find an intellectual haven in the shape of a free community of philosophers and thinkers lead by Bruno Bauer. This association of thinkers called themselves the Die Frien, their meetings were famous for being passionate and loud, even physically aggressive at times. Max, though famous for his polite manner of expression, soon began actively engaging in the ongoing debates, and his opposition of religion and moderation became a regular discussion for the Die Frien.\n\nStirner was offered to write for the magazines, Leipziger Allgemeine Zeitung and Rheinische Zeitung, however, his journalistic ventures met with little acclaim during its early years. This changed in 1843, when he published the article, \u201cThe False Principle of Our Education\u201d, which dealt with pedagogy. In 1846, Stirner published his masterwork, \u201cDer Einzige und sein Eigenthum\u201d (The Ego and Its Own) which won immense critical acclaim and praise. The book dealt with individualistic anarchism, and was based on Stirner\u2019s concept of rejection of religion, morality and authority. Following that, Max contributed various articles to several prominent journals, and in 1852, he published a section of History of Reaction.\n\nThe 1850s was a very hard time for Stirner, as he began encountering severe financial restrictions. His creditors began pursuing him and he was forced to change his residence to avoid them many times. He was imprisoned in 1853 and 1854, due to his inability to pay his debts. Two years later, he died from an infection caused by an insect sting.\n\nStirner is not only known for his literary contributions, but also for translating the works of leading economists such as Jean-Baptiste Say and Adam Smith. His works include \u201cDer Einzige und sein Eigenthum\u201d, \u201cGeschichte der Reaction: Die Vorlaufer der Reaction\u201d, and \u201cDie moderne Reaction\u201d. Max Stirner\u2019s philosophies have played a significant role in the evolution of the Russian and German schools of anarchism. It is also said that Karl Marx derived the influence for his philosophies from the works of Max Stirner."

    "content": "Miester Eckhart was born in 1260 at Hochheim, a village near Gotha and was named Eckhart von Hochheim. He was initially known to have been born in a notable family of landlords, but this was later reported to be false and the origin of his family and early life remain ambiguous.\n\nHe received his early education at cologne and later he became a prior at Erfurt and the provincial of Thuringia.\u00a0 In 1300 Eckhart went to Paris to work as a lecturer and complete his education. He stayed there for three years and after returning to Erfurt, became the provincial of Saxony. In 1307 he was appointed the vicar-general for Bohemia, to set the demoralized monasteries there in order.\n\nIn 1311 he started teaching in Paris, in one the most famous schools of the order. After this time till 1320, little is known about Eckhart\u2019s engagements.\n\nEckhart was accused of heresy after he returned to Cologne. Hermann von Virneburg made this accusation before the pope, but these accusations were not acknowledged. In February 1327 Eckhart stated in a public protest that he detested everything wrong and nothing of the kind could be found in any of his writings. In 1329 however, many of his works were regarded as heretical at the close of the statement the court stated that before Eckhart\u2019s death he recanted everything he had falsely taught and preached, by subjecting himself and his works to the apostolic see.\n\nShortly after this event Eckhart\u2019s death took place. After his death, Eckhart\u2019s disciples were admonished for their inattentiveness and were advised to be more cautious in the future. The court also generated orders against preachers who conducted subtle endeavors to preach things that led people into error.\n\nEckhart\u2019s works were read widely throughout the 13th century and also by many people in the centuries to follow. His trial on heresy however shadowed his reputation. A very few of Eckhart\u2019s works were known even after his death which is why it was very difficult to conclude what his views were. Eckhart wrote extensively on metaphysics and spiritual psychology.\n\nMany of Eckhart\u2019s works were filled with paradoxes. He refused to call God \u201cgod\u201d and referred to Him as \u201cdeity\u201d, stating that it is impossible to give God a finite definition and at the same time he mentioned that God is a finite being and that God cannot be defined as something absent or negative. He stated that the true way for the soul to attain salvation, is by its unity with God. Such knowledge is given in the traditional teachings of the Church but according to Eckhart, the way to attain that unity with god does not necessarily agree with the formal preaching of the Church.\n\nEckhart argued that God manifested himself in all his beings, and that everything real is truly God\u2019s being. The difference between the beings is mainly something negative. He also said that creatures are nothing without their divine essence and may that divine essence be removed there will be nothing left. This concept of Eckhart was difficult to conceive by many of his disciples.\n\nEckhart\u2019s main teachings were based on the fact that he expected all souls to be internally connected to God and to be led by Him, and in this he emphasized that all the creatures will be led into positivity. His teachings were based on the mere idea of sublimity and purity. It was these influential positive teachings that made him such a strong and influential preacher.\n\nAfter the 19th century Miester Eckhart received a renewed attention mainly after most of his works were published in 1935. It was after this time that he became renowned as great spiritual mystic and influential philosopher."

    "name": "Michel Foucault",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/michel-foucault.jpg",
    "content": "Born on October 15, 1926 in Poitiers, France, Michel Foucault was a famous activist of the structuralist and post structuralist movements. His father, Paul-Andr\u00e9 Foucault, was a well-known surgeon in France and so was his maternal grandfather. This strong family background in medicine predetermined his future career, but Foucault\u2019s early interest in philosophy made him defy all such assumptions. Although his didn\u2019t pursue medicine, much of Foucault\u2019s philosophical work revolves around medical discourses.\n\nFoucault\u2019s early schooling was carried out in Poitiers and he had great interest in philosophy since\u00a0his school days. In 1946, Foucault entered \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure and attended lectures of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Martin Heidegger on phenomenology. These two teachers had a great impact on Foucault as a philosopher, as is evident in his first publication, which\u00a0focuses heavily on existentialism and marxism. But as Foucault developed as a philosopher, he turned away from both these aspects of philosophy.\n\nFaoucault completed his education at \u00c9cole Normale in 1951 where he earned a degree in philosophy and psychology. He also developed his interest in philosophy here, when he joined the French communist party in 1950. He then started teaching as a professor of psychology. He also took up a job as a laboratory researcher, and till 1955 continued to work there in different capacities. His years at \u00c9cole Normale were shadowed by an attempted suicide, which many maintain was due to his difficulties coming to terms with his homosexuality.\n\nIn the 1960s, Foucault became academically established, after holding various positions at French universities. In 1969, he was elected a professor of history of systems of thought, in the prestigious Coll\u00e8ge de France. After the 1970s, Foucault became very active politically. He founded the famous Groupe d\u2019information sur les prisons and often protested on behalf of homosexuals and other marginalized groups.\n\nMichel Foucault\u2019s main areas of interest were philosophy, psychology, politics, literature and history. He wrote many books, mostly on the histories of medical and social sciences. He is hardly ever perceived as true philosopher although most of his works may be critically reviewed as philosophical.\n\nJean-Paul Sartre was a French thinker preceding Foucault and although he had no personal influence on Foucault, was very similar to him in his interest in psychology and literature. Foucault soon began defining himself as very different and often in contradiction to Sartre. He rejected many of Sartre\u2019s ideas including the judgement of society in terms of transcendent principles. But despite all of Foucault\u2019s efforts to distinguish himself from Sartre there remains a tinge of similarity between the two philosophers which is clearly evident in their works.\n\nFoucault\u2019s philosophical reasoning lies heavily on questioning the already based human ideas. His main focus of reasoning was human and biological sciences. According to him, the truths about human nature are based on the ethical, political and cultural norms of the existent society and are not justified by scientific truths. He has explained these ideas in his \u201ccritical philosophy\u201d.\n\nHe frequently lectured outside France, particularly in the United States. In 1983, he agreed to teach annually at the University of California at Berkeley. It was probably in the United States that Foucault contracted HIV. As an early victim of AIDS, Foucault died in Paris on June 25, 1984."

    "name": "Miguel De Unamuno",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/miguel-de-unamuno.jpg",
    "content": "Miguel de Unamuno, was a Spanish philosopher, poet, author, journal, scholar, journalist and writer, who is best known for his novel \u201cAbel S\u00e1nchez\u201d, a modern adaptation of the biblical story of Cain and Abel. Unamuno\u2019s life was embroiled in serious controversies due to his open criticism of Spanish dictator Miguel de Rivera, and later, his condemnation of Francisco Franco\u2019s Falangists.\n\nMiguel de Unamuno was born on September\u00a029,\u00a01864, in Bilbao, Spain, to parents, Felix de Unamuno and Salome Jugo. He was a descendent of the Basque heritage, and he had inherited the independent spirit and self-pride of his ancestors. Miguel\u2019s father passed away when he was six years old, and he, along with his mother, began living with his grandmother. He was raised in a devout catholic household, and for quite some time, Miguel aspired to become a priest.\n\nIn 1880, Unamuno was accepted at the University of Madrid, where his religious fervour was soon replaced by an intellectual search, he began devouring books on psychology, philosophy and history. By the age of 20, Miguel had learnt 11 languages, and he was able to read foreign literature with great ease. Soon, he began frequenting \u201cGeneration of 1898\u201d, a popular literary society dedicated to the revival of the intellectual society of Spain. He enrolled in a four year degree for a doctorate in philosophy.\n\nIn 1890, Unamuno returned to his native city Bilbao, and began working as a tutor and essayist. Later, he was appointed as a professor at the University of Salamanca. In 1891, he married his childhood fianc\u00e9e, Concepcion Lizarraga, and they went on to have 10 children.\n\nIn 1895, Unamuno published his first compilation, a collection of essays that analysed Spain\u2019s ancient position and influence in Western Europe, titled \u201cEn torno al casticismo\u201d (Around Reason). In 1901, he was appointed the rector at the University of Salamanca. In 1913, he published \u201cDel sentimiento tr\u00e1gico de la vida en los hombres y en los pueblos\u201d (The Tragic Sense of Life in Men and Peoples), which dealt with the contrasts between logic and faith. In 1917, he published his hugely applauded and widely read novel, \u201cAbel Sanchez\u201d, a modern day take on the biblical story of Cain and Abel. A common trait identified in all publications by Unamuno is the trial and contest faced by his characters to retain and safeguard their honor against the societal forces of compliance and allegiance.\n\nIn later 1924, Spain became embroiled in a political turmoil as General Miguel Primo de Rivera overthrew the parliamentary government, and declared himself a dictator. This political turmoil soon took over Miguel\u2019s life as well, as Unamuno began composing and publishing a series of essays criticizing Rivera\u2019s government and harsh tactics. Rivera took serious notice of this, and Unamuno was estranged from his family and exiled to the Canary Island. Miguel succeeded in escaping to France, where he lived for the next six years, engaged in publishing caustic and brutally critical articles directed against the King and Rivera.\n\nIn 1930, the fall of General Miguel provided Miguel a chance to return home to Bilbao, where he was offered back his position as a rector at the University of Salamanca. However, the advent of Francisco Franco\u2019s revolt dragged his life into the midst of controversy. Although, initially Unamuno was in favour of Franco\u2019s revolt, soon he became disillusioned by the movement\u2019s harsh tactics to gain power, and began openly opposing their practices. In 1936, Unamuno publicly denounced Franco and his movement, whereupon, he was removed from his position as the rector.\n\nFranco gave orders for Miguel de Unamuno\u2019s execution, however, he later choose to banish him to house arrest. Miguel passed away from a heart attack two months later, on\u00a0December 31, 1936, at the age of 72."

    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/niccolo-machiavelli.jpg",
    "content": "Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli was a distinguished Italian diplomat, and an acclaimed author. His rise to fame is attributed to his work, \u2018The Prince\u2019, a handbook for unconscientious politicians, which led to the origination of the terminology \u201cMachiavellian\u201d. This book has inspired generations for centuries, and has given Machiavelli the status of \u201cfather of modern political theory\u201d.\n\nNiccol\u00f2 Machiavelli was born on May 3, 1469, in Florence, Italy. He hailed from an affluent family and received an education complementing his wealth and social status. He entered the Florentine government after being accepted for the position of a clerk in 1494, the same year the Medici family was disgraced and exiled. Soon, he launched his career as a diplomat, and upon exhibiting his remarkable intellect, he was sent on diplomatic missions to several major cities in Italy as well as abroad, including France and Spain. He was presented in front of eminent personalities of his time as the ambassador of Florence, including Louis XII, Pope Julius II and Ferdinand II. Machiavelli was placed in charge of the Florentine militia, and he was also assigned to reorganize the military defence of Florence.\n\nIn 1512, the Medici family came back into power, and the Florentine republic was dissolved. Machiavelli became involved in organizing a Florentine militia against the return of the Medici family, and hence, he was dismissed from his post as a diplomat, arrested for his involvement in the conspiracy and brutally tortured. His political life came to an end, and he retired to his father\u2019s estate, located on the outskirts of Florence.\n\nMachiavelli compiled his masterwork during the bleakest period of his life when he was barred from his political career. He had all the time to spare, and he began educating himself on Roman history and compiling political discourses. His most praised and widely discussed work, titled \u201cThe Prince\u201d, deals with the dynamics of monarchical rule, and portrays Machiavelli\u2019s ethics of free will and determination to control one\u2019s own destiny, which leads to the establishment of order and maintenance of supreme power. This treatise, over the centuries, has achieved the status of a handbook for the politician, and has led to the coining of the term \u201cMachiavellian\u201d.\n\nMachiavelli is accredited for several remarkable literary contributions to the discipline of Politics. He published his first compilation, titled \u201cDiscorso sopra le cose di Pisa\u201d. He followed that up with another highly acclaimed treatise, titled \u201cDiscorso sopra la provisione del danaro\u201d (Discourse about the Provision of Money). The same year, he published another treatise where he explored several crucial themes such as rebellions by citing the example of the Romans, entitled \u201cDel modo di trattare i sudditi della Valdichiana ribellati\u201d (On the Way to Deal with the Rebel Subjects of the Valdichiana). His other highly praised works on Politics include \u201cRitratti delle cose dell\u2019 Alemagna\u201d (Portrait of the affairs of Germany) and \u201cRitratti delle cose di Francia\u201d (Portrait of the affairs of France) among others. Machiavelli has also published a novel in 1527, titled \u201cBelfagor arcidiavolo\u201d. He wrote several poems, and three plays: \u201cMandragola\u201d (The Mandrake, 1518), \u201cClizia\u201d (1525), and \u201cAndria\u201d (1517). Mandragola is perhaps the most famous and widely enjoyed, it is a comedy that portrays Machiavelli\u2019s ethics implemented in Italian society. During his stay in Lucca, he compiled \u201cLa vita di Castruccio Castracani da Lucca\u201d (The Life of Castruccio Castracani of Lucca), a comical account of the life of the medieval duke of Lucca. He also wrote the \u201cSommario delle cose della citta di Lucca\u201d, which is basically an account of life and society in the city of Lucca.\n\nNiccol\u00f2 Machiavelli was appointed as the official historian of Florence by Pope Leo X, and he was commissioned to compile the history of Florence. He\u00a0completed this work in five years, and presented it to Pope Clement VII in 1525, titled \u201cIstorie fiorentine\u201d (History of Florence). In 1526, he was appointed superintendent of the Procuratori delle Mura di Firenza, his job was to inspect the Florentine fortifications. However, he was soon removed from this post when the Medici family was thrown out of power in 1527. Following this, Machiavelli became increasingly disillusioned, and on\u00a0June\u00a021,\u00a01527, he passed away. He was buried in the Church of Santa Croce, in Florence."

    "content": "\u201cLanguage is a process of free creation; its laws and principles are fixed, but the manner in which the principles of generation are used is free and infinitely varied. Even the interpretation and use of words involves a process of free creation.\u201d- Noam Chomsky\n\nNoam Chomsky is an American philosopher, logician, linguist, cognitive scientist, activist and political commentator. Born on December 7th, 1928, he is well-known as the \u201cFather of modern linguistics\u201d. He is one of the significant personalities in analytic philosophy. He currently teaches as a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He has also written more than 100 books, been voted as \u201cWorld\u2019s Top Public Intellectual\u201d in a poll conducted in 2005. He graduated from University of Pennsylvania in the field of linguistics.\u00a0 He obtained his BA, MA and PhD in linguistics. After that, he served at Harvard University at the society of fellows.\n\nNoam Chomsky is one of the most eminent cultural personalities. He became an important personality in the field of linguistics by developing Chomsky hierarchy, Chomsky-Schutzenberger theorem and the universal grammar theory. Noam Chomsky acquired public attention by his open opposition to Vietnam war. Though he got arrested multiple times for his open opposition but he gained popularity as an anti-war activist. He is also a humanitarian with profound interest in anti-war activisim as well as public activism.\n\nNoam Chomsky has produced a diverse range of theories and concepts in the fields of psychology, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, philosophy, political science, logic and programming language and theory. At present, Chomsky is a well-known political activist, US foreign policy, state capitalism and news media critic. He is a supporter of libertarian socialism as well as anarcho-syndicalism.\n\nNoam Chomsky developed a linguistic theory based on the proposition that the structure of a particular language is determined biologically by the human mind that is based on the language principles. According to this linguistic principle, language can be genetically transmitted and human beings possess similar language structure irrespective of their differences in social and cultural factors.Chomsky is prominent for the fact that he investigates a wide variety of\u00a0formal languages to assess the capability of that language to capture key properties of a certain language. His very own\u00a0Chomsky hierarchy\u00a0allocates formal grammars\u00a0into classes with expressive power at an increasing rate. This implies that every unique successive class has an ability to generate a diverse set of formal languages from the original one.\n\nNoam Chomsky is a living legend in the field of linguistics as well as politics. Chomsky\u2019s unmatched concepts in the field of linguistics has earned his work the title of \u201cthe most dynamic and influential\u201d school of thought developed. There are many academic achievements, awards and honors earned by Naom chomsky especially by the prestigious universities including Oxford University, University of Cambridge as well as University of Toronto to name a few. He was awarded the Sydney Peace Prize in 2011 as well as at AI\u2019s Hall of Fame for his contributions in the field of artificial intelligence."

    "name": "Parmenides",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/parmenides.jpg",
    "content": "Parmenides was a fifth-century BCE Greek philosopher, belonging to the city of Elea. Under the guidance of his teacher, Xenophanes of Colophon, he founded the Eleatic School of philosophy, which classifies truth on the basis of pure logic and rationality, and does not accept sense experiences as valid. He was\u00a0also known for leading an exemplary life; the Parmenidean lifestyle serves as a proverb for the Greeks.\n\nParmenides is one of the few known philosophers before Socrates. He gave up the customary prose of his Ionic ancestors and wrote a poem in hexameter, which survives in bits and pieces. The poem titled \u2018On Nature\u2019 was originally divided into three parts, namely the proem, the alethia and the doxa. It is an account of the narrator\u2019s journey to meet a goddess, who unveils to him the secrets of existence.\n\nThe \u2018Proem\u2019 contains the introductory verses of \u2018On Nature\u2019. Parmenides describes the journey of a young man who travels from the darkness of the night (ignorance) to the bright light (enlightenment) of the day, to meet a goddess who imparts him with knowledge of truth based on facts, and informs him of the validity of human opinion, which represents an aspect of the truth.\n\nThe \u2018Alethia\u2019 or \u2018The Way of Truth\u2019 debates the art of distinguishing the truth from opinions formed by humans. Parmenides states his famous theory of truth, according to which reality of an object can be judged based on the phenomenon that it is, and that it is not. There is nothing in-between existence and non-existence.\n\nIn the third part of his poem, the \u2018Doxa\u2019 or \u2018The Way of Opinion\u2019, Parmenides shifts his philosophy to the origin of the universe by explaining the structuring of cosmos and deals with Pythagorean scientific theories. He further states that our perception of the\u00a0world, formed through our sensory experiences, is often faulty and illusory.\n\nParmenidean philosophy focuses on finding the truth through reasoning and logic only, without letting experiences and senses interfere with it. You can reach the truth by basing it on two possibilities: whether the object exists or not. Parmenides believed that we cannot speak for an object which is not there, as it would be far from truth.\n\nBy not speaking about non-existing phenomena and objects, Parmenides wants us not to get confused in the path between being and non-being: the path on which we are governed by our senses and which mixes both the existing and non-existing worlds.\n\nThus he insists on questioning reality by first accepting that it exists. Rational inquiry should not include non-beings, as per Parmenides. Through this method, he drew out the conclusion that the \u2018existing\u2019 is continuous, perfect, non-perishable and ingenerated.\n\nWhat truly is surprising for Parmenides\u2019 readers is the fact that after stressing on the unimportance of observations and senses, he proceeds by explaining how our observed world came into being. One possible explanation, according to commentators, is that perhaps Parmenides agrees that there are two kinds of realities, one greater than the other. The greater reality is what exists and how it really is, as explained in the \u2018On Truth\u2019 section of his poem. The inferior reality is based on our observations, which is often delusional. Thus the science of cosmogony would be best described through the lower level of reality.\n\nParmenides\u2019 views and philosophy has continued to inspire thinkers over the millennia. Plato was largely influenced by him, in turn affecting the spectrum of Western philosophy. The Eleatic school of thought has also benefited greatly from Parmenides\u2019 works."

    "name": "Peter Singer",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/peter-singer.jpg",
    "content": "Peter Singer, is a renowned Australian philosopher, whose groundbreaking contributions to the discipline of moral philosophy have paved the way for the revolutionary formation of applied ethical behavior. His work has raised criticism over controversial issues such as violation of animal rights, human-animal intercourse, justifying killing of handicapped infants, abortions etc. Singer\u2019s work has given an intellectual and philosophical nudge to the masses through his radical thinking, and has caused a social fervor and devout seriousness.\n\nPeter was born as Peter Albert David Singer to a Jewish family on\u00a0July 6, 1946, in Melbourne Australia. His parents were Viennese Jewish immigrants, who had been subjected to the turbulent upheavals and horrors of the war, they themselves had barely escaped the concentration camps and managed to seek refuge in Australia. Peter\u2019s father was an exporter of tea, while his mother was a doctor. For his early education, Peter was enrolled in Preshil School, and later he attended the Scotch College for his secondary education. In 1946, he received his Bachelor\u2019s degree in Law, History and Philosophy from the University of Melbourne, and in 1969, he received his Master\u2019s degree from the same university. Upon receiving a scholarship, he enrolled himself in a Doctorate program at the University of Oxford, he received his Ph.D. in 1971. His doctoral thesis was published as a book in 1973, titled \u201cDemocracy and Disobedience\u201d.\n\nIn 1971, Singer published his first article, titled \u201cFamine, Affluence and Morality\u201d, where he put forward his ideas on the reasons for making charities to prevent deaths from starvations, and he also discussed several methods explaining how these charities should be made. In 1975, he published his widely praised and much discussed book, titled \u201cAnimal Liberation\u201d, which dealt with animal welfare, and introduced Singer\u2019s concept of \u201cSpeciesism\u201d, where humans beings, in the modern culture, are said to categorize animals. His book also supported the ideas of veganism and vegetarianism. The same year, he accepted the position of a Radcliffe lecturer at University College, Oxford, along with his position of an active visiting faculty at the New York University. In 1976, he decided to return to his native city, Melbourne, and concentrate on his career as an author. For the next five years, Singer concentrated his energies on composing his literary works, in 1976, he published his remarkable work on animal rights, titled \u2018Animal Rights and Human Obligations: An Anthology\u2019. Over the course of the next 5 years, he published 3 more widely acclaimed books, titled\u00a0 \u2018Practical Ethics\u2019 (1979 , \u2018Marx: A Very Short Introduction\u2019 (1980), \u2018Animal Factories\u2019 (1980), and \u2018The Expanding Circle: Ethics and Sociobiology\u2019 (1981).\n\nIn 1977, he was appointed the Chair of Philosophy at the Monash University, where later, he was also appointed the first director of the Center for Human Bioethics. During his tenure at the University, Peter Singer founded the International Association of Bioethics. During 1982-1985, Singer published four more books, titled: \u2018Hegel\u2019 (1982), \u2018Test-Tube Babies: a guide to moral questions, present techniques and future possibilities\u2019 (1982), \u2018The Reproduction Revolution: New Ways of Making Babies\u2019 (1985) and \u2018Should the Baby Live? The Problem of Handicapped Infants\u2019.\n\nDuring the 80s and the early 90s, Singer devoted his time to composing his revolutionary and radical thoughts into remarkable literary works, which garnered worldwide appreciation and millions of devout fans who began devouring his works. Some of the notable works published by him during this period include, : \u2018Ethical and Legal Issues in Guardianship Options for Intellectually Disadvantaged People\u2019 (1986), \u2018Animal Liberation: A Graphic Guide\u2019 (1987), \u2018A Companion to Ethics\u2019 (1991), \u2018Save the Animals!\u2019 (1991), \u2018Embryo Experimentation\u2019 (1993), \u2018The Great Ape Project: Equality Beyond Humanity\u2019 (1995), How Are We to Live? : Ethics in an Age of Self-Interest\u2019 (1993), Rethinking Life and Death: The Collapse of Our Traditional Ethics\u2019, \u2018The Greens\u2019, and \u2018The Allocation of Health Care Resources\u2019.\n\nIn 1999, Singer was appointed the Professor of Bioethics at the University Center for Human Value at Princeton University. However, due to the controversies generated in America regarding his radical ideas on bioethical issues, his employment required justification. Singer has been the recipient of several awards and accolades befitting his valuable and effective work. In 2004, he was presented the title of \u2018Australian Humanist of the year\u2019 by the Council of Australian Humanists.\u00a0 In 2009, Time magazine included Peter Singer\u2019s name in its list of \u201cThe 100 Most Influential People in the World\u201d. More recently, in 2012, he was named a Companion of the Order of Australia in light of his remarkable contributions to the field of philosophy and bioethics. Currently, he serves on the Advisory Board of Incentives for Global Health, an NGO dedicated to the development of the Health Impact Fund Proposal, along with, the advisory board of Academics Stand Against Poverty (ASAP)."

    "name": "Plato",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/plato.jpg",
    "content": "Plato was a classical Greek philosopher and mathematician, influencing the realm of Western philosophy. He remained a diligent disciple of Socrates, and along with Socrates and his renowned student Aristotle, he found the first higher learning academy in Athens. Plato\u2019s philosophy is heavily influenced by Socrates, Parmenides, Heraclitus and Pythagoras. It deals with the ideas of morality, observation, reality, love and sexuality.\n\nPlato was so inspired by his teacher Socrates, that his early writings are accurate reports of his master\u2019s words, conveyed to the reader in the form of dialogues. These early dialogues are presented as questions and answers, and each tackle a sole vital issue. His writing Euthyphro questions whether morally correct actions are approved divinely. In Apology, Plato puts forward Socrates\u2019 version of how to lead a philosophical life, as presented by him to the jury of Athens. The Crito debates whether a citizen of a state is ever correct about disobeying the rules of the state.\n\nBy the time Plato presented his middle works, he developed a distinct thought process of his own, which is evident by the main character\u2019s representation of Plato himself, as opposed to Socrates being the main character earlier. He interconnects politics, metaphysics, epistemology, morality, psychology and a myriad of issues to present an intricate philosophy of his own. The middle dialogues also include his famous work Republic in which he denounces various forms of arts, and says that arts and poetry merely replicates reality and creates overwhelming feelings. In Meno Plato discusses whether goodness can be taught, and that no one intends to act wrongly. The\u00a0Phaedo lays down the principles of Plato\u2019s famous Doctrine of the Forms, which claims that human soul is imperishable.\n\nThe later writings of Plato gave up the shape of dialogues. They examined in detail the Theory of Forms, knowledge and cosmology, and political discussion about a state\u2019s rules and regulations in his works titled Parmenides, Theaetetus,Timaeus and Laws.\n\nIn many of Plato\u2019s dialogues, Socrates suggested that the world perceived by us is not real, it is a mere deception created by our senses. The form of the real world can only be reached through reason. This real world of forms is unseen and unchangeable, while what we observe is constantly under change. This is Plato\u2019s Theory of Forms.\n\nHe\u00a0often discusses\u00a0the father-son relationship in his philosophical works. He looked down upon those fathers who spent lavishly on tutoring their sons, as he believed that knowledge and goodness is a divine gift, which cannot be taught. It can only be polished.\n\nSimilarly, he presents Socrates\u2019 idea of knowledge being a recollection of memories, not observation or studying. He stresses on the notion that knowledge cannot be gained through inspection alone, when one lacks deep insight. Plato also discusses at length his views on immortality and afterlife. He also compares phenomena such as knowledge and opinion, reality and observation.\n\nThe famous notion of \u2018Platonic love\u2019 is his idea that when lovers resort to physical pleasures, their love will not achieve higher form of divine beauty, which Plato calls the \u2018Beauty Itself\u2019. He often presents lovers as each other\u2019s halves, and says that love alone is heavenly madness, a state where the lover can achieve the highest aspirations humanly possible. Keeping this view, Plato thought\u00a0that people give up the true power of love by limiting themselves to mere physical beauty and its few pleasures.\n\nThe profound notions and questions put forward by him have dazzled readers of all ages, religions and places. Without a doubt, Plato has remained one of the most influential and widely-read thinkers throughout the history of philosophy."

    "name": "Ren\u00e9 Descartes",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/rene-descartes.jpg",
    "content": "Early Life\n\nRen\u00e9\u00a0Descartes was a French philosopher and mathematician born on 31st March 1596 in La Haye en Touraine, now known as Descartes, France. At 8, he started going to \u2018Jesuit College Royal Henry-Le-Grand at La Fleche. After his graduation in 1616, he started his further studies at the University of Poitieres earning a Bachelor degree in Law in accordance to his father\u2019s wishes who wanted him to become\u00a0a lawyer. Descartes showed exceptional mathematical aptitude from an early age. His mathematical skills were pretty honed by the time he reached university where he found the solution to a difficult mathematical problem that even the Principal could not solve.\n\nAfter his return from the Dutch Republic, Descartes spent most of his time in Paris and travelling throughout Europe. It was during this time that he composed his earliest works, his essay called \u2018Regulae ad Directionem Ingenni\u2019 translated as \u2018Rules for the Direction of the Mind\u2019. He went back to Dutch Republic where he stayed for a year studying mathematics at the University of Franeker and then Leiden University. Even though he continued to move throughout the Netherlands, he somehow managed to produce his most influential works in this time period.\n\nWorks\n\nDescartes published many essays including \u2018The Meteors\u2019, \u2018Dioptrics\u2019, \u2018Geometry\u2019 and the most famous \u2018Discourse on the Method\u2019. In 1641, he published \u2018Meditations on First Philosophy\u2019 followed by \u2018Principles of Philosophy\u2019 in 1644. Descartes was known as the \u2018Father of Modern Philosophy\u2019 and most of today\u2019s philosophy is based on his works. His works are studied as part of the course in all university philosophy departments. The \u2018Cartesian Coordinate\u2019 system is named after none other than Ren\u00e9\u00a0Descartes, in which algebraic equations can be expressed as geometrical shapes in a 2-D coordinate system. His works allowed us to build a bridge between algebra and geometry and thus he is called\u00a0\u2018Father of Analytical geometry\u2019. His work in analytical geometry proved to be very significant in the discovery of infinitesimal calculus and analysis.\n\nDescartes was a major influence on the modern philosophy and it is only due to his efforts that he was able to rout skepticism. The previous mathematicians such as Euclid and Archimedes who, no doubt were brilliant actuaries, clearly did not present the results in the method by which they were conceived. Descartes on the other hand believed that only the correct methodology could lead to scientific and mathematical development.\n\nDescartes invented the method of representing the unknown numbers in equations as x, y, z and the known numbers as a, b and c. He was the pioneer of the standard notation in exponents that is the use of the superscripts. His work was the foundation for other mathematicians such as Newton and Leibniz. The \u2018Descartes Rules of Signs\u2019 is used even today to define the number of positive and negative roots of a polynomial. He was also\u00a0the founder of the Descartes Law more commonly known today as Snell\u2019s Law.\n\nDeath\n\nDescartes is famous for his philosophical statement \u2018Cogito ergo sum\u2019 which translates to English as \u2018I think, therefore I am\u2019. Ren\u00e9\u00a0Descartes died at the age of 53 on 11th February 1650."

    "content": "Robert Nozick was a well-known American philosopher, who advocated libertarian thoughts and ideas through his work. Mainly known for his book, Anarchy, State and\u00a0Utopia, Nozick ruled the domain of political philosophy. This publication also won him the 1975 National Book Award for Philosophy and Religion. He also made significant contributions to other aspects of philosophy and presented theories on epistemology and personal identity.\n\nNozick promoted anti-consequentialist ideas similar to that of John Rawls\u2019. \u00a0He argued that a state\u2019s foremost duty is ensuring the fulfillment of the rights of its citizens and that should be its only interference in the lives of its citizens.\n\nNozick was a libertarian at heart; he strongly believed in granting limited power to the state and the government, giving them the control of defense, law and police protection only, while economy, education and welfare must be controlled by religious or private institutions. The reason behind Nozick\u2019s support for libertarianism was\u00a0not sociological or economical, rather it was\u00a0moral. He backed this specific political philosophy as he held great respect for human rights in his heart, and believed that these rights cannot be fulfilled until the citizens are granted maximum liberty within the state.\n\nAccording to Nozick, people should be considered an end in themselves. He was a supporter of Kant\u2019s idea in this regard that people are not a means to gain something else. To apply this humanitarian idea practically, Nozick considered the libertarian, minimal state system as a way through which all human beings would be able to achieve their idea of a good society.\n\nNozick, after giving his elaborate theories on political philosophy, moved on in his career to contribute to various other areas of philosophical thought. He, unlike Rawls, gave theories on personal identity, epistemology and metaphysics. His second book, Philosophical Explanations (1981) contains his signature theory of knowledge and an externalist approach towards philosophy of how minds work, which won him the prestigious Ralph Waldo Emerson Award by the Phi Beta Kappa Society.\n\nIn the field of epistemology, Nozick put forward a problem-solving system which provided solution to the questions by both skepticism and the Gettier problem. This significant argument shunned the importance of justification when gaining knowledge of a certain phenomenon.\n\nNozick\u2019s later works also contain some significant contributions to philosophy, where he presented a complex theory on rationality in his 1993 book The Nature of Rationality. In The Examined Life (1989), he ponders on the motives behind our existence and the deeper meaning of our lives. Even though these works generated much controversy and attention among the philosophical schools of thought, Nozick\u2019s theory of libertarianism still remains his most influential contribution to philosophical inquiry.\n\nThe 2001 book Invariances: The Structure of the Objective World\u00a0was\u00a0Nozick\u2019s last work, in which he presented his take on objective reality. Besides philosophy, he also drew notably from economics, biology and physics, which gave a unique perspective to his readers.\n\nRobert Nozick is well-known for raising endless philosophical possibilities in his works, leaving the final answer to be extracted by the readers themselves. He also remained one of the youngest philosophy professors at Harvard and Princeton University. He passed away in January 2002. He remains a widely-recognized political philosopher and a strong advocate of libertarianism till date."

    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/roland-barthes.jpg",
    "content": "Roland Gerard Barthes was an influential French philosopher and literary critic, who explored social theory, anthropology and semiotics, the science of symbols, and studied their impact on society. His work left an impression on the intellectual movements of Structuralism and Post-Structuralism.\n\nBarthes started his philosophical journey with reactive ideas to the phenomenon of existentialism. \u00a0In his book Writing Degree Zero (1953), he expresses his thoughts by saying that by sticking to a certain style and convention of writing, authors often lose their original form which leads to lack of creativity and unoriginality. By this he means that creativity is a continuous process of gradual change, which can be perfected only through constant practice and resilience.\n\nFollowing his debut, his works Mythologies (1957), Critical Essays (1964) and The Eiffel Tower and Other Mythologies (1964), explore the meaning we have associated to various popular cultural icons, ranging from the world of fashion to advertising to wrestling.\n\nIn his book The Fashion System, Barthes shows how various signs and symbols can be twisted and reinterpreted in different ways. He explains how any word can be associated with glamour and idealistic meaning in the field of fashion. People are likely to associate any piece of clothing with luxury and beauty if fashion tells them to, according to Barthes.\n\nBarthes\u2019 most renowned work is an essay titled \u201cThe Death of the Author\u201d (1967) in which he presents his famous literary theory. He strongly opposes the incorporation of an author\u2019s background, education, caste, ethnicity, religion, nationality and gender while interpreting his literary works.\n\nBarthes was of the view that a writer and his work are separate entities, and so they must not be related when his work is critically examined. Keeping in mind the author\u2019s biasness and religious and political leanings while examining his texts might seem an easier way to understand his works, but in reality it is a flawed system which can potentially limit the readers\u2019 understanding.\n\nIn his book S/Z (1970), Barthes expresses his opinion on what constitutes an ideal text. According to Barthes, a text is truly ideal if it not restricted in meaning, and can be interpreted in many different ways. He introduces two literary terms: writerly text, meaning text which can be creatively understood by the readers, and readerly text, in which readers are restricted to the meaning intended by the writer.\n\nAll in all, Barthes maintained a unique literary philosophy and a vague, eccentric writing style which was widely copied by writers worldwide. His theories gathered equal amounts of praise and criticism by readers and critiques alike. After the 1970s, his philosophy had spread not only in France, but also in America and Europe. He inspired various philosophers and thinkers, among which are Michael Foucalt, Jacques Lacan and Jacques Derrida.\n\nHis last books, an autobiography titled Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes (1975) and A Lover\u2019sDiscourse (1977) established his stature as a literary stylist and writer. Barthes passed away at the age of 64. A Barthes Reader (1982) and Incidents (1987)\u00a0were\u00a0published by his friend Susan Sontag posthumously.\n\nHis critical approach to literature greatly contributed to the development of semiotics, structuralism and post-structuralism. His philosophy is not restricted to these schools of thought; in fact, it has affected various modes of communication, such as photography, music, and even computers. Roland Barthes work is ever-changing and ever-adaptive, providing new insights to literary philosophers even today."

    "name": "Rosa Luxemburg",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/rosa-luxemburg.jpg",
    "content": "Rosa Luxemburg was a Polish political philosopher, economist, marxist, and revolutionary who played a pivotal role during the First World War \u00a0and the German Revolution. She founded, along with Karl Liebnecht, the anti-war Spartacus League in 1915, which later became the Communist Part of Germany. The Red Flag, the vital organ of the Spartacist movement, was also founded by her during the German Revolution.\n\nUntil the Russian Revolution, Luxemburg believed that a revolution would certainly take place in Germany, but when Russia revolutionized, it became one of the most important experiences in Luxemburg\u2019s life. She moved to Warsaw to participate, and was captured. She gained valuable ideas from this experience which she presented in her 1906 work The Mass Strike. According to Luxemburg, mass strikes are the best method the working class can use to gain victory. Mass strikes are likely to act as a fuel in any socialist revolution. Her point of view differed from Lenin\u2019s as she did not believe in a tightly-structured political party. Through the Dialectic of Spontaneity and Organization, her significant political philosophy, Luxemburg put forward the idea that through spontaneity, organization and order can be achieved, when working for class-struggle through a political party. She held the view that class struggle reaches a higher level when it starts spontaneously from within the proletarians.\n\nIn her 1913 work, The Accumulation of Capital, Luxemburg analyzed economics and politics and put forward the theory that the spread of capitalism in undeveloped areas of the world leads to the nuisance of imperialism. She also left the Social Democratic Party during this time as she struggled for the initiation of mass action.\n\nAlong with Karl Liebknecht, she founded the Spartacus League, which was based on her 1916 pamphlet, The Crisis in the German Social Democracy, written in jail. Through the League, they intended to end the World War and establish the rule of the working class, but the actual impact of the League during the war did not prove to be as strong as it was intended.\n\nWritten in 1922, The Russian Revolution criticized the Lenin\u2019s party for their terror-inducing and tyrannical methodologies. Luxemburg championed democracy, unlike Lenin who supported democratic centralism. She also chastised the Bolsheviks\u2019 opportunist and agrarian political policies during The Russian Revolution.\n\nDue to her strong opinions and ideas during the Spartacus Revolt, she was arrested in Berlin by conservative paramilitary forces known as the Free Corps, and was later murdered in January 1919.\n\nHer collection of political philosophies, collectively called Luxemburgism, is a revolutionary set of ideas under the realm of Marxism. The significant ideas of Luxemburgism include a pledge to struggle for democracy and the spontaneous class struggle which would organize itself to bring about revolution.\n\nMany socialists and Marxists may disagree with the philosophy of Rosa Luxemburg, but she will always remain as a steadfast revolutionary thinker who sacrificed her life for her principles. Her commitment to democracy and strong negation of capitalism has earned her the respect of Socialists from around the globe. The commemoration of Rosa Luxemburg as a martyr of Socialism takes place to this day, among the left-wing politicians of Germany, irrespective of their identification and agreement to her political philosophy. Decades after her murder, she is alive in her revolutionary ideas."

    "content": "Rudolf Joseph Steiner was a philosopher, educationist and a social reformer from Austria. He was also the founder of anthroposophy, a spiritual movement stemming from German idealism. He\u00a0was deeply influenced by the works of Goethe and worked greatly towards relating science with spiritualism.\n\nThe evolution of Steiner\u2019s philosophy and work can be classified into three phases. In the first phase, he worked on what he called the \u2018spiritual science\u2019, an attempt at bridging the gap between physical sciences and the human spirit. The second phase consisted of Steiner\u2019s collaboration of various media, such as music, drama and arts and architecture with his work. After the First World War began the third phase of his thought evolution, during which he practically applied anthroposophy to the fields of agriculture and medicine.\n\nHe\u00a0based his theory of knowledge mostly on the ideas presented by Goethe. According to him, the ability to think is equal to the sensory ability, such as the sight and sound. Steiner\u2019s contribution to epistemology is the theory that our mind perceives ideas just like the eye perceives an image and the concept that human knowledge is limitless.\n\nSteiner commented extensively on Goethe\u2019s works between the period of 1884 to 1887, presenting Goethe\u2019s perspective of the world in his 1886 and 1897 books The Theory of Knowledge\u00a0Implicit in Goethe\u2019s World-Conception \u00a0and Goethe\u2019s Conception of the World. In his later books, Steiner said that Goethe\u2019s approach changed from experimentation to imagination as he delved into the world of biological sciences. Goethe also believed that human anatomy is the evolutionary form of the animal anatomy, according to Steiner.\n\nSteiner\u2019s major philosophical contribution is his two-stage answer to epistemological questions relating knowledge and freedom, presented as Truth and Knowledge (1892) and Philosophy of Freedom (1894). In the former he argues that the world is divided into tangible, perceivable objects and ideas reachable only by the mind. For the complete understanding of the world, we must find a path which makes use of both our perception and thinking capabilities. For Steiner, truth is not just a discovery but also an invention. Therefore, one individual\u2019s version of truth differs from other.\n\nIn his most famous work, the Philosophy of Freedom, Steiner probes deeper into the process of thinking, and comes up with the theory that freedom can be achieved only through the action of creative thinking. By \u2018being free\u2019 he means to be fully conscious of the results of our deeds, and to think about things which do not originate from the body, or the society, but from our spirit.\n\nSteiner believed that is was this book which laid the foundation of the philosophy of anthroposophy, movement which claimed of the existence of a spiritual world which can be reached through the highest level of knowledge. Steiner presented the idea that the human mind is capable of contacting the spiritual world through the power of thinking. To propagate this notion further, he formed an Anthroposophical Society in 1912, which developed over the period of time and currently has many branches around the world.\n\nRudolf Steiner\u2019s contributions as an educationist can never be forgotten. Through his essay \u201cEducation in the Light of Spiritual Science\u201d, he gave his method as to how a child can be mentally developed through education. He believed that schools should not be under the control of the government. In 1913, he laid the foundation of the first Goetheanum, as a spiritual science school, which changed into the Waldorf School Movement, currently having more than thousand schools globally. He also inspired various educational projects for disabled persons, and schools of arts and drama."

    "name": "Seneca",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/seneca.jpg",
    "content": "Seneca, also known as Seneca the Younger, was a significant philosopher belonging to the Roman times. His works, essays and tragedies majorly contributed to the development of Stoicism, a school of thought which states that virtue and goodness is based on knowledge. Many students and followers of stoic approach came towards the philosophy through the contributions made by Seneca.\n\nSeneca wrote twelve essays on philosophy, a hundred and twenty-four letters on principles of morality, nine tragedies and satire. \u00a0His writing style was engaging, as he believed that any philosophy would be best conveyed to the reader by truly involving him the in thought process.\n\nThrough his writings, Seneca touched the major themes of stoicism: suffering is inevitably important, simplicity leads to contentment, the universe is being dealt with divine rationality, and that knowledge should be gained in any and all forms. He attempted to help his readers out by making them face their problems in life and by providing logical steps on how to solve them. One major theme of his letters is acceptance of human mortality and how to channel ones\u2019 fear of death into motivation for virtue.\n\nEven though his writings mirror the main ideas of Stoicism, Seneca established his worth as an independent thinker and not as a single-minded, rigid philosopher. In one of his works, On the Private Life, he emphasizes the point by stating that he will not do what was ordered to him by his leaders, but he will do what he was led to.\n\nIn the same book, and in On Peace of Mind, he discusses the choice of leading a practical and political life or a life of thinking and philosophy. He asks what amount of thinking and activity would make us live at peace with ourselves, and concludes that thinking is equally important to acting. Philosophical thinking is the basis of our actions, and is thus important for leading a peaceful life.\n\nOn the topic of soul, Seneca states that soul is a rational being, able to act on its own. He holds the Stoic view that soul is physical; it is a body. He bases his theory on account of the fact that only bodies are capable of action and can cause a reaction.\n\nSeneca is often attributed with being the discoverer of the concept of will. He states all human souls leave impression which affects other human souls. All souls have the power to either accept or negate these impressions. By accepting these impressions, souls make our bodies act accordingly. Thus all actions are completely controlled by our decisions of accepting and rejecting certain soul impressions. We have the power to be virtuous or evil.\n\nOn human emotions and reactions, Seneca was of the view that emotions mirror a person\u2019s opinion. Emotions cannot be controlled; they are illogical. He worked in great depth on the emotion of anger and came to the conclusion that an ideal person would try to replace his angry outburst of emotion with a response based on righteousness. He also wrote extensively on fear of death, and how it can be tamed to achieve virtue and greatness.\n\nSeneca also differentiated the good from the valuable and discussed how money and health is valuable, but not good, as it fails to bring us true happiness. According to him, only virtue and benefiting others can bring contentment. \u00a0A good person\u2019s life, even if he is not helping others with his actions, is still beneficial, as virtue affects from far away.\n\nSeneca\u2019s philosophy is one of righteousness, virtue and morality. His concepts on theology, philosophical psychology and epistemology have been neglected for centuries. The recent times have witnessed the revival of Senecan philosophy, as more Stoicists and philosophers rediscover the loftiness of Seneca\u2019s ideas."

    "content": "Sigmund Freud was\u00a0one of the most influential psychologist, physiologist and philosopher of the mind belonging to the twentieth century. With the help of his colleague Joseph Breuer, he developed the theory of the mind as a complex energy structure. Freud\u2019s most important contribution to humanity in general and psychology in particular is the development of psychoanalysis, a practice devised to treat the mentally ill through dialogue.\n\nThe famous theory of Unconsciousness presented by Freud is one of its kind, in which he presents the idea that a large portion of human attitudes can be explained through mental processes and resulting actions which are not clearly visible. Thus the centuries-long approach of deeming the behavior of a neurotic patient as unexplainable is a faulty one, according to Freud. Rather, the odd behavior can be critically observed to draw out the causes explaining it, so as to treat it. Slips of tongue and dreams can act as a doorway through which the hidden causes of his mental ailments can be recognized. This gives rise to the notion that us mortals are not completely free to act according to one\u2019s will, and there are some mental processes running in the background which determine our deeds.\n\nFreud further said that the unconscious consists of the thoughts and feelings which humans have repressed over the years, usually tracing back to events taking place in the childhood. These suppressed thoughts return to the wakeful mind under certain circumstances, such as hypnosis. This leads to the fact that humans are not even unaware of their own thoughts and ideas.\n\nInitially Freud thought that repression was a conscious act, but by his second paper on neuroscience, he had changed his views, and had termed repression as an \u2018unconscious defense\u2019. In The Interpretation of Dreams (1899) and Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious (1905), he delves further into the topic of the Unconscious.\n\nFreud also classified instincts into two basic types; Eros: the human instinct related to life and sexuality and the Thanatos: the instinct of death and destruction. Irrespective of the two major classifications, the sexual drive termed as libido is the most important motivator of human actions, according to Freud. In fact, he even claimed of discerning sexuality in humans from infancy. He defined sexuality as a form of pleasure derived from the body. Humans throughout their lives act with one motive behind their minds: the gain of bodily pleasure.\n\nIn his works Beyond the Pleasure Principle (1920) and The Ego and the Id (1923), Freud presents the model of the human psyche, dividing it into three parts, namely the Id, Super-Ego and the Ego. Id is entirely the unconscious mind, which operates solely for the gain of pleasures. Id is the source behind all human instincts and motivations. The Super-Ego acts as a filter between the Ego and the Id, and acts entirely on moral principles. The third part called the Ego strives to strike a balance between the moral and immoral aspects of a person\u2019s mind, and is reflected majorly through a person\u2019s actions.\n\nFreud, through his concepts of the Conscious and Unconscious, and through practice of hypnosis, was led to the treatment of psychological disorders through talking, which he termed as psychoanalysis. He attempted relaxing the patient at first and depriving them of sensory stimulations, and then made them speak up their thoughts without any interference or censorship. Through this method he aimed to weaken the forces of the moral guide, the Super-Ego, in order to reach the cause of the disorder hidden somewhere in the Id. This method proved effective as Freud observed a decrease in the symptoms of the patients.\n\nThe impact of Sigmund Freud\u2019s contributions in the field of psychology, semiotics creativity, and neuroscience can never be neglected. Even though his concepts have sparked much debate and controversy, Freud has been termed as the father of modern psychology."

    "name": "Simone De Beauvoir",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/simone-de-beauvoir.jpg",
    "content": "Simone de Beauvoir was a French literary personality, an existentialist by philosophy and a feminist by nature. Her essays, novels and other works greatly influenced feminist existentialism and social theory. Throughout her life, de Beauvoir never claimed herself to be a philosopher and a critical thinker. However, through her major contributions to politics, ethics, feminism and existentialism, she has earned the respect of the masses as an established philosopher, social activist and an intellectual.\n\nBeauvoir debuted as a philosopher in her novel She Came to Stay (1944), in which she reflected on how each of us are connected to time and to each other. Through the characters, the author presented her outlook on these relations but do not give a clear conclusion to the events. Right after the novel, Beauvoir published her first philosophical essay titled Pyrrhus and Cineas in 1944. She debates on the topics of morality and ethics and says that being free is to be constantly dependent on others. She explains that an individual can only exercise their freedom of choice when it is accepted and supported by others around them. A person can only act on the values he holds dear when the society he lives in embraces it too.\n\nAfter suffering in a Paris occupied by Nazis, Beauvoir emerged as a changed person, determined to take a stand against the evil in the world. Through the Ethics of Ambiguity, she becomes a contributor to peace. She openly identified with existentialism in this book, and stated that it is the only theory which is applicable to the evil times they were living through. She argues against Dostoevsky\u2019s statement that the absence of God makes all acts permissible and states that without God\u2019s presence, human responsibility increases manyfold. She also touches the concepts of ambiguity of our consciousness and shuns the concept of God as she holds humans entirely responsible for their acts and its consequences. The book also explores the topic of violence, holding the idea that at times violence becomes inevitable, for instance, for the liberation of the suppressed.\n\nIn 1949, Beauvoir published her world-famous analysis of female existentialism which resulted in a revolutionary movement, inspiring women around the world. She was of the view that a person is not born into their gender, but rather they grow into it, adopting the attitude of that gender out of choice. She said that women are equally capable as men of choosing their thoughts and actions, and of taking charge of the world. She addresses Plato when she says that women do not have to think and act like men to be considered on par with them.\n\nBeauvoir is also credited with penning down the finest existentialist literature of her times. All her literary works portray human reactions to situations of turmoil and conflict in the society. In SheCame to Stay (1943), she shows the havoc selfhood can wreak through complex characters. \u00a0Her next novel The Blood of Others (1945) won appreciation of many, and deals with how an individual can be held responsible for the society. In All Men are Mortal (1946) she discusses life and death, and in critically acclaimed The Mandarin (1954), she speaks about the role mass media plays in stirring up change in the society.\n\nIn addition to her philosophical essays and literary novels, Beauvoir dedicated four publications to her life experiences and complied an autobiography, starting from Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter (1958) with concluding it on All Said and Done (1972).\n\nSimone De Beauvoir remained a towering literary figure throughout her life and only after her death was she also recognized as a feminist philosopher and intellectual. Her ideas ignited a revolution of feminist existentialism which has influenced women around the world."

    "name": "Simone Weil",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/simone-weil.jpg",
    "content": "Simone Weil was a mystic, social activist and philosopher from France during the era of the Second World War.\n\nWeil was an incredibly bright student, becoming well-versed in ancient Greek and Sanskrit in her teenage. She was also a kind soul, as her compassion and empathy led her to boycotting sugar at the age of five, when she learnt that it was unavailable to the French soldiers fighting in the First World War. She did not only study philosophy, but also learnt science, philology and languages throughout her career. She mainly taught philosophy during her life, while privately jotting down her intellectual ideas which gained popularity after her death.\n\nUpholding the distinctiveness of her personality, Weil took the path less taken by the leftists of the twentieth century: the path of mysticism and religion. Being born in a secular Jewish household, she unexpectedly became interested in Christian mysticism and became deeply religious. This affinity towards religion can also be observed throughout her philosophical essays and compilations.\n\nIn addition to religion, politics is also a major concern in Weil\u2019s works. She linked spirituality with social responsibilities and presented a relationship between groups and the individuals they accommodate. She was concerned with the hardships the working class has been bearing throughout the beginning of times and aimed at strengthening the bond between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.\n\nIn Lectures of Philosophy, a compilation of lectures for her Philosophy classes by Weil contains many topics among which the concept of truth is a highly discussed one. She defines truth not only on a rational level, but psychologically as well. She discusses what experiences are required for an individual to classify an event as \u2018true\u2019.\n\nWhile dealing with metaphysics, the concept of absence remained a matter of great interest to her. According to Weil\u2019s beliefs, God is the all-present, and is fully here, while the creatures of God have only been created where God was not present. This idea bears similarity to the concepts present in Jewish mysticism.\n\nThe notion of affliction, or \u2018malheur\u2019, is also present in Weil\u2019s philosophy. She deems affliction as a greater pain than suffering, a pain which only some souls are capable of feeling. \u00a0These souls are active spiritually, and are also the least deserving of this great pain. Affliction is an additional suffering which transcends the body and mind, and directly wounds the soul.\n\nHer collection of writings has been divided into twenty volumes. Gravity and Grace (1947) is her most important work, comprising of her ideas of religion and spirituality. In the essay TheNeed for Roots (1949), she presses upon the responsibilities of an individual to his state and vice versa. In Oppression and Liberty (1955), Weil deals with atrocities of war and the hardships factory workers face regularly. Waiting for God (1951) is her spiritual autobiography, while Notebooks is a three-volume commentary on miscellaneous philosophical ideas. Her works mostly deal with the relationship between God, men and society, and the moral and spiritual limitations the modern lifestyle has brought with itself.\n\nSimone Weil passed away while suffering from tuberculosis during World War II, as she refused to eat more than the minimum portion allocated for each soldier at the time of war.\n\nHer writings were given their due appreciation late after her death. Even though her work is neglected in the modern times, her compassion and love for humanity has earned her the respect of those who have come across her ideas."

    "name": "Socrates",
    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/socrates.jpg",
    "content": "Socrates was a classical Greek philosopher born in the Athens in 470 BCE. His thoughts and teachings which have reached us through the works of his disciples have greatly helped in shaping the modern Western philosophy.\n\nSocrates himself had written nothing, and whatever access we have to his mind is through the philosophical dialogues of his students, mainly Plato and Xenophon. His students portrayed him as a man with great intellect and wisdom, who would provide answers to their philosophical inquiries through thought-provoking dialogue.\n\nSocrates\u2019 mastery lies in the art of conversation, the proof of which can be found in the writings of his students Plato, Xenophan, Phaedo, Euclides, Antisthenes and Aeschines. Even though these works serve as an insight into Socrates\u2019 philosophy, they cannot be credited word-for-word to Socrates, as they only contain the general idea of his teachings, and are not historical records of his philosophy.\n\nNamed after this maestro is an entire science of debate and discussion called the Socratic Method. The basis of the Socratic Method is questioning. This method involves discussions based on stimulative questions which are asked as an answer to puzzling inquiries, and which aim at triggering an individual\u2019s critical thinking skills.\n\nIn a nutshell, the Socratic philosophy is one full of contradictions. His concept of virtue and evil, of knowledge and ignorance, are paradoxical as they are not in accordance with common sense.\n\nSocrates most famous paradox is the knowledge of his ignorance. He never claimed to be wise and the all-knowing, in fact, he admitted that he knows that he knows nothing. According to Socrates, no one commits a wrongdoing to harm others but because he knows nothing better. Only knowledge can cultivate virtue, and one must never strive for material gains but for true virtue.\n\nOn morality, Socrates asks in Euthyphro by Plato that whether God loves the pious because he is good or is he good because the gods love him. If piety is based on God\u2019s love, then it depends entirely on what God wills. On the other hand, if God loves someone due to his righteousness, then there must be a rational code of moral conduct which differentiates right from wrong, and which must be accessible to all to follow.\n\nFor Socrates, the pursuit of knowledge should be the foremost goal of an individual. He believes that without philosophical inquiry and thinking, one\u2019s life is unworthy of living. The righteousness of thought and idea is the most important thing for Socrates. He believed that every person is capable of judging right from wrong and is thus solely capable for his actions and inactions.\n\nIn the domain of politics, Socrates idolized a state run by philosophers and thinkers. He deemed intellectuals as the only type of person capable of governing over the masses. In Republic by Plato, Socrates clearly disregarded democratic form of government which was present in Athens at that time and dreamt of an establishment run by philosophers alone.\n\nBecause of his open criticism of the state and religion of Athens, and for his ideas of morality, Socrates was convicted by the noble jury for the corruption of the society. He did not accept silence or exile, and was thus penalized to death. In 399 BCE, Socrates took his own life by drinking a cup of poison as punishment for his ideas. Because he chose death over intellectual silence, Socratic ideas are alive to this day, as they continue inspiring millions over the course of time."

    "content": "Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz was a self-taught scholar, writer, poetess, nun and a feminist philosopher belonging to a Mexico which was a part of the Spanish Empire. Born on 12 November 1651, Sor Juana was an exceptionally bright child, and had learned to read by the age of three and had written her first poem at the age of eight.\n\nShe was sent to live in the Mexico city at the age of sixteen, and this was where she started self-studying, after being denied education on account of being a girl. In the year 1667, she began her life as a nun, while continuing to study books on various matters. She also taught drama and music in the convent school.\n\nSor Juana stood at the brink of the Hispanic Baroque as its last great writer, and was at the entrance of the colonial Mexican literature. She read anything and everything, from satire, philosophy, to religion and mythology. She wrote various forms of poetry, including religious hymns, satire and love poems. She also wrote both religious and comical plays as her expertise ranged from deeply philosophical to popular comedy, something unusual for a nun at that time.\n\nSor Juana also had a strong grip on rationality. Even her religious poems are tightly logical. She was a strong feminist as she deeply felt the injustice towards women, especially in their right to education. She considered women not only as objects of passion, but of wisdom and knowledge. In her poem The Foolish Men, she charges men with the same irrational behavior with which they blame women. \u00a0Her various love poems also mention of the burdens of love, the loneliness, sorrow and the illusion of love a woman encounters during her lifetime. She penned many dramas with strong feminist themes, in which the main characters are often capable, independent women, ready to change the world with their intellect.\n\nIn her most well-known poem, First Dream, Sor Juana expresses the thirst of the soul for knowledge. It is an autobiographical writing, and shows how a soul escapes the body during the night to gain knowledge of everything, but returns to the body in the morning with new hope of learning.\n\nFor her, philosophy was not a task but an unconscious action, as she famously said that one can philosophize whilst cooking dinner. For her, the study of social sciences was vital to understand God. She always defended the honorable cause of female literacy, and gave various examples of learned women from Christianity and the Bible to make her point to the masses and the authorities.\n\nBecause of the increasing pressure of society, Sor Juana left behind the world of knowledge and held back her intellectual pursuits in 1694. She stopped writing, and her personal book collection was sold for meager prices. On 17 April 1695, she passed away suffering from plague as she nursed the nuns during the epidemic.\n\nHer wisdom, ideas and the constant hunger for knowledge has earned her the respect of many. She remains a national icon of the Mexican culture, and her picture is part of the Mexican currency. The rise of feminism in the 20th century has brought Sor Juana\u2019s philosophy back to prominence. She is known as the first published feminist writer of the modern world."

    "content": "Born on 5 May 1813, S\u00f8ren Aabye Kierkegaard was a Danish theologian, poet, author and a philosopher of existentialism. He wrote extensively on religion, morality, ethics, human psychology and religious philosophy. He focused on the importance of a single human being and his choices, and gave precedence to concrete truth over abstract thinking.\n\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard prolifically wrote in various forms and styles, covering a wide range of topics, from Christendom to philosophy to Aesthetics. He attempted an array of rhetorical methods, such as polemical, dialectical, humor, and satire et cetera, all exclusively penned down to deepen the understanding of the subject.\n\nHis works concerned with theology consists of his commentary on the organization of the Church, ethical teachings of Christianity, proofs of Christianity as a true religion, the qualitative difference between God and man, and a person\u2019s personal connection to God. He was especially interested in the topic of love in Christianity, and sharply criticized linking the state with religion, especially in Denmark.\n\nApart from being a world class theologian, psychologist, poet, author, humorist, and a social theorist, he was mainly known as the Father of Existentialism. His philosophy revolves around Existentialism, a theory which suggests that a human being is completely free and has the capability of making his own choices as he wills.\n\nAmong other concepts, two of the most famous concepts by Kierkegaard are \u2018subjectivity\u2019 and the \u2018leap of faith\u2019. His idea of leap of faith is how a person believes in another person or in God, and how he acts irrationally in his belief. Blind trust can never come from evidence, as then you would be believing in the proof of that being, and not believing in the being itself. He said that believing in something is to doubt it at the same time. Part of our faith in God is the doubt of his existence, which is the rational response of our mind. It is this doubt which completes our trust in God, as with the absence of doubt in the face of evidence, our belief will remain not in God but in the proof of God.\n\nIn his philosophical Fragments, Kierkegaard focuses on the importance of an individual and his relation with the world at large. He believed in subjectivity being the truth, and in truth being subjectivity. Explaining his view, Kierkegaard says that every person knows the objective fact, but his subjective response to that fact constructs his exclusive truth. He mainly discussed religious subjectivity, and said that a person\u2019s faith in his religion is obvious by his commitment to the religious doctrines, because if he believed them to be entirely true, he would act upon them without any hesitation.\n\nKierkegaard also delved into the psychology of anxiety and angst, linking it with religion. He believed that a person\u2019s most important goal in life should be creating a self which has complete faith in God, as only faith will lead him to salvation. Thus this puts a responsibility on the individual, as his choices in life will only decide whether or not he will be salvated. Such a situation fills an individual with dread and angst at every decision he takes in life, as the freedom of choice exhilarates him, while the consequence of his decisions worries him.\n\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard\u00a0passed away on the 11 November 1855. His work remained limited to Scandinavia, but the 20th century saw the revival of his philosophy, as it influenced the West everlastingly."

    "content": "Born on September 11, 1903, Thedor Ludwig Adorno was a widely recognized philosopher, social theorist, and a musicologist from Germany. Deeply influenced by Marx, Nietzsche and Hegel, Adorno wrote extensively on human suffering in the modern society. Being one of the first thinkers of the 20th century concerning modern societies and aesthetics, Adorno\u2019s works, such as the Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947), Negative Dialectics (1966) and Minima Moralia had a strong impact on the European New Left.\n\nEven before post-modernism came into fashion, Theodor Adorno, along with Horkheimer, co-wrote a detailed critique of the modern society and its depressing impact on the humans, which was titled the Dialectic of Enlightenment. The book starts with a thorough evaluation of the newly-developed West. Adorno said that enlightenment was supposed to liberate human beings from all kinds of pain and suffering, and instill in them a sense of responsibility as the masters of this world, yet it resulted in sad, ignorant people, unaware of their capabilities, rights and duties as modern individuals. Hunger, war and poverty couldn\u2019t be eradicated in the modern world, and people are mindlessly practicing and accepting fascism, production of chemical and nuclear weapons to kill off their fellow living beings on the order of others.\n\nIn the book, the two authors also gave the concept of the \u2018culture industry\u2019, a phenomenon of the modern society according to which the masses are being fed what to do, buy and consume through rigorous mass campaigning and advertising, portraying a sense of false contentment arising from following the same culture of modernity, which is in reality turning the citizens into nothing more than a mindless crowd of consumers. The production of bulk amounts of products and the pursuing of customers in order to gain high profits is what he termed as \u2018standardization\u2019. \u00a0Through accepting the standardized cultural goods-the magazines, music, television and radio programming, people are developing artificial emotional needs which can be fulfilled only through the consumption of these cultural goods, and the true psychological needs, such as creativity and freedom are neglected in the long run.\n\nProducts are advertised to give off the impression that they are custom-made for a particular individual, while in reality it is the same product thousands will purchase and consume simultaneously. \u00a0Adorno also pointed towards the issue of pop-music, where the various samples are used and re-used to create chart-topping songs which are merely slightly different copies of another, and of which none are original, individual works of music.\n\nHe differentiated between \u2018apologetic\u2019 and \u2018critical\u2019 music, apologetic being the highly produced and utilized music which can be converted into a number of tracks with slight modification. He said that such uniform music keeps the audience obedient towards the capitalist status-quo. On the other hand, critical music is the one which as a whole is greater than when it is chopped off indifferent parts, such as the brilliant works of Beethoven.\n\nAs per Adorno\u2019s translator, Robert Hullot-Kentor, all of Adorno\u2019s work revolved around the answer to the question of how our lives can be more than a question of self-sustenance and defense. Adorno believed that humans justify the sacrifice of their primitive desires and egos as a price paid to keep ourselves intact, to self-preserve.\n\nTheodor Adorno died of a heart attack on August 6, 1969 in Switzerland, while working on the great Aesthetic Theory. Adorno\u2019s greatness of thought and philosophy is accepted by all, yet he remains one of the most criticized thinkers of the modern era. Critical theorists from around the world derive their inspirations and ideas from Adorno\u2019s critique of modern societies to this day."

    "content": "Thomas Aquinas was an Italian theologian, philosopher and a very influential priest, born in the year 1225 CE. He was an important thinker of the Scholastic school of thought, where he was titled as the Doctor Communis and the Doctor Angelicus.\n\nMost of modern western philosophy stemmed as a reaction to the ideas put forward by Thomas Aquinos, especially in the realm of morality, ethics, natural law and metaphysics. The complete works of Thomas Aquinas are classified as a distinct philosophy namely \u2018Thomism\u2019. He was one of the first few thinkers who fully advocated natural theology.\n\nDespite sharp criticism of Aristotle\u2019s philosophy by the Church of his time, he fully embraced Aristotle\u2019s views and called him \u2018the Philosopher\u2019. He further worked to find a common ground between Aristotle\u2019s philosophy and the teachings of the Church. He wrote various commentaries on the Aristotelian philosophy, such as Nicomachean Ethics, Metaphysics, and On the Soul.\n\nAccording to Aquinas, a human can gain knowledge when divine guidance is bestowed upon him. That does not imply that human beings lack the capability and the capacity to learn new things, in fact humans are able to make full use of their capabilities to learn various new things without any divine help, but the truths about faith and belief can be learned only through divine revelation.\n\nHe put forward his concept of virtue, classifying them into two types: cardinal and theological. The cardinal or the natural type of virtue includes temperance, prudence, fortitude and justice. The three theological virtues are hope, faith and charity. He further explained as to what classifies as complete and perfect virtue. Any virtue with charity becomes complete; a cardinal virtue becomes perfect through charity.\n\nThomas differentiated between four different kinds of law, namely Natural, Human, Divine and Eternal. The decree of God without which His creation cannot be governed is the Eternal law. This law cannot be changed or understood by mortals without understanding the Supreme Reason. The logic which is applied to the Eternal law in order to understand it is called the Natural law. Natural law is based on a vital principle: good is to be promoted and evil is to be eradicated. \u00a0Laws created for further determination of natural phenomena with the help of scientific efforts and critical observations are called Human laws. It is the law applied by the government on societies so as to control them.\n\nThe commandments sent to us directly by God through religious scriptures are what constitute the Divine law.\n\nTowards the economic aspect of the society, Thomas contributed by giving the principles of honesty and justice. The price of a commodity should be enough to cover the cost of its production and marketing, and should not be increased unreasonably just because that commodity is in large demand by the consumers.\n\nAquinas held the belief that human beings are formed of a single material, where soul is its form, without which the material body is \u2018human\u2019 only in analogous terms. The actual, awake human comprises of both the soul and the body. After death, the human body perishes, but the soul continues to exist long after the death of the body.\n\nIn his Summa theology, Thomas defines the nature of the soul as life\u2019s first principal. It is immaterial, and an act done by the body. It is independent of the body, and it is this independency which differentiates soul from other forms found in matter.\n\nThomas Aquinas has been given the honor of being titled as a Saint by the Church. He is also famously called the Doctor of the Church. He died on 7 March 1274, in Fossa Nuova. His hymns and theological philosophy are to be studied mandatorily by the students of Christianity and those seeking to be deacons and priests. He remains one of the most important theologians and philosophers of our times."

    "name": "Thomas Hobbes",

    "content": "Thomas Hobbes was\u00a0a renowned English philosopher and political scientist. Born in Wiltshire, England, on April 5 1588, he also contributed largely to ethics, morality, history, geometry and physical sciences.\n\nIdeas presented by Hobbes are vividly unique. Being the father of modern western political philosophy, he scrutinized the formation of societies and governments, saying that humans willfully hand over their independence to an unquestionable authority, in order to gain safety and stability. The dangers of a solitary, independent life are too great not to compromise our liberty for, as per Hobbes.\n\nIn his most famous work, Leviathan, Hobbes presented his theory of social contract, on which most of the Western political philosophy is based. He termed a society without a central authority as the \u2018state of nature\u2019, and said that it was dangerous, nasty and poor. It is a state where humans are not obliged to fulfill any basic rights of others, and where self-defense takes priority above everything else, which results in destruction, chaos and disorder.\n\nThis anarchic situation resulted in a social contract, where humans gave up some of their rights, such as absolute freedom, in order to gain safety from each other. They accepted a ruler above them, who would ensure that every individual follows this contract, and this led to the formation of societies and sovereign states. Laws were made to protect the citizens and control the society. Life was not \u2018a war of all against all\u2019 anymore.\n\nAnother dilemma resulted from the emerging state-system: there is no central authority to rule above the sovereign states to regulate their interactions, resulting in wars and disputes among states.\n\nThe social contract theory forms the basis of realism, and has influenced a number of political scientists and theorists of international relations, such as Hans Morgenthau and E.H Carr.\n\nHobbes believed monarchy to be the most suitable form of government, one which guarantees peace as it can solve disputes among citizens, and between state and religion. To Hobbes, any form of government is better than no government at all, as it could lead to civil war. If all individuals submit unanimously to a central figure, conflict can be avoided. Thus, obedience is the key in Hobbes\u2019s ideal form of government.\n\nEven though he was in favor of absolute sovereignty of the authority, he also championed the rights of the citizens: equality, the right to choose their ruler, and varying interpretations of law so as to practice freely what is not clearly forbidden by the law.\n\nOn the issue of morality, Hobbes believed that circumstances decide what is right and wrong. In the state of nature, ethics do not exist. Humans are free to do what they believe is right in the given situation, when they are not ruled upon by a central authority. In a ruling state however, the ruler would decide the morals and ethics of the citizens. This directly leads to an autocratic form of government as Hobbes\u2019s ideal: a state which would even decide between the right and wrong for its citizens.\n\nHobbes deemed human observation and judgment skills as faulty and unreliable. He has various reasons to prove his point. Hobbes stated that every situation has a different effect on the person experiencing it. The state of mind, the pleasure and pain, and the beliefs instilled in a human prior to the situation come together to give a completely new perspective on the observation and the resulting judgment of that situation by a person. \u00a0For Hobbes, the one true judge for all situations and experiences should be science and physical methods, as it is reliable and consistent.\n\nAs per Hobbes, there is always going to be a certain amount of bad in our societies, and it is up to us and the states as to how we tackle it. Thomas Hobbes died on 4 December 1679. His philosophy is one based on reality, and it has shaped many of our political truths."

    "content": "Thomas Jefferson was\u00a0one of the most important political figures of American history. Born on April 13, 1743, he was a founding father of America, the creator of the Declaration of Independence, and the third president to serve the United States of America. He also founded the Democratic-Republican Party, as opposed to Alexander Hamilton\u2019s Federalism.\n\nIn addition to being the most important political leader of America, he also delved into the fields of arts, sciences and architecture. He is known for designing his own mansion, the Monticello, and the buildings of University of Virginia, which he had founded. He was a prolific writer, having written various books and thousands of letters in his lifetime. \u00a0Philosophy was one of his many feats, as he served as a member and later as the president of the American Philosophical Society. \u00a0He was a life-centered philosopher, as he closely observed and reflected on nature in all its forms: humans, geography, geology, plantations, populations and societies.\n\nJefferson, being the principal classical liberal in America, authored the vital political doctrines in the Declaration of Independence, upon which the American Democracy stands today. As the third president of United States, he nearly doubled the expansion of America, readying the nation for launching it as a super power.\n\nPolitically, Jefferson was highly influenced by Isaac Newton, John Locke, and Francis Bacon. He strongly believed in fulfilling the rights of all human beings. For Jefferson, the right form of government is the one which not only prohibits one individual from violating the right of liberty of the other, but itself does not breach the liberty of all its citizens. For Jefferson, love is similar a force to gravity: a source of attraction between two individuals. However, dependency taints the true nature of love, resulting in social and political problems. \u00a0By eliminating the systems of dependency, such as banking or political influences, one can help in creating a just world, where all humans are treated equally.\n\nDuring his term as the third president of the United States, he worked greatly towards striking a balance of power shared between the states and the centre. He was in favor of granting greater power to the states, as he believed that rights of citizens especially that of liberty and freedom, can be fulfilled in a better manner in small harmonized societies.\n\nFor Jefferson, democracy is a form of expression of the society. He called for self-determination, public education for the males, and a cultural uniformity of the nation in order to bring out the true feeling of democracy in America. He also emphasized on the freedom of media, alongside public education, as he thought that without knowledge and access to information, the nation will remain unsafe.\n\nJefferson also strived for the separation of religion and the state. Personally, he had lost faith in the conventional religion, and derived his morals from classical literature. Politically, he was against the adoption of an official religion by the state, while he also championed the right of freedom of religion and association for all citizens.\n\nThomas Jefferson is hailed as one of the most central persons behind the American Revolution. He died on July 4, 1826. He is regarded as the symbol of equality, liberty and the democratic rights of individuals, not just in America, but worldwide."

    "content": "Thomas Samuel K\u00fchn was a well-renowned philosopher of science belonging to the twentieth century. He was born on July 18, 1922, in Ohio. Having obtained his PhD in physics from the prestigious Harvard University, he taught both physics and philosophy at the Universty of California. His shift of interest, from science to the history and philosophy behind development of scientific thought proved crucial for the publication of his most celebrated work, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.\n\nHaving being asked to teach a course on history of science, K\u00fchn grew deeply interested in the processes by which a new theory replaces the older one, while both of them had been proven true at their respective times. He approached the matter in a systematic way, dividing the problem into two parts. Firstly, why scientific theories are accepted, and secondly, why they are replaced by new theories.\n\nAs a solution to the two-fold problem, K\u00fchn proposed the concept of a \u2018paradigm\u2019 in the famous 1962 book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.\n\nHe debated about the development of scientific ideas, and said that a breakthrough scientific idea of theory undergoes various stages. \u201cNormal Science\u201d is the stage where scientists solve day-to-day technological problems. The everyday puzzles of science are tackled by the scientists under a ruling paradigm. The paradigm is a major achievement or a model theory, such as Newton\u2019s Gravitational law, or Einstein\u2019s mass-energy relationship, which acts as a guide for the scientists, through which they derive other theories and scientific inspirations. A paradigm is not a strict set of rules which are followed word for word, but rather a light which shows the path of finding the answer to the puzzle, which is considered to be solvable under that paradigm\n\nThe next stage, the stage of anomaly, arises when an everyday scientific puzzle fails to be solved according to the ruling paradigm. This unsolved puzzle cannot be neglected as an incorrect research project, as various scientists are unable to to solve the problem.\n\nThe period of crisis follows this stage of anomaly, during which new methods of research are welcomed and new approaches are made towards solving the problem. Even older methods which were deemed incorrect are employed in hopes of cracking the code.\n\nLuckily, one of the new methods prove successful in solving the puzzle, and a shift in the ruling paradigm occurs. This new method serves as a stepping stone towards a scientific revolution. The new method becomes the reigning paradigm, until another anomaly arises, leading to yet another paradigm-shift.\n\nK\u00fchn further said that paradigm shifts cannot be judged solely by scientists; they are \u2018incommensurable\u2019. Only with the help of philosophers and historians of science can they be distinguished clearly.\n\nK\u00fchn\u2019s theory of paradigm shift did not remain limited to the field of science. It was extended and applied to diverse fields of study, such as political science, sociology, economics, and even business studies. The term \u2018paradigm-shift\u2019 is also embraced and utilized by the English language.\n\nIn order to honor the works of Thomas K\u00fchn, a Paradigm Shift Award is also presented by the American Chemical Society to people who present fresh, original scientific ideas which may be contrary to popular scientific theories.\n\nA collection of essays related to the philosophy and history of science penned by K\u00fchn were published in 1977, under the title The Essential Tension. In 1978, he published the monograph Blackbody Theory and Quantum Discontinuity, his take on the history of quantum mechanics.\n\nThomas K\u00fchn died on June 17, 1996. The world will remain forever in debt of his contributions towards the philosophy of scientific development and the process behind a scientific revolution."

    "content": "Uppaluri Gopala Krishnamurti, famous around the world as simply U. G Krishnamurti, gave the world a unique perspective about enlightenment. According to Krishnamurti, there is no such thing as philosophical enlightenment. There are no philosophical questions to be asked and no intellectual answers to be given to those questions.\n\nThis enlightenment-negating thinker was born in India, on July 9, 1918. For him, the concept of seeking the ultimate truth is absurd, as he thinks there is nothing to seek. Nature will provide individuals with the solutions of all their problems; one just needs to embrace it in its entirety.\n\nMany people also tried to regard him amongst the \u2018enlightened ones\u2019, but he insisted that he simply exists in what he called the \u2018natural state\u2019. For him, the puzzling notions and ideas that people involve themselves into in the name of enlightenment are the only hindrance between them and being enlightened-if there is such a thing.\n\nFor Krishnamurti, the need to constantly change, to evolve, is not just impossible, but also a futile exercise. He emphasized on the body and the soul being perfect the way they are. To try to alter bodily actions is considered by him as a breach in the purity, peace and harmony of the body.\n\nHis\u00a0concept of the mind and the psyche is only one of a kind. He believed that the psyche, or the mind, does not exist as a being, but rather it is a demand of the self to bring about a change in this world, or in itself. Self-consciousness for Krishnamurthi is a fascist force, one which only emphasizes on its own importance.\n\nAccording to Krishnamurti, the business of gurus and spiritual healers is booming because of people who are in search of answers to their pseudo questions of enlightenment and salvation. The quest for these answers is instilled into them through an artificially created cultural environment. The culture demands from people to conform while at the same time it asks them to be unique and special in their own way, infusing in people a constant need for so-called enlightenment which would bring out their exclusive character. The gurus take advantage of this situation and promise of a way towards salvation, a journey by the end of which the puzzled individual will find answers to all his spiritual questions, leading him to the ultimate truth.\n\nFor him, the goal of enlightenment is unapproachable, and self realization is futile, because there are no goals and there is nothing to discover in the self. Whatever is happening in the world is just happening; there are no divine interventions and spiritual, mysterious connections behind the happenings of the world. He liked to call himself \u2018unrational\u2019, as he totally negated the idea of employing rationality to answer questions of enlightenment. He believed that humans are too busy trying to find the meaning behind things when there is none to be found.\n\nWith his talks and words, he tried to wipe off from the minds of his followers previous concepts and cherished truths of history and society. He asked them to start anew, forgetting what has been taught to them all their lives. He denied the existence of spirituality in India, or of communism in Russia, or liberty in America. Instead, he asked his fellows to relate nothing to nowhere.\n\nU.G. Krishnamurti died on March 22, 2007. All his life he worked towards completely erasing of the idea of questioning ones\u2019 self, so that nothing stays behind but a smoothly operational biological mechanism, working with all its natural harmony and balance."

    "content": "Fran\u00e7ois-Marie d\u2019Arouet, famous by his pen name Voltaire, was\u00a0a prominent philosopher of the Enlightenment movement of the Eighteenth century. Born on November 21 1694, Voltaire gave remarkable concepts of freedom and enlightenment. He was also a noted historian and an outspoken, witty intellectual of his times.\n\nVoltaire was not a philosopher in the strict sense of the term, though he put across new ideas and thoughts prolifically through his varied style of writing. He experimented with almost all forms of writing, including poetry, prose, letters, plays, essays, novels and even scientific works. The count of his letters reaches to 20,000, while books and pamphlets sum up to more than two thousand. Most of his books are works of satire, comprising of content sparking much controversy.\n\nOn the subject of morality, he tried to find a middle ground. In his most famous work Candide (1759), he spoke sharply against the overly optimistic philosophy of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. On the other hand, he also wrote in opposition of the pessimistic ideas regarding human evilness by Blaise Pascal. He focused on judging morality based solely on reasoning.\n\nAs a philosopher, he published the famous Philosophical Dictionary in 1764, and various other essays under the title of Encyclopedia, compiled between the years 1751-1772. He openly criticized the various sections of the French society, especially religious and political institutions.\n\nVoltaire\u2019s contribution to history cannot be neglected, as he provided a new perspective on how to record the past. Voltaire is considered to be the first person to keep track of historical events fundamentally based on culture. The Age of Louis XIV in 1751 and the Essay on Customs and Spirit of Nations published in 1756 are vital examples of his historiography capabilities.\n\nVoltaire opposed almost all religions, calling the Bible and the Quran outdated manuscripts, deeming them not as divine presents but written by mortals. His harsh criticism of religion and religious scriptures and institutions often makes him come across as an atheist. In reality, however, he was a deist; he was one of the most important advocates of deism in England and France. He did not outright reject the possibility of a supreme being, but believed that an all-knowing and all-governing deity should be found through observation and reasoning, instead of blind faith. In the Treatise on Toleration (1763), he defended the right of religious freedom for all, and said that all humans are people of the same God, thus they should not create divisions and conflicts on the basis of religion.\n\nVoltaire\u2019s political philosophy was highly inspired by the ideas given by Confucius. For him, democracy was a practice of displaying mass foolishness. \u00a0He was in favor of a sensible, responsible monarchy as form of government. For Voltaire, the provision of education to the masses would not only be favorable for the people, but also for the monarch. After observing the failure of this theory by Frederick the Great, he came to the conclusion that educating ourselves is a duty which only we can fulfill in its entirety.\n\nHe also spoke against the unfair authority of the church and the state which they exercised above the middle class, which comprised of most of the tax-paying population of the country.\n\nVoltaire died on 30 May 1778. France remembers him as a brave polemic who\u00a0was never afraid to speak his mind, in spite of fierce opposition. His ideas have remained impactful throughout the Enlightenment period and are honored around the world to this day."

    "content": "Walter Bendix Sch\u00f6nflies Benjamin was a literary critic and a writer. He was born in a wealthy Jewish family in Berlin on July\u00a015,\u00a01892. The basis of philosophy on which his essays and other writings stand is being increasingly acknowledged.\n\nBenjamin\u2019s inspirations and influences came from the critical theory of Theodor Adorno, the Marxism of Bertolt Brecht and the Jewish mysticism of Gerschom Scholem. The three schools of thought did not get mixed into an amalgam; rather Benjamin\u2019s writings seem to flow dynamically from one intellectual tradition to another. He was also occasionally funded by the Frankfurt School on the orders of Theodor Adorno.\n\nHis prose style was exceptionally different from the rest. The origins of his sentences had no ordinary formations or clear line of reasoning. Each sentence gave an\u00a0impression that it had to convey everything. His writings make him emerge as a modernist; an intellectual whose literary ideas merge with his philosophical thoughts. Logical philosophy alone cannot adequately fulfill the task of accounting for all kinds of experiences, specifically the task of self-representation.\n\nBenjamin\u2019s writings have often remained a cause of shock and awe among his contemporaries, especially due to his commentary on the history and translations of literature, and how it affects modern language. His particular interests included the history and modern language, the relation between art and the then rising technological science, as well as the effect of mass media culture.\n\nOn the history of an individual, he held the belief that each person has its own distinct history, and is not merely a setting in the big picture of life. He has his own struggles, his own standards and potentials, and thus his afterlife is dependent on his own strive against the normalization of modern society.\n\nBenjamin was also deeply interested in poetry and literature of his times. He analyzed the works of Franz Kafka, Brecht and H\u00f6lderlin. He did not merely criticize them like other contemporary critics of his time, but tried to liberate these works from the specific contexts in which they will be regarded and thus limited to in the future. This he saw as his duty as a literary critic.\n\nIn his most influential and famous book, The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, Benjamin points to a shift in the traditional production of arts and how it is being used as technical source of reproduction such as in film-making and photography. According to Benjamin, the traditional artwork had a special \u2018aura\u2019 about it as it came into being through an entire historical process. The technical reproductions of the same art lack that aura and the historical dimension specific to it.\n\nBenjamin argues that any viewer of art, when he observes art through a technical medium, turns into a disinterested judge, focusing only on the face-value of that art piece and disregarding any historical associations with it.\n\nWalter Benjamin took his own life on September 26 ,1940 at the age of 48 as he failed to flee from the Nazis. He led a rather secretive life, and only after his death most of his works got published. Collections of Benjamin\u2019s essays published posthumously include Illuminations, Reflections, The Origin of German Drama and The Arcades Project. His works impacted strongly the theories in arts, feminism, cultural studies, communications and media, philosophy and literature."

    "img": "https://www.famousphilosophers.org/philosophers/wilhelm-reich.jpg",
    "content": "Wilhelm Reich, born on 24 March 1897, was an Austrian psychologist and psychoanalyst. He was a radical figure in the history of psychiatry and belonged to the second group of psychoanalysts, among the followers of Sigmund Freud.\n\nReich attempted at tying Marxism with psychoanalysis, and stated that the condition of neurosis can be caused by physical and socio-economical conditions of a society. He pointed the reason behind neurosis specifically at what he termed as \u2018orgastic potency\u2019.\n\nThe concept of orgastic potency given by Reich meant the ability to reach an orgasm with certain psychosomatic characteristics. Orgastic potency is especially linked with the condition of the ability to love.\n\nHe deemed orgastic impotency as the primary cause behind neurosis, because the patient is unable to release all libidos during orgasm. According to Reich, libido was a biological energy and not a single person with neurosis was orgastically potent.\n\nHe coined the term in his 1927 book, The Function of the Orgasm, the manuscript of which he also presented to Sigmund Freud. Reich regarded this concept to be complimenting Freud\u2019s work on anxiety neurosis. However, Freud received his theory rather ambivalently and expressed that there was not a single cause of neurosis.\n\nThe concept was continually used by Reich later in his career as a measure of a person\u2019s mental health. For him, orgastic potency was the capability of releasing emotions from the muscles and to completely lose oneself during orgasm. This losing of self is very important for the mental health and the ability to love for a person, according to Reich, reaching orgasm should not be a physical experience but also an emotional one, as the person experiences loss of his ego.\n\nDespite Reich\u2019s strong propagation of his theory of orgastic potency, the concept remained largely unpopular among the psychoanalytic circle and was even ridiculed by his contemporaries later.\n\nReich also became subject to controversy when he started treating his patients outside the limits set by psychoanalytic methods. From 1930 onwards, he broke the rules of psychoanalysis by sitting in front of the patients, rather than behind, and also answered their questions, instead of offering them the usual prescribed response. He also communicated with his patients physically, and massaged them to make them lose their stiffness and to be at ease during treatment. Reich observed that through the massage, the memories repressed in his patients could\u00a0be retrieved, and he actually saw waves of pleasure moving through the patients\u2019 bodies whenever the therapy worked. This he termed the \u2018orgasm reflex\u2019.\n\nThis new method of psychoanalysis devised by Reich was called vegetotherapy. He first presented the principles of this therapy in his paper Psychological Contact and Vegetative Current (1934). This technique was criticized and condemned as it violated the basic regulations of psychoanalysis.\n\nAfter his promotion of sexual permissiveness gained him further criticism, he left for New York in 1939, where he presented another radical idea: Orgone energy. The term orgone is derived from organism and the orgasm, and is used to denote a form of cosmic energy which Reich discovered and which according to him others referred to as God. Orgone was a universal life force, a massless substance which is not inert in nature and is omnipresent.\n\nReich, similar to his neurosis theory, stated that the deficiency of orgone in body is the cause of many diseases, including cancer. He set up the Orgone Institute to research more about the subject and even created special \u2018orgone accumulators\u2019. These were devices that allegedly collected and stored orgone energy from the surroundings and could even cure cancer.\n\nBetween 1925 and 1933, Reich produced several noteworthy works of psychology and psychoanalysis, among which Character Analysis and Mass Psychology of Fascism gained worldwide recognition.\n\nWilhelm Reich died on November 3, 1957. He is remembered as a radical psychoanalyst of bizarre and controversial yet original concepts and ideas."

    "content": "Born on\u00a0January 11, 1842, Sir William James is known around the world as the Father of American psychology. He was an accomplished philosopher and psychologist, and received recognition for his works during his lifetime. He integrated the tightly structured ideas of his times with psychology to present original theories rich in philosophical expertise.\n\nThe study of psychology was distancing itself from philosophy and was emerging as a subject on\u00a0its own during the end of the nineteenth century. William James contributed greatly to the slow process of developing the science of the mind and established it as a study of states of human consciousness. He also published two of his major works of psychology in\u00a01890s.\n\nJames also presented the\u00a0Theory of Self in which the self is divided into two parts; namely the \u2018Me\u2019 self and the \u2018I\u2019 self. The \u2018Me\u2019 self is further broken down into the materialistic, the social, and the spiritual self.\n\nJames linked the \u2018I\u2019 category with what we call the mind, and gave it the name of Pure Ego. The \u2018I\u2019 self is essentially the thinking self. Pure Ego is what we call the soul; it is the thread linking a person\u2019s past, present and future. It is not a concept which can be studied through science, according to James.\n\nThe material self is what physically constitutes a human being. It foremost includes the body. The attire, family and money are also included in the material self of a person. The social self is a person\u2019s behavior which he takes up during various social situations. The more social situations he is put in, the more social selves he is able to possess. Lastly, the spiritual self is what we truly are at our core. It includes our personality, moral values, ethics and nature. It is permanent; taking care of the spiritual self is far more rewarding than the material and the social self.\n\nThe Theory of Self raised questions about mindful actions and decisions a person makes throughout his life, which compelled him to delve into philosophy. There he studied the truth of ideas not abstractly, but in the concrete results they give, and applied it in the fields of metaphysics, religions, and social philosophy. This study resulted in the development of a philosophical school of thought called Pragmatic Epistemology.\n\nAlong with Charles Sanders Peirce and John Dewey, William James is considered to be the founder of Pragmatism. The pragmatists believe in the actual effectiveness of ideas and function of a thought should be to describe what already is there. According to Pragmatism, language, knowledge and ideas should be studied for practical usage and problem solving.\n\nJames spoke extensively on the subject. The collection of lectures titled under Pragmatism is valued as the most powerful book of American philosophy. He applied pragmatism to the concept of truth and said only those concepts should be considered true which corresponds with real things and are thus of some use.\n\nHe further said that the truthfulness of a concept can be gauged by its purposefulness. A belief is proved right by the role it plays in guiding human beings throughout their lives, and the outcomes it gives. This he called the \u2018cash value\u2019 of an idea.\n\nAnother famous theory of James is the theory of emotion. It is often assumed that the human mind perceives a situation, develops an emotion first, which then results in a bodily response. However, he\u00a0argues that we first react unconsciously to the situation through physical actions, and then form an emotion corresponding to them.\n\nThe most significant of William James\u2019s works include the Essays in Radical Empiricism, Principles of Psychology, and Psychology: The Briefer Course. He died on August 26, 1910. It is through his efforts that the philosophical world gained a new branch, and psychology became what it is now."

According to his own account of his conversion, he converted to Christianity \u201cafter he looked inside his own heart and saw only darkness and selfishness\u201d. Craig said that he experienced a maniacal psychological state, where he believed he felt the presence of the Holy Spirit. He felt as if he was \u201cborn again\u201d, however, he did not stop smoking marijuana, and is an active speaker on how marijuana is not antithetical to his profession as a Christian apologist.\n\nCraig enrolled at the evangelical protestant Wheaton College, where he pursued his Bachelors of Arts degree. Later, he received his Master of Divinity summa cum laude from the Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois. He received a Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of Birmingham and a Ph.D. in Theology from the University of Munich. In 1980, he was offered a position at the Trinity College, where he taught Philosophy of Religion for the next six years. In 1987, he decided to move to Brussels, Belgium, where he\u00a0was employed at Talbot until 1994. Later, Craig devoted his time to conducting research at the Catholic University of Louvain.\n\nCraig\u2019s fame is accredited for his development of the Kalam Cosmological argument, which proposes that there is a cause for everything and that Jesus is the \u201clight\u201d. Craig developed two more arguments to support the existence of God, The Teleological or Design Argument and The Objective Moral Values Argument. Craig is famous for his remarkable debating skills, which present the most complex phenomena in the most comprehensive and logical manner. Craig believes that the universe was created to serve a purpose by an All-Powerful, higher entity, and the purpose was forming love and relationships of compassion and kindness.\n\nCraig has made several literary contributions on a wide range of diverse topics including theology, the Christian church, Christian apologetics, metaphysics, epistemology, history, philosophy of science and cosmology among others. He has published around 30 books, some of his widely read and praised publications include \u201cThe Kalam Cosmological Argument; Assessing the New Testament Evidence for the Historicity of the Resurrection of Jesus\u201d, \u201cDivine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom\u201d, \u201cTheism\u201d, \u201cAtheism\u201d,\u00a0 \u201cBig Bang Cosmology\u201d and \u201cGod, Time and Eternity\u201d among others. Craig has also been a major contributor to a number of notable professional and academic journals such as The Journal of Philosophy, New Testament Studies, Journal for the Study of the New Testament, American Philosophical Quarterly, Philosophical Studies, Philosophy, and British Journal for Philosophy of Science."
