                "temperament": "What the Affenpinscher lacks in size, he makes up for with his big personality. He\u2019s curious and funny, bold and outgoing. His intelligence and courage make him a great watchdog, but socialization with people and other animals is crucial. As a moderately active dog, the Affen needs plenty of playtime and interaction indoors, plus outdoor walks and activities. He gets along well with other dogs, but may not do well in homes where rodents like hamsters and gerbils are kept as pets. Although playful and entertaining, the Affenpinscher does not enjoy being hugged, squeezed or chased. As such, he\u2019s not the best dog breed for families with young children. Affenpinschers are sturdy, yet compact dogs. They have a medium frame and their height and length are about the same, with females slightly longer than males. This creates a square appearance. 12 to 15 years Affenpinschers sport a variety of different coat colors, including black, gray, silver, red, black and tan, and beige. As with most breeds, Affens shed seasonally. They have a dense, wiry, medium-length coat. Brush the coat two to three times per week to prevent mats and tangles. The wiry coat is considered hypoallergenic, so the Affenpinscher may be a good dog for people with allergies. Affenpinschers are a generally healthy breed. Responsible breeders screen for certain health conditions, however. These may include luxating patella, heart and vision problems and hip dysplasia. Like other breeds with short faces, Affens may have trouble breathing in hot weather. It\u2019s important to prevent them from getting overheated. Although their small size makes them a great companion for small apartments, Affens may be prone to weight gain. This makes regular exercise and monitoring their caloric intake important. Because the Affenpinscher is a toy breed, we recommend choosing a dog food specifically formulated for small dogs. If you have an Affen puppy, choose a puppy-specific formula with essential nutrients for growth and development. For information on how much or when to feed your Affen dog or puppy, explore our feeding articles here. The Affen\u2019s origins date back to the 1600s in Munich and elsewhere in Germany. The breed started by working in stables, ridding them of pests. Later, they were brought indoors to chase mice out of kitchens. As the breed further developed, the Affenpinscher\u2019s size was decreased to transform him into a companion dog. The breed may have influenced the development of other European breeds, including the Brussels Griffon and Miniature Schnauzer. The Berlin Lapdog Club began formulating breed standards for the Affenpinscher in 1902, but the standards weren\u2019t finalized until 1913. Affens were officially recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1936, although clubs dedicated to the breed formed in France and Germany in the late 1800s. As with many breeds, World War II halted further breeding. Interest in the breed returned in the 1950s, but the Affen didn\u2019t gain widespread attention until 2002. That year, Super Nova won the Toy Group at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. In 2013, Banana Joe won Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.",

In spite of this, he\u2019s sweet and can even be silly\u2014especially as a puppy. Afghans are loyal to their immediate human family, but may snub guests. As an active breed, Afghans need plenty of exercise and adequate nutrition to fuel their high energy levels. Bred to hunt and chase prey by sight, this sighthound has strong instincts to run after anything it deems as prey. Even with consistent training, it\u2019s not advised to walk an Afghan off-leash. Outdoor play areas should have a high, secure fence. They need plenty of room to run at full speed to burn off pent-up energy. Afghans have an athletic body with protruding hipbones. This unique breed trait does not mean the dog is underweight. Instead, the hip joints pivot, which gives them the ability to cover a lot of ground quickly and overcome obstacles with ease. Their large paw pads serve as shock absorbers, protecting their joints from harsh terrain. 12 to 14 years The Afghan Hound comes in an array of different colors, including black, black and silver, black and tan, blue, blue and cream, red, silver or white. Afghans may also have markings such as a black mask, brindle, brindle black mask, brindle domino or domino. Although they require more grooming than other breeds, this long-coated breed doesn\u2019t shed much. Afghan puppies require little maintenance, thanks to their short coats. The long coat that develops during adolescence needs regular grooming. Daily brushing helps keep the coat tangle- and mat-free and removes dirt and debris. Regular bathing is also needed. Afghan Hounds have lower stores of body fat than other breeds, which makes them more sensitive to anesthesia. Experts recommend finding a veterinarian experienced with sighthounds if your Afghan needs surgery. Their deep chest increases the risk of bloat, a sudden and often life-threatening swelling of the abdomen. Responsible breeders screen for hip, eye and thyroid problems. The Afghan\u2019s long-hanging ears increases the risk of ear infection. Active breeds like the Afghan Hound can benefit from high-protein dog food to support their high energy levels.

The Afghan Hound is one of the oldest purebred dogs. So old, in fact, it was developed thousands of years before written records were kept. The breed\u2019s origins have been traced back to areas of Afghanistan, India and Pakistan, but it\u2019s impossible to pinpoint an exact region due to its lengthy history. Afghans were hunting companions to Asia\u2019s elite mountain kingdoms. They hunted large prey, both in the desert and mountains. They were prized for the ability to hunt without human direction. Although a fixture in ancient Eastern cultures, Afghan Hounds weren\u2019t discovered by Western cultures until the 1800s. English officers traveling home from time spent in the far-reaches of the British Empire brought the breed back to Europe with them. By the 1900s, Afghan Hounds were the breed of choice among Britain\u2019s upper classes.

Afghan Hounds have lower stores of body fat than other breeds, which makes them more sensitive to anesthesia. Experts recommend finding a veterinarian experienced with sighthounds if your Afghan needs surgery. Their deep chest increases the risk of bloat, a sudden and often life-threatening swelling of the abdomen. Responsible breeders screen for hip, eye and thyroid problems. The Afghan\u2019s long-hanging ears increases the risk of ear infection. Active breeds like the Afghan Hound can benefit from high-protein dog food to support their high energy levels. If you have an Afghan puppy, look for puppy food specifically formulated with essential nutrients to support his growth and development throughout his first year of life.

The Afghan Hound is one of the oldest purebred dogs. So old, in fact, it was developed thousands of years before written records were kept. The breed\u2019s origins have been traced back to areas of Afghanistan, India and Pakistan, but it\u2019s impossible to pinpoint an exact region due to its lengthy history. Afghans were hunting companions to Asia\u2019s elite mountain kingdoms. They hunted large prey, both in the desert and mountains. They were prized for the ability to hunt without human direction. Although a fixture in ancient Eastern cultures, Afghan Hounds weren\u2019t discovered by Western cultures until the 1800s. English officers traveling home from time spent in the far-reaches of the British Empire brought the breed back to Europe with them. By the 1900s, Afghan Hounds were the breed of choice among Britain\u2019s upper classes. The American Kennel Club (AKC) first registered the breed in 1927, but it didn\u2019t gain popularity in the U.S. until the 1930s. The Afghan Hound went on to win Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1957 and again in 1983.",

Akita dogs will thrive on a complete and balanced dry or wet dog food. Akitas may also benefit from a high-protein formula to support a healthy, active lifestyle. Of course, Akita puppies need a complete and balanced puppy food for the first year of life. For information on how much or when to feed your Akita dog or puppy, explore our feeding articles here. The Akita\u2019s ancestry dates back to the early 17th century. In the prefecture of northern Japan where the breed gets its name, a competition was held to create a versatile hunting dog. Over time, the Akita was used to hunt big game like wild boar, elk and even bears. Ownership of these imposing hunters was once restricted to members of the Imperial family and their court. The breed nearly went extinct several times over the course of its long history, and a national breed club in Japan eventually formed to help ensure the Akita\u2019s longevity. After World War II, American soldiers brought these dogs back to the States with them. It wasn\u2019t until 1972, however, that the breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC).",

The Australian Shepherd has a waterproof, double-layer coat that requires weekly brushing sessions. During shedding season, they require more brushing with an undercoat rake to remove dead hair. Australian Shepherds are a generally healthy breed, but they do have some health concerns, including hip dysplasia, epilepsy, cataracts and certain forms of cancers.

The loyal Basset is an exceptional scenthound used to hunt small to medium-sized game, including rabbits, birds, fox and deer. Despite his charming qualities, the Basset Hound is stubborn and strong-willed, which can make training difficult. Early, regular training and socialization from puppyhood can help overcome this obstacle. Basset Hounds are easily recognized by their short legs, long, droopy ears and soulful eyes. The short legs and longer body move effortlessly, but the Basset is not necessarily fast. 12 to 13 years Bassets can be a wide range of colors, including black and white; black, brown and white; black, tan and white; black, white and brown; black, white and tan; brown, black and white; lemon and white; mahogany and white; and red and white. As moderate shedders, grooming Bassets several times a week will help keep it under control. The Basset Hound has a high risk of obesity. He also has a higher risk for ear infections, hip and elbow dysplasia, bleeding disorders, glaucoma, hypothyroidism and luxating patella. Responsible breeders screen their stock for such conditions to help produce the healthiest Bassets possible. Adult Basset Hounds will do well on a complete and balanced dog food. Basset Hound puppies should eat a complete and balanced puppy food for their first year of life. Puppy food has all the essential nutrients Bassets need for their growth and development. The Basset Hound hails from France and Belgium. The breed is thought to be a cross of older French breeds by friars. Bassets were bred to be scenthounds who could lead hunters by foot to prey such as rabbit and deer. Their accuracy as scenthounds made them a popular breed among the French aristocracy.",

Beagles may be one of the oldest dog breeds, but their origin is a bit of a mystery, as is their name. Some experts speculate \u201cBeagle\u201d comes from the Gaelic word \u201cbeag\u201d which means \"little\". Others presume the breed was named after the sound they make while hunting: \u201cbe\u2019geule\u201d in French. Small pack-hounds were employed to hunt rabbit and hare in England before 55 B.C. By the 1500s, most English gentlemen had Beagles as hunting companions. They used larger hounds to track deer and smaller hounds to track hares. The modern-day Beagle is an ancestor of the smaller version of the breed. Beagles are known as \u201cfoot hounds,\u201d meaning they track on foot without needing a horse, making them popular among those who couldn\u2019t afford to feed and stable horses or had difficulties riding horseback. The breed was imported to America after the Civil War and was popular amongst U.S. rabbit hunters. Beagles were registered with the American Kennel Club in 1885.",
                "colors": "Beagles are commonly tri-color (black, tan and white), but their coats also come in combinations of black, tan, red, white, brown, lemon, blue and redtick. The Beagle's smooth, dense double coat gets heavier during the winter and sheds in the summer. They also shed moderately throughout the year. Responsible breeders screen the Beagle breed for conditions like hip dysplasia, hypothyroidism, epilepsy, luxating patella and eye disorders. When it comes to choosing the best dog food for your Beagle, it\u2019s important to take his or her unique breed traits into consideration. As an active breed, they may benefit from sport performance formula, but provided their food is completed and balanced, they'll\u00a0 get the nutrition they need to be healthy. Food for Beagles can include: When choosing a food for your Beagle puppy, remember puppies of any breed have specific nutritional needs during their time of development. A formula containing DHA nourishes brain and vision development and rich in antioxidants supports their developing immune system to help them thrive during their first year of life.

Though the Bernese Mountain Dog is not an outdoor dog, he loves going on outdoor adventures like long walks or hikes to satisfy his need for moderate daily exercise. The Berner is smart and eager to please, which can make obedience training easier. As a large breed, the Bernese Mountain Dog was built to work. Though the body is sturdy, his sweet temperament is evident in his soft features, including big brown eyes. 7 to 10 years Berners are easily recognized by the black, white and rust tri-color markings on their face and coat. The Berner\u2019s long, thick coat protects him in cold conditions, but sheds throughout the year. A Berner will shed more heavily during the spring shedding season. Daily brushing, particularly during those seasons, will help remove the loose hair. As with other large breeds, Bernese Mountain Dogs are at risk of bloat, a life-threatening condition. Other health conditions Berners may develop include hip and elbow dysplasia, certain cancers and blood disorders. Responsible breeders screen for such health conditions. Because the Bernese Mountain Dog is a large dog, he\u2019ll benefit from a large breed dog food. Large breed formulas offer additional support for healthy joints and mobility. A Berner puppy can also benefit from a large breed puppy food, which has all the nutrients he\u2019ll need for healthy growth and development in his first two years of life. The Bernese Mountain Dog originated on Swiss farms where he worked as a cattle drover, draft dog and guardian. Despite their hard work and gentle companionship after the workday, the Berner\u2019s numbers were in serious decline by the end of the 19th century. Professor Albert Heim led a Swiss breed club in 1907 in an effort to preserve the Bernese Mountain Dog. By 1926, the breed made its way to the U.S. by way of a Kansas farmer. The breed\u2019s popularity took off and the American Kennel Club (AKC) registered their first Berner in 1937.",

Because the Bernese Mountain Dog is a large dog, he\u2019ll benefit from a large breed dog food. Large breed formulas offer additional support for healthy joints and mobility. A Berner puppy can also benefit from a large breed puppy food, which has all the nutrients he\u2019ll need for healthy growth and development in his first two years of life. The Bernese Mountain Dog originated on Swiss farms where he worked as a cattle drover, draft dog and guardian. Despite their hard work and gentle companionship after the workday, the Berner\u2019s numbers were in serious decline by the end of the 19th century. Professor Albert Heim led a Swiss breed club in 1907 in an effort to preserve the Bernese Mountain Dog. By 1926, the breed made its way to the U.S. by way of a Kansas farmer.

Not only does their coat resemble a tuxedo, but they are also a proper, well-mannered breed. These canines also have a natural gift for comedy. The Boston Terrier makes a great urban pet, being sturdy, portable and people-oriented. Some Boston Terriers love to run and play to let off steam, while others are fine with one brisk walk a day. These feisty little dogs can get frustrated and bored when left alone for too long. They prefer playing a game of fetch with their beloved human. Some enjoy canine sports like agility, obedience, flyball and rally. When training, remember Boston Terriers are quite sensitive, so focus on giving praise and gentle correction. 11 to 13 years Most Boston Terriers are black and white, but their coats can also be brindle or seal with white markings. The Boston Terrier\u2019s sleek, fine coat sheds minimally. The Boston Terrier\u2019s eyes can cause problems for the breed, so check them daily for redness or irritation.

                "characteristics": "Boston Terriers are known as The American Gentleman and for good reason. Not only does their coat resemble a tuxedo, but they are also a proper, well-mannered breed. These canines also have a natural gift for comedy. The Boston Terrier makes a great urban pet, being sturdy, portable and people-oriented. Some Boston Terriers love to run and play to let off steam, while others are fine with one brisk walk a day. These feisty little dogs can get frustrated and bored when left alone for too long. They prefer playing a game of fetch with their beloved human. Some enjoy canine sports like agility, obedience, flyball and rally. When training, remember Boston Terriers are quite sensitive, so focus on giving praise and gentle correction. 11 to 13 years Most Boston Terriers are black and white, but their coats can also be brindle or seal with white markings. The Boston Terrier\u2019s sleek, fine coat sheds minimally. The Boston Terrier\u2019s eyes can cause problems for the breed, so check them daily for redness or irritation. They can also experience patellar luxation and, like other flat-faced breeds, can have a hard time breathing in excessive heat or humidity. When it comes to choosing the best dog food for your Boston Terrier, it\u2019s important to take his or her unique breed traits into consideration. Since Boston Terriers are on the small side, a dog food formulated for small breeds is a smart choice to maintain their ideal body condition.

Although he\u2019s patient and protective of children, he\u2019s wary of strangers and fearless when threatened. Boxers have an athletic build and a wrinkled, expressive forehead when alert. 10 to 12 years Standard breed colors are fawn or brindle with white markings. The Boxer\u2019s short coat requires little grooming and sheds on occasion. Boxers have a risk for various health conditions, including hip dysplasia, heart conditions, thyroid deficiencies and certain cancers. Responsible breeders screen regularly for such conditions to help develop a healthy breed. Additionally, Boxers do not do well in extreme heat or cold, so be mindful of this when exercising a Boxer outdoors. An adult Boxer will thrive on a high-protein dog food to support his high energy levels and active lifestyle.

They are excellent watchdogs, with personality and devotion that makes them a charming companion for adults.\u00a0\nActive indoors, the Brussels Griffon can live comfortably in an apartment but still needs daily walks. Members of the Toy group, Brussels Griffons are distinguished by their almost human faces. With their large eyes, short muzzles, and scruffy beards and mustaches, they look like comically serious little men. 12 to 15 years The Brussels Griffon\u2019s coat can be beige, black, black and tan, or red. Brussels Griffons can be either rough or smooth coated.\u00a0\nSmooth-coated Griffons shed seasonally, usually for a week or two in spring and fall, and should be brushed daily during these times. This, plus an occasional bath will keep smooth-coated Griffs well groomed.\u00a0\nRough-coated Griffons do not shed. Their coat, with the exception of their trademark beards, are usually clipped short by their owner or a groomer. Brussels Griffons are generally healthy dogs, thanks in part to responsible breeders who screen for issues such as heart problems, cataracts, patella luxation and hip dysplasia. Because of their flat faces, Griffons usually snore and can be prone to breathing problems in hot or humid weather. As a toy breed, Brussels Griffons may find the specialized nutrition and smaller kibble of a toy breed or small breed dog food beneficial.

Friendly and affectionate, this energetic, well-muscled breed needs daily exercise. This robust Terrier group breed is muscular and big-boned, with a unique, egg-shaped head accentuated by pointed ears and small, mischievous eyes. Powerful and agile, they walk with a cheerful gait that showcases their outgoing personality. A happy Bull Terrier is one who receives early socialization with dogs and people, loving but firm training, lots of exercise and of course, time with his favorite people. A properly nurtured Bull Terrier is the most loving, loyal companion a family could want. 12 to 13 years Bull Terriers sport two types of coats: white; or any other color (including brindle), either solid or with white markings. The Bull Terrier is a seasonal shedding breed. Giving his short, flat coat a weekly brushing will help to remove loose hair and dirt.

One of the breeds that resulted from this process was the Bull Terrier.\nOnce dogfighting was also banned in Britain, the Bull Terrier became a fashionable companion for young gentlemen of the mid-1800s.\u00a0\nFurther breeding increased the pleasantness of the Bull Terrier\u2019s temperament. The breed became part of the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1885 and has been a much-loved American pet since.",

The Cane Corso has a short, double-layered coat. His undercoat sheds throughout the year, with a spike in the spring. Weekly brushing during shedding season will remove dead hair before it falls out. Cani Corsi are prone to hip dysplasia, idiopathic epilepsy, demodex mange and eyelid abnormalities. Because of their large, deep chests, they are also susceptible to bloat. Since Cane Corso can weigh far more than 50 pounds at maturity, choose a large or giant breed formula to support their joint health and mobility and maintain their ideal body condition. These foods include: For an active Cane Corso, consider a formula with a protein-to-fat ratio to meet their activity level. Formulas like Purina Pro Plan SPORT 26/16 can help maintain lean muscles. Like other puppies, your Cane Corso puppy will have specific nutritional needs to aid in their growth and development during their first year of life.

This type of dog was bred by an ancient Greek tribe who needed the giant, big-boned guard dogs. At the height of the Roman Empire, the breed was brought back to Italy from the Greek Islands and bred to native Italian breeds. These offspring were likely a cross between the modern Corso and the Neapolitan Mastiff. The ancestors were fearless dogs who would charge enemy lines with buckets of flaming oil strapped to their backs. During the 5th century, Italians and their dogs found themselves out of work. The breed was adapted to civilian jobs like wild boar hunting, farming, livestock droving and guarding. In fact, they became a staple on farms and in pastures along the Italian countryside.

They thrive on companionship and get along well with children and other pets. Cavaliers are an adaptable breed, so they\u2019ll do well in active or sedentary households. As descendants of hunting dogs, they love to romp outdoors, but are also happy to curl up on their owners\u2019 laps. The Cavalier is easily recognized by his rich, soft coat and big, round eyes. 12 to 15 years Cavaliers have four distinct color variations: white with chestnut markings (known as \u201cBlenheim), white with black markings, black with tan markings and ruby, which is a rich red color. Cavaliers shed occasionally. Regular brushing is recommended to prevent tangles and matting of the medium-length coat. Like other small dogs, Cavaliers are at risk of obesity. Other health risks include eye conditions like cataracts, knee and hip problems and ear infections. They also have a higher risk for heart problems and certain neurological conditions. A Cavalier King Charles Spaniel will thrive on a complete and balanced small or toy breed dog food. These specially formulated foods are easier for small breeds to chew, thanks to the smaller kibble size. Cavalier puppies should eat a complete and balanced small or toy breed puppy food for the first year of life. Puppy formulas have added nutrients to aid a puppy\u2019s mental and physical development during this time. The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel was named for King Charles II. Toy-sized spaniels remained favorites among British nobility into the 19th century. In the Victorian age, the Cavalier was bred with Asian toy breeds like the Pug, resulting in the English Toy Spaniel (as it\u2019s known in America; in the United Kingdom, it\u2019s known as the King Charles Spaniel). The English Toy Spaniel had a flatter face and rounder skull like the Pug and over time, the Cavalier was rendered nearly extinct. In the 1920s, Roswell Eldridge, an American, offered a cash prize to any British breeder who could reproduce the classic Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, thus resurrecting the breed.",

Though he loves spending time with his owner, he does require training. Without it, this king will try to reign over the entire household. Chihuahuas make excellent city pets, as they need little exercise and enjoy spending time on their owners\u2019 laps. They are too small for the rough play of small kids, but are loyal and adaptable with many types of people, as long as they get quality time and affection. 14 to 16 years Chihuahuas come in a broad range of colors. In fact, the American Kennel Club\u2019s (AKC) standard is any color, solid, marked or splashed. The Chihuahua comes in two different varieties: smooth coat and long coat. Both types are medium shedders, with heavier shedding twice per year and moderate shedding during the rest of the year. Chihuahuas are a generally healthy breed. They can suffer from some genetic issues, however, including heart problems, eye disease, epilepsy and loose kneecaps. When adopting a Chihuahua, it\u2019s important to go to a reputable breeder. Additionally, as with all dogs, regular vet check-ups are recommended. When choosing a dog food for your Chihuahua, keep his size in mind and select a formula that will maintain his ideal body condition.

When the Aztecs conquered the Toltecs in the 12th century, they refined the breed to create the lighter, smaller Chihuahua we know today. In the mid-1800s, Americans began to take interest in the breed and named it after the Mexican state of Chihuahua, where it was commonly found.

                "temperament": "The affectionate Chow Chow is devoted and loyal to his family, but indifferent to strangers. He makes an excellent guard dog, but his independent, stubborn streak means he needs early socialization and training. Moderate daily exercise like walks or play with toys will help keep the Chow happy and healthy. The Chow has a muscular, powerful build in a fairly compact body. His signature look includes a lion\u2019s mane-like ruff of fur around his head and neck. He has a blue-black tongue, deep almond eyes and a slightly wrinkled forehead, lending to his judgmental expression. 8 to 12 years Standard Chow Chow colors include red, black, blue, cinnamon or cream. The Chow\u2019s thick double coat may be rough or smooth. Either way, it requires regular grooming. Chows shed seasonally, so brushing twice per week and more frequently during the spring shedding season will suffice. Aside from being intolerant of high heat and humidity, the Chow Chow may also suffer from hip and elbow dysplasia, eye problems, patellar luxation and thyroid disorders. Working with a responsible breeder will help avoid these health concerns. Chows will do well on a complete and balanced wet or dry dog food. Chow puppies need puppy food to get all the nutrients they need for healthy growth and development during their first year of life. The Chow Chow may be the world\u2019s oldest breed. Chows were depicted in Chinese artifacts dating back to approximately 206 BC. They spent much of their early years serving as companions to Chinese nobility. Throughout their long history, however, Chows had numerous jobs, including guarding, hauling and hunting. Chow Chow ancestors may have even been a food source for the northern Chinese. In the 1820s, Chows were part of a \u201cWild Dogs of China\u201d exhibit at the London Zoo. It wasn\u2019t until Queen Victoria acquired a Chow in the later 1800s that the breed gained popularity. Chows came to the U.S. in the 1890s and the American Kennel Club (AKC) registered its first of the breed in 1903.",

His gentle, affectionate and playful nature makes him especially good with kids. He needs daily exercise in the form of a brisk walk or playtime with his favorite people. He\u2019s a people pleaser, so he\u2019s relatively easy to train. Cocker Spaniels are the smallest of the sporting breeds. Their small bodies are sturdy, and they move with ease. They have large eyes and a long, silky coat. 10 to 14 years Cocker Spaniel coat colors include a wide variety, ranging from solid black to red and white and many other color combinations. The Cocker Spaniel is a low-shedding breed, but he requires daily brushing to prevent tangles and mats. Trimming the coat every few months will keep him looking his best. Overeating and lack of exercise can lead to weight gain and obesity in Cocker Spaniels. The breed is also at risk for hip, knee and eye problems. Responsible breeders screen for these conditions to help produce the healthiest breed possible. Their long ears require regular cleaning to reduce the risk of infection. Like other small breeds, Cocker Spaniels may benefit from a small breed dog food. For Cockers who need help losing weight, consider a healthy weight formula. Cocker Spaniel puppies should eat puppy food for their first year of life to aid in their growth and development. The Cocker Spaniel\u2019s origins trace back to Spain, where the breed got its start as bird hunters. For hundreds of years, the only difference in the categorization of the many breeds of spaniels was whether they hunted on land or in water. In the 19th century, however, this changed. The Cocker Spaniel was designated as its own breed, named for the woodcock it hunted and its Spanish origins. In the United States, the Cocker was developed into two distinct varieties: American and English. In the 1940s, the breeds were registered as two distinct breeds by the Canadian, English and American Kennel Clubs.

They\u2019re loyal and obedient, easily trained and can adapt to many living situations. Corgis are especially fond of kids and are agreeable with other pets. Corgis make better exercise buddies than they appear, as they were originally bred to drive livestock. They\u2019re fast, powerful and have impressive endurance. Their herding background means they also love having a job. Corgis are a vocal breed and vigilant guardian with a \u201cbig dog\u201d bark. They love the outdoors and thrive on mental stimulation and physical activity. Many Corgis are good at agility, obedience, herding and tracking activities. 12 to 14 years The Corgi\u2019s coat comes in a variety of colors, including black and tan, fawn, red, blue merle, brindle, grey, liver, red merle, sable merle, white merle and sable. Corgis have a double coat that sheds daily. Shedding increases during late spring/early summer. Corgis may experience health conditions such as hip dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) and degenerative myelopathy. Their \u201clong and low\u201d body style also makes them susceptible to back issues. As they age, you may need to assist them in jumping down off the bed or couch and be careful with stairs.

In fact, they\u2019re the oldest of all British breeds. Cardigans are thought to have been brought from Central Europe to Wales by the Celts around 3,000 years ago, and Corgis were driving Welsh herds 1,000 years ago. During the dog\u2019s long history, Cardigans have worked as an all-around farm dog, hunting partner, family protector and athlete. Their low-to-the-ground profile allows them to nip at the heels of cattle and avoid getting kicked, making them a great herding breed. They also serve as a flock guardian at night. Pembroke Corgis came to Britain in 1107, when Henry I invited a community of weavers to live and work in southwestern Wales. This community of master craftsmen brought with them the dogs they bred to herd cattle and sheep. Cardigans and Pembrokes were at one time interbred, until they were recognized as separate breeds after 1934.",

These funny little dogs are loyal and attached to their families. They are good with other pets, especially other Dachshunds, and make ideal house dogs. Due to their stubborn and independent nature, Dachshunds are challenging to train. The key is patience, consistency and positive, reward-based training. Additionally, they need daily walks and playtime, as loneliness and boredom can bring out undesirable behaviors like excessive barking. 12 to 16 years The most common colors of Dachshunds are red, black and tan, and tan. The breed features a wide range of solid colors and color combinations, however, including: chocolate, black, cream, wild boar, wheaten, chocolate and cream, chocolate and tan, blue and tan and fawn and tan. Additionally, their coats can feature patterns like brindle, dapple and sable. The Dachshund is available in three different varieties denoted by coat type: smooth coated, longhaired and wirehaired. Overall, Dachshunds are considered moderate shedders, however, longhaired Dachshunds may require more frequent brushing. Dachshunds are a generally healthy breed, but they are at risk for back injuries, particularly when overweight. Like most dogs with drop ears, keep the ears clean to prevent infections. When it comes to choosing the best dog food for your Dachshund, keep his unique breed traits in mind.

Once a badger was found, the unusually loud bark of the Dachshund alerted their above-ground hunting partners of their catch. Today, you may still catch a Dachshund digging furiously, or attempting to pursue prey. Because their ancestors pursued fearsome, scrappy badgers, the breed inherited the courage to take on larger, fiercer opponents. This means they aren\u2019t easily intimidated \u2013 even by much bigger dogs.",

Overall, Dachshunds are considered moderate shedders, however, longhaired Dachshunds may require more frequent brushing. Dachshunds are a generally healthy breed, but they are at risk for back injuries, particularly when overweight. Like most dogs with drop ears, keep the ears clean to prevent infections. When it comes to choosing the best dog food for your Dachshund, keep his unique breed traits in mind. Since Dachshunds are small dogs, a small breed dog food or a weight management formula can help him maintain his ideal body condition. When choosing a food for your Dachshund puppy, remember puppies of all breeds have specific nutritional needs through their first year. A formula with DHA nourishes brain and vision development and antioxidants will support their developing immune system so they grow into healthy adult dogs. The Dachshund originated in Germany in the middle ages, and was a popular badger hunter in the 1600s. Aptly named, the word Dachshund comes from the German word dach, or \u201cbadger\u201d, and hund, which means \u201cdog.\u201d The Dachshund\u2019s elongated body, short legs and sharp claws made them ideal diggers and underground hunters who could navigate the long, subterranean burrows of their prey. Once a badger was found, the unusually loud bark of the Dachshund alerted their above-ground hunting partners of their catch. Today, you may still catch a Dachshund digging furiously, or attempting to pursue prey. Because their ancestors pursued fearsome, scrappy badgers, the breed inherited the courage to take on larger, fiercer opponents. This means they aren\u2019t easily intimidated \u2013 even by much bigger dogs.",

                "temperament": "Doberman Pinschers are playful and intelligent dogs, despite their often undeserved aggressive reputation. With proper training and socialization from puppyhood, the Doberman makes an excellent and affectionate companion. A properly socialized Dobie is good with both children and other pets, though children must also be taught how to safely interact with him. As an energetic breed, the Doberman needs plenty of exercise. He\u2019ll enjoy going on long walks, runs or hikes with you and playing in a fenced-in yard. The Dobie is smart, so he learns quickly. This can make training easy initially, but he can get bored, so you\u2019ll need to find ways to keep the sessions interesting. Because he\u2019s a physically strong and strong-willed dog, proper training is essential to ensure he becomes a good canine citizen. The Dobie is muscular and athletic, with a sleek and regal appearance. Traditionally, their tails are docked and ears cropped. Dobermans have short, sleek coats. 10 to 12 years When most people think of Dobermans, they think of the traditional black coat with rust markings. Doberman coats can come in an array of colors, though, including black, blue, red, or fawn with rust markings. The rust markings are usually above the eyes, on the muzzle, throat, chest, legs, feet and under the tail. The short Dobie coat sheds moderately throughout the year. Weekly brushing helps remove loose hair and keep the coat shiny. Doberman Pinschers are a healthy breed overall. A primary concern, as with other deep-chested, large dogs, is bloat. Other genetic conditions like hip dysplasia, dilated cardiomyopathy, von Willebrand\u2019s disease, hypothyroidism and progressive retinal atrophy are also possible. Responsible breeders screen for medical conditions that could affect the dog\u2019s health. Because Dobermans are such an active breed, you may want to feed yours a high protein dog food to support his energy levels. A Doberman puppy will need a quality puppy food for the first year of his life to help him grow and develop into a healthy dog. For information on how much or when to feed your Doberman dog or puppy, explore our feeding articles here. The Doberman Pinscher originated in Germany toward the end of the 19th century. The breed is named for Louis Dobermann, a tax collector who bred the dogs to serve as protectors as he made his collection rounds. Dobies soon earned a reputation as working dogs and were used by the police and military as early as World War I. They also worked as therapy and service dogs. Dobermans made their way to the U.S. in the early 1900s and were registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1908. The Doberman Pinscher Club of America formed in 1921 and the dog is still considered one of the most popular working breeds in America.",

                "colors": "When most people think of Dobermans, they think of the traditional black coat with rust markings. Doberman coats can come in an array of colors, though, including black, blue, red, or fawn with rust markings. The rust markings are usually above the eyes, on the muzzle, throat, chest, legs, feet and under the tail. The short Dobie coat sheds moderately throughout the year. Weekly brushing helps remove loose hair and keep the coat shiny. Doberman Pinschers are a healthy breed overall. A primary concern, as with other deep-chested, large dogs, is bloat. Other genetic conditions like hip dysplasia, dilated cardiomyopathy, von Willebrand\u2019s disease, hypothyroidism and progressive retinal atrophy are also possible. Responsible breeders screen for medical conditions that could affect the dog\u2019s health. Because Dobermans are such an active breed, you may want to feed yours a high protein dog food to support his energy levels. A Doberman puppy will need a quality puppy food for the first year of his life to help him grow and develop into a healthy dog.

English Springer Spaniels are a sporting breed with a double coat, and long, luxurious ears. Their muscular bodies and smooth, efficient stride make them perfectly suited for long days of hunting fieldwork.\u00a0\nThe Springer\u2019s kind eyes convey the inherent trust of a breed born to work and live with humans. 12 to 14\u00a0years The English Springer Spaniel\u2019s coat is white in various combinations with black, tan and liver colors. English Springer Spaniels shed occasionally, but weekly brushing will help minimize this. The longer hair around the Springer\u2019s head, neck and underside can tangle if not brushed or combed regularly.\u00a0\nSpringers can also be trimmed to keep their coats neat, either by their owner or a professional groomer. The English Springer Spaniel is a healthy breed; however breeders need to watch for elbow and hip dysplasia, and eye conditions. To avoid infection, the Springer\u2019s long ears should be checked regularly. English Springer Spaniels may benefit from an adult dog food for active dogs. For Springers who need help with weight management, consider a healthy weight formula.\u00a0\nEnglish Springer Spaniel puppies should eat puppy food for their first year of life to aid in their growth and development. The English Springer Spaniel, English Cocker Spaniel and Field Spaniel didn\u2019t start as three distinct breeds. Before the generations of careful and well-planned breeding that refined the breeds we know today, English land spaniels described as \u201ccockers\u201d or \u201cspringers\u201d often arrived in the same litters.\u00a0\nThe springer-type spaniel was first used by hunters to work on game birds\u2014a reputation the English Springer Spaniel maintains to this day. These eager and intelligent gun dogs are prized for their ability to detect game, flush it, then point and retrieve the downed quarry.\u00a0\nSpringers will do this tirelessly. When a long day in the field is done, they transform from determined hunting dogs into pleasant house pets, happy to be at home with family.\u00a0\nEnglish Springers first gained fame in North America in the 1920s, when their talents as rugged yet stylish gundogs were recognized in America and Canada.

Though the German Shepherd Dog is a lovable breed, they do not give affection lightly. As a \u201cone-man\u201d breed, however, they display serious loyalty to their owner or primary caretaker. As a strong, powerful breed, it's important to socialize puppies with children (during the critical socialization window) to ensure they grow up to become a good family member. As an active breed, German Shepherd Dogs require both mental and physical exercise. Many do well with activities like agility, herding, tracking and dock diving. 7 to 10 years The German Shepherd Dog\u2019s color can vary between black, tan, solid black and solid sable. German Shepherds have a medium-length, double coat consisting of a dense, harsh and close-lying outer coat with a softer undercoat. Their coat is easy to maintain with a quick brushing every few days to remove loose hair. They shed more profusely once or twice a year. To control the shedding, brush them more frequently during these seasons. Some German Shepherd Dogs can suffer from myelopathy and elbow and hip dysplasia, but responsible breeders screen for those health conditions to develop the heathiest possible version of the breed. They may also experience bloat, a sudden and life-threatening swelling of the abdomen. Speak to your veterinarian about the signs and symptoms of bloat. Because German Shepherd Dogs can weigh more than 50 pounds at maturity, opt for a large-breed dog food to support joint health and mobility and maintain their ideal body condition. You may also want to consider foods formulated for active and energetic dogs, which offer an ideal protein-to-fat ratio to maintain lean muscles. These foods include: When choosing a food for your German Shepherd puppy, select a formula containing DHA to nourish brain and vision development and antioxidants to support their developing immune system during their first year of life. A large-breed or sport puppy formula can further support the joint health of an active, growing puppy. The following foods meet the needs of a growing puppy: The German Shepherd Dog was first bred in 1899, when a German cavalry officer made it his mission to develop the ideal German herder. Breeders crossed various strains from across the country to create the breed we know today. The breed became popular in the U.S. after the adventures of Rin-Tin-Tin and Strongheart swept theaters. The breed suffered from anti-German sentiment during and after the world wars, however. The German Shepherd Dog developed their well-known qualities of intelligence, agility, speed, stealth and firm authority in the sheep pasture.

Behind the friendly eyes of the Golden Retriever lives an intelligent mind and sweet temperament. Eager to please, Goldens are easy to train and love hearing praise when they master a new skill. Goldens are also high-energy and can perform tasks like waterfowl retrieval for hours on end. Because they were bred to assist on the hunt, keep them well exercised and busy to avoid undesirable behavior. Overall, this smart, outgoing and good-natured breed makes him a trustworthy leader in a number of fields.

Without adequate exercise, Goldens are at risk of becoming overweight. You want to select a food that will help him maintain his ideal body condition long-term. Here are a few foods that we recommend for Golden Retrievers. Puppies of all breeds have specific nutritional needs. Golden Retrievers are no exception. Because they may take more time to mature than smaller breeds, Golden Retrievers may need puppy food until 18 months to 2 years of age. Look for a puppy food formula\u00a0with DHA to nourish brain and vision development. Formulas with antioxidants will support a puppy\u2019s developing immune system. Some foods you may want to consider for your Golden Retriever puppy include: The Golden Retriever was first bred on the estate of a Scottish aristocrat named Dudley Marjoribanks, the first Lord Tweedmouth. Beginning in the 1840\u2019s Tweedmouth began breeding his \u201cYellow Retriever\u201d with the now-extinct Tweed Water Spaniel. Over time, Irish Setters and Bloodhounds were also added to the bloodline. The Golden Retriever was developed over 50 years and several generations. This \u201cideal gundog\u201d was widely admired by sport hunters and show fanciers alike who instantly appreciated the Golden for his skills on the hunt, beautiful coat and sweet temperament.",

                "temperament": "Although some toy dog breeds can be territorial and aggressive, the Havanese is happy, outgoing and friendly to humans and other animals alike. He\u2019s intelligent, easy to train and eager to please. The Havanese is an ideal family dog, as he gets along well with children. Though he\u2019s not aggressive, his keen eye makes him a good watchdog as well. To keep the spring in his step, the Havanese needs moderate exercise daily. Short walks or indoor or outdoor family playtime will help keep him happy and healthy. The Havanese is small but sturdy, with a longer body than he is tall. The breed is easily recognized by the long double coat and a tail that curls forward. Some Havanese dogs can have a corded coat with some effort. 14 to 16 years The Havanese breed includes a vast array of colors and markings. The long, potentially hypoallergenic coat does not shed but requires regular grooming to keep it tangle- and mat-free. Havanese puppies have a softer, shorter coat. Like other small breeds, the Havanese may become overweight or obese. A complete and balanced diet and daily exercise is essential to maintaining ideal body condition. The breed is generally healthy, but may be more prone to vision and hearing disorders, heart murmurs and hip and knee problems. Responsible breeders screen their stock to help eliminate these conditions. Because of the Havanese\u2019s small size, he may benefit from and even prefer a toy or small breed dog food. The smaller-sized kibble is easier for toy breeds to chew. Small or toy breed puppy food is ideal for Havanese puppies to ensure the food is not only easy to chew, but has all the essential nutrients needed for growth and development. The Havanese is a descendant of the ancient Bichon breeds, whose relatives include the Bichon Frise and Maltese. The breed\u2019s ancestors came to the island of Cuba in the 1600s, around the time the Italians and Spaniards were colonizing the new world. Originally a pampered lap dog of the island\u2019s aristocratic sugar barons, his role later evolved to include companionship, watchdog and even herding poultry. When many Cubans fled the island and Fidel Castro, they brought this toy breed with them. The breed was refined and thrived, thanks to American fanciers. It\u2019s now a popular dog worldwide.",

                "temperament": "Labrador Retrievers are everything you\u2019d expect of man\u2019s best friend. They\u2019re friendly and outgoing, devoted to their families, eager to please and easygoing, yet energetic. As an athletic breed, Labs love to swim and retrieve. They also make great search-and-rescue dogs, service dogs and drug and bomb detection dogs. Labs are a large breed with lots of energy, so it\u2019s important to socialize and train Lab puppies from an early age. Daily exercise is important to prevent a bored Labrador from resorting to destructive behaviors like excess barking or chewing to burn off pent-up energy. Labradors are sturdy dogs with a wide head, tapered tail and a dense, water-repellant double coat. 10 to 12 years Standard colors for Labs are yellow, black and chocolate. Labs are moderate to heavy shedders. Regular brushing helps remove loose hair and keeps the coat shiny. Labradors are generally healthy, but they\u2019re prone to weight gain. Many Labs will overeat if given the opportunity, so watch their food intake closely. A complete and balanced diet and daily exercise can help prevent weight gain. Other health conditions that may affect Labs include hip and elbow dysplasia, myopathy and heart disorders. Labs may also have a higher risk for certain eye conditions like progressive retinal atrophy. As with other large breed dogs, Labrador Retrievers are at risk of bloat, a life-threatening condition. Because of the breed\u2019s popularity, there\u2019s a higher risk of irresponsible breeding to fulfill demand, so make sure you work with a reputable breeder who conducts thorough health screens. As a large breed, Labrador Retrievers may benefit from a large-breed adult or puppy formula. To support a Lab\u2019s high energy levels, a high-protein dog food may also be appropriate. Labrador Retriever puppies will thrive on a puppy food specially formulated to meet their unique needs during their first year of life. For information on how much or when to feed your Labrador dog or puppy, explore our feeding articles here. The Labrador Retriever gets his name from Labrador, Canada, though the breed was developed in 19th-century Newfoundland as a water dog. Originally called St. John\u2019s dog after Newfoundland\u2019s capital, Labs worked alongside local fisherman to retrieve their catches. Early Labs may have been bred with Newfoundlands and other water dogs before a breed standard was formed. Around 1830, Labs were imported to England, where they served as hunting retrievers. The breed disappeared from Newfoundland entirely after government restrictions and various tax laws took effect. The Kennel Club in England recognized the Labrador Retriever as an official breed in 1903, however, and the American Kennel Club (AKC) followed suit in 1917. The breed\u2019s popularity soared after World War II and by 1991, Labs were the most popular dog in the U.S. They\u2019ve held onto that top spot ever since.",

They enjoy daily walks and do best with positive training. The Lhasa Apso is a Non-Sporting breed distinguished by a fabulous, floor-length coat that is worn parted down the middle, draping the body on both sides. His tail, with its plume of long, luxurious hair, curls over his back. 12 to 15 years The Lhasa Apso\u2019s coat can be one of several solid colors, such as white, cream, grizzle, red or tan. It can also be a black and tan combination. Lhasa Apsos are infrequent shedders, but their long hair does require more involved care. Owners can keep their dog\u2019s hair long, or choose a puppy cut.\u00a0\nLhasas with a puppy cut need to be brushed two-to-three times a week and bathed between visits to the groomer. Lhasas with long hair should be on the same brushing schedule and bathed every two weeks. The Lhasa Apso is generally hardy and healthy. The breed\u2019s most serious health problem is hereditary kidney dysfunction; however, thanks to responsible breeding the chances of a knowledgeable breeder placing an afflicted puppy in a home are very slim. Lhasa Apsos may find the specialized nutrition and smaller kibble of a small breed dog food beneficial. For Lhasa Apsos who need help with weight management, consider a healthy weight formula.\u00a0\nLhasa Apso puppies should eat a small breed puppy food for their first year of life to aid in their growth and development.

Brush the teeth regularly to help keep them healthy. Other health concerns may include patellar luxation and heart problems.

They enjoy swimming, hiking, long walks and other exercises they can do with their favorite people. Due to the breed\u2019s size, early and consistent training and socialization are crucial to create a well-mannered Newfie. The Newf is a strong, heavy-boned, multipurpose working dog.

His thick, plush coat protects him from the frigid waters of colder climes. 9 to 10 years Standard Newfoundland colors include gray, brown, black and white, and white.

When they weren\u2019t rescuing fishermen who had gone overboard, Newfs drew in heavy fishing nets and then carted the load to market. The breed was eventually exported to England where it soared in popularity. As a result, most Newfoundland dogs, even purebreds living in Newfoundland, are of English descent.

This friendly breed can be happy in any climate, in any home where he is loved.\u00a0\nThe Papillon may appear delicate, but these little dogs are actually quite hardy and athletic, and love to play. A member of the Toy group, the tiny Papillon makes a big impression\u2014in part because of his large, wing-like ears. In fact, these ears give the breed its name: \u201cpapillon\u201d is the French word for \u201cbutterfly.\u201d\u00a0\nSome Papillons have erect ears, while the Phalene type of this breed have ears that are down. All Paps have a plumed tail and a long, silky coat. 14\u00a0to 16\u00a0years Papillons have white coats with markings in black, lemon, red, sable, or black and tan. The Papillon\u2019s silky, long hair requires less care than you might think. This breed sheds occasionally, but does not have an undercoat, so monthly (or so) grooming, and a bath every few months, is all that he needs.\u00a0\nBetween grooming appointments, running a comb or soft brush through the long hair around his legs and behind his ears will help keep mats from forming. The Papillon is a healthy breed overall. Responsible breeders will screen for fontanels (like a human baby\u2019s soft spot) in the skull, and patellar luxation (kneecaps that can dislocate).\u00a0\nWhile this breed is certainly hardy, it is still very small. So, owners need to be careful about Papillons interacting with active children, or larger animals who might play too roughly. As a toy breed, Papillons may find the specialized nutrition and smaller kibble of a small breed dog food beneficial. For Paps who need help with weight management, consider a healthy weight formula.\u00a0\nPapillon puppies should eat small breed puppy food for their first year of life to aid in their growth and development. Papillons have a history of living in the lap of luxury, and no wonder. They were originally developed as delightful little lap dogs for noblewomen.\u00a0\nThe Papillon made its debut during the Renaissance, when miniaturized versions of larger breeds were all the rage. A cross between existing toy breeds and spaniels, the tiny Papillon breed also embodies the bloodline of a ready and athletic sporting dog.\u00a0\nThe Papillon breed was refined in Italy and Spain, and became popular in royal courts throughout Europe, especially France. It is said that Marie Antoinette\u2019s faithful Pap, Thisbe, waited for his queen outside the prison where she was held prior to her beheading.\u00a0\nThe first Papillon was registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1915, but the breed was not fully represented by its own breed club until 1935.",

The active Poodle can thrive in many living situations as long as he receives daily exercise.\nLike any intelligent, athletic dog, Poodles like to keep busy. Water retrievers by nature, they love an energetic game of fetch, and most enjoy a swim. But they are just as happy at the end of a leash, sharing a brisk jog or walk. Miniature and Standard Poodles are Non-Sporting breeds, whereas Toy Poodles naturally fall into the Toy group.\u00a0\nThey are athletes who carry themselves proudly.

According to the American Kennel Club (AKC), those colors include apricot, black, blue, brown, cream, gray, red, silver, silver beige and white. The Poodle has a low-shedding coat. The hair does grow, however, and needs regular trims and daily brushing.\u00a0\nIf a full-coated Poodle is not brushed to the skin daily, his hair will mat near the roots and will have to be shaved off. Most owners choose to keep their Poodles\u2019 coats trimmed short, which requires grooming every four to six weeks. Thanks to responsible breeding, most Poodles enjoy long, happy lives with their families. Health issues associated with the breed can include hip dysplasia and several eye disorders, as well as idiopathic epilepsy, sebaceous adenitis, von Willebrand\u2019s disease and immune-mediated disorders. \"\nToy and Miniature Poodles are more likely than Standard Poodles to experience two orthopedic problems, Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease and luxating patellas.

Pugs are a family favorite due to their even tempers, playful personalities and outgoing, loving disposition. Pugs are also known for their charming and mischievous behavior.

This means they need to live in the house with their people.\u00a0\nAlthough this breed can be strong-willed and independent, Rhodesian Ridgebacks are devoted to their families, tolerant of children and wonderfully affectionate with those they trust.\u00a0\nThey are strong, athletic, adaptable dogs who need exercise such as long walks, running or play sessions. Because of their strong prey drive, Rhodesian Ridgebacks should always be in a fully-fenced area when off leash. The Rhodesian Ridgeback is distinguished by a ridge that runs down his back where the hair grows opposite the coat. This shorthaired dog has a dignified, expressive face.\n\u00a0\nThese large, powerful dogs are classified by the American Kennel Club (AKC) as members of the Hound group. Mature Ridgebacks are naturally athletic and possess great endurance. 10\u00a0years There is only one color for the Rhodesian Ridgeback breed, which is wheaten. However, this color comprises every shade that can be seen in a wheat field, from pale flaxen to burnished red. The nose of a Ridgeback will be either black or, less commonly, brown. The Rhodesian Ridgeback is a seasonally shedding breed, but his short coat is easy to maintain. Weekly brushing and an occasional bath will keep his coat clean and glossy. Rhodesian Ridgebacks are generally healthy dogs. Responsible breeders check for hip and elbow dysplasia, thyroid function and eye anomalies. Rhodesian Ridgebacks may benefit from the nutrition offered by an adult dog food or a food for active dogs. They are known counter surfers, so be sure to keep \u201cpeople food\u201d securely stored. For Ridgebacks who need help with weight management, consider a healthy weight formula.\u00a0\nRhodesian Ridgeback puppies should eat puppy food for their first year of life to aid in their growth and development. The Rhodesian Ridgeback hails from South Africa, where crossing the native ridged Khoikhoi dog with native breeds brought by Dutch Colonists, such as Greyhounds, produced a ridged dog with superior abilities at tracking and confronting lions, and fending off other dangerous predators. Just like today, the breed was known then for its loyalty, tolerance and fondness for children.\u00a0\nAs big-game hunting in South Africa began to wane, the Rhodesian Ridgeback also started to decline. In 1922, enthusiasts created the first Ridgeback standard. The Dalmatian standard was used as a template to arrive at the breed standard recognized today.",

He thrives on farms but adapts to many living situations if provided adequate exercise.\u00a0\nShelties are intelligent, eager and easy to train, which is why they excel in obedience, agility and herding trials. They are terrific watchdogs who won\u2019t hesitate to bark. The small, active and agile Shetland Sheepdog is a member of the Herding group. With his diminutive size, wedge-shaped head, erect ears and long, straight coat, the Sheltie looks like a miniature version of a rough-coated Collie. 12 to 14\u00a0years The Shetland Sheepdog coat is a combination of white and one or two other colors, such as black, tan, blue merle, sable and sable merle. The Shetland Sheepdog\u2019s double coat sheds considerably. With an outer coat of long, straight hair and a dense, short undercoat it must be brushed weekly, and more often during shedding season.\u00a0\nOwners also need to check for mats that can form behind the ears, under the elbows and on the hindquarters. Shelties need a bath only occasionally and shouldn\u2019t be shaved. Thanks to responsible breeding, Shetland Sheepdogs are generally healthy. Breeders should screen for conditions such as hip dysplasia, thyroid disease, eye diseases, dermatomyositis, von Willebrand\u2019s disease, gallbladder mucoceles and epilepsy. Shetland Sheepdogs may benefit from the specialized nutrition and smaller kibble of a small breed dog food. For Shelties who need help with weight management, consider a healthy weight formula.\u00a0\nShetland Sheepdog puppies should eat a small breed puppy food for their first year of life to aid in their growth and development. Shetland Sheepdogs hail from the rugged Shetland Islands, where farmers used them to herd sheep, poultry and other livestock.\u00a0\nLike Shetland ponies, the Sheltie\u2019s diminutive size makes him easier to feed than his Rough Collie cousin, or other larger herding dogs\u2014an advantage in a harsh environment where food is scarcer.\u00a0\nBecause there are no records from Shetland Island breeders, we don\u2019t know exactly when Shelties were bred down to their smaller size. In fact, due to the remoteness of the Shetland Islands, this breed was virtually unknown to the rest of Britain until the early 1900s.\u00a0\nIn 1909 the Kennel Club in England first recognized the breed as the Shetland Collie.

Beneath their gentle-mannered, sensitive demeanor beats the heart of a fearless protector, devoted and ready to fill the role of watchdog.\u00a0\nThese athletic, talented dogs excel at many activities and sports. In fact, they need both physical and mental exercise daily.\u00a0\nOwners should be prepared to invest at least 30 minutes in active exercise, plus training. Vizslas are trotters who move with grace and stamina, which makes them terrific companions for runners or joggers. However, young dogs shouldn\u2019t run long distances until they mature at 18 to 24 months. Vizslas are a sporting breed with a short, easy-care coat and a slender, athletic build. Their intelligent faces are accentuated by soulful eyes. 12 to 14\u00a0years According to the American Kennel Club (AKC), the color of the Vizsla is golden rust, in varying shades. The color of the eyes, eye-rims, lips, nose, toenails and pads of the feet should blend with the color of the coat. Vizslas do shed seasonally, but their short, sleek coat has no undercoat. They need only occasional brushing, and a bath in lukewarm water when they get especially dirty. Overall the Vizsla is a healthy breed, although responsible breeders do check for conditions such as seasonal allergies, eye disorders, hip dysplasia, epilepsy and ear infections. Vizslas may benefit from an adult dog food for active dogs. Although this breed tends to stay active, if you are concerned about a Vizsla\u2019s weight, consider a healthy weight formula.\u00a0\nVizsla puppies should eat puppy food for their first year of life to aid in their growth and development. The ancestors of the modern Vizsla were bred by the Magyar people, who left the Russian steppes in the mid-800s and rampaged the Western Europe for the next 50 years, before settling in what we now know as Hungary.\u00a0\nThe Magyar warriors travelled on horseback, and their horses where known for their speed and agility. They also bred these qualities into their nimble, red-coated dogs.\u00a0\nThroughout the following centuries, breeding by Hungarian nobles and warlords created a hunting dog breed known for its swiftness and ability to rise to almost any challenge. This eager willingness and \u201ccan do\u201d attitude made the Vizsla a favorite with many American enthusiasts.\u00a0\nThe first Vizsla to arrive in America was smuggled out of Communist Hungary, aided by a U.S. State Department employee, in 1950. Fifty years later, a Vizsla named Chartay became the first dog in AKC history to earn championships in five different sports.",

These small but bold dogs flushed foxes from their lairs, allowing the hounds and horsemen to give chase.\u00a0\nTo avoid being mistaken for foxes, Fox Terriers were bred with mostly white coats, with no red coloring allowed.\u00a0\nWire Fox Terriers have always been popular in England. One historical example is Caesar, King Edward VII\u2019s favorite dog, who was the darling of the entire British Empire.\u00a0\nIn the 1930s and 40s, a Wire named Asta starred in six \u201cThin Man\u201d movies, putting the breed in the spotlight and increasing its popularity. The Wire\u2019s entertaining talent and enchanting, expressive nature have made it a popular performer in movies and on TV.\u00a0\nSince the late 1800s, Wire and Smooth Fox Terriers have been recognized as separate breeds in England. The American Kennel Club (AKC) did not recognize the two breeds separately until 1985.",

                    "Smooth and Wire Fox Terriers were considered the same breed for many years, with interbreeding ceasing in the early 1900s. ",
                    " Wire Fox Terriers have won Best In Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show 15 times, more than any other dog breed.\u00a0 ",
                    " Naturalist Charles Darwin owned many dogs throughout his life, including a Wire Fox Terrier named Polly. Polly was a model for illustrations in his last book Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals. ",

                "temperament": "Like other toy dog breeds, the Yorkshire Terrier has a big personality. Yorkies are fearless, tenacious and fiercely protective, which makes them perfect little watch dogs. This toy-sized dog is intelligent and eager to please, but can be stubborn at times. Training and socializing a Yorkshire Terrier puppy should begin at an early age. Although small in size, Yorkies still need some exercise. A couple short walks a day and occasional games of fetch will help keep them physically and mentally fit. Yorkies have a long, floor-length coat covering their small, compact bodies. The hair around their eyes is either trimmed short or pulled into a \u201ctopknot,\u201d often accented with a bow. The long hair is parted down the middle from the back of the head to the tail. It hangs straight down either side of the body. 11 to 15 years The most common colors are a combination of blue and tan or blue and gold. Other colors may include black and gold or black and tan. The Yorkie\u2019s hypoallergenic coat sheds infrequently, but requires daily brushing and weekly baths to keep the hair clean and tangle free. Yorkshire Terriers are a healthy breed overall. A couple health conditions to watch for include eye problems and a dislocated kneecap known as luxating patella. Limit a Yorkie\u2019s jumping height to help prevent luxating patella. Yorkies may be prone to weight gain, so they need daily exercise and monitored food and treat intake. Yorkshire Terriers need a complete and balanced dog food or puppy food. Because they have smaller mouths, they may prefer a small breed dog food with smaller kibble pieces. For information on how much or when to feed your Yorkie dog or puppy, explore our feeding articles here. When Scotland weavers migrated to Yorkshire and Lancashire in northern England, they brought their terriers with them. Over time, they bred a new terrier from several types of now-extinct Scottish terriers, plus the Skye Terrier, Dandie Dinmont Terrier and perhaps even the Maltese. Yorkies were bred to squeeze into small spaces to root out rodents in the mid-1800s. After the Kennel Club of England recognized the breed in 1886, the Yorkshire Terrier went from a working dog to fashionable ladies\u2019 companion. The breed\u2019s size decreased further as a result of its newfound popularity as a ladies\u2019 lap dog. The Yorkshire Terrier was first noted in the U.S. in the 1870s.
