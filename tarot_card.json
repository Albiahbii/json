Instead of trying to force or pressure a relationship to come into fruition, use this time to see how your perspective changes when you\u2019re alone. This same thing applies within relationships as well. Timing may be an issue when it comes to having important discussions, or taking your relationship to the next level.\n\nAlternatively, the concept of sacrifice may play an important role in your relationships, or potential relationships now.

At times, you need to just wait, and the things that you were pushing for so hard, whether it\u2019s a response from a business partner or colleague, or a decision from a client, or a decision on what to change in your career, will come in time. Relax, and just be. Alternatively, you may be in the process of making a big change in your career.

With this new perspective, you are now equipped to take action or make changes in your romantic life with renewed energy. This card also can caution against making needless sacrifices for love.

The Death card signalsthat one major phase in your life is ending, and a new one is going to start. Another meaning is that you are going to go through a major change, transition, or transformation. The old version of you needs to \u2018die\u2019 to allow the new you to be created. This can be a scary time for you because you may be unsure of what will happen in the future. Even if you are scared, you should welcome the change because you are opening the door to new life events. Death can also mean that you need to let go of any unhealthy attachments that you have in your life. This is an important part of life, so learning to keep moving forward is one of the lessons Death teaches us. When it comes to love and relationships, the Death tarot card love meaning can indicate being stuck in emotional dynamics that are no longer working. If you are already in a relationship, for the relationship to continue, you must learn to embrace change. Sometimes, this card can also indicate that you may want to end the relationship, especially if it hasn't been going well. It is important to remember that all doors that close with the Death tarot card open another. While Death may be difficult to accept in a love tarot reading, transformations for one partner or another may be what is needed to help both individuals grow.

You could be worried about letting go of the past, or you could not be sure of the changes that you need to make to go forward. Resisting the change and holding onto the past can limit your future, which can cause you to feel like you are in limbo. You should take some time to assess the ways that you have been approaching changes in your life. You may find you have been halting the changes that you need due to fears of the unknown. While you can still be afraid, you should trust that you are taking the right steps and move forward. Life moves on, so fighting passing time is only going to leave you with regrets. Death does not have to be a card of regret, especially if you heed its warning.

Change is inevitable; this applies to our career as well as other aspects of our lives. We must learn to welcome it instead of pushing it away. When we cling to a cycle that is no longer meant to remain in our lives, we watch it slowly decay and drain us.

If it is the latter, try to rein in your spending. Be aware of every economic decision and ask yourself if this will serve you well in the end.",

If there was a recent conflict or competition at work, it likely did not or will not resolve itself in your favor. If there have not been such specific moments of tension, the six might be in reference to your general feelings at work. These feelings will manifest as a sense of stagnation or disinterest in projects. It could be that owing to a lack of drive, you feel stuck in your current position. Regardless of the exact context, this is a sign of underachievement. If the six of wands appears to you in this position, take a moment to reassess your finances. There has likely been a downturn in your financial situation. This can be due to a single negative event or represent the state of your economic affairs more broadly. If it is the former, an investment that you made may not have yielded results, or a purchase you made wasn\u2019t what you thought it would be. If there have not been individual investments or purchases that have decreased your financial holdings, it is likely that your money is dwindling more slowly.

Just like in your love aspect, we advise you to be patient. Save your money and wait for the perfect time to invest. All things that you fought for are building in momentum.

Either you are not moving fast enough in your job or you have moved too quickly in the past. Take stock of how you feel. If you are frustrated by a sense of stagnation at work, this card can signal that you have missed opportunities by failing to act in time. You are not advancing because you let the opportunity to do so pass. If, however, you recently moved up in your career, it might be that you moved too quickly. This concern will manifest by feeling overwhelmed by what people are asking of you. If projects seem daunting, it might be useful to talk to someone about how they handle such tasks. You will learn to handle your new responsibilities, but it will take time and patience. The eight of wand here means that you are likely frustrated with the speed at which money is coming in. You might feel as if there is not enough or you should be having money flow in faster. The main take away from a card is that you should be more patient and remember that everything you are doing is part of your slow march towards progress. Your small investments today will pay off in the end (even if they are frustrating now). If your job does not pay as well as you would like, it might be that you are still paying your dues.

People can oftentimes become envious of success, so it is not enough to rest on your laurels. Sometimes, such as now, you may need to be on guard for people attempting to undermine you.

Her aptitude for language also makes her an incredible communicator, and with her love of ideas, you may find her always engaged in some passionate debate. She seems to thrive on almost a kind of nervous energy, as if there was too much inside her to say, the wheels in her head always turning. As a news bearer, she may bring news that is represented by her suit - particularly, gossip, legal matters, agreements. Alternatively, you may find yourself required to use her energy - be alert, keep your eyes open and stay sharp and vigilant. This card may indicatethat you are very eager to execute an idea that you have been having or a project that you cooked up just recently. You are quite passionate about it, and you cannot wait to share the progress with others. Compared to your passionate heart, time seems to be standing still. It is time to be talkative.

In relationships however, they may be scared of emotional confrontations, and can likely be completely avoidant if they are faced with them. As an emotional state or a quality, the Page of Swords tarot love meaning can signal a relationship that is more cerebral, where lovers are more likely to love heady discussions, but are perhaps a bit more wary of emotional intimacy. One partner can also feel that their emotional needs are not being met. Sometimes, it can also signal small or petty disputes with your partner, which can turn into bigger conflicts should they not be handled properly.",

Since this card is a page, this does point to some sort of apprenticeship, or new experience, meaning that you may either be in a period of training, school or the start of a new job or career path. With your ambition, you have lots of goals, and you\u2019ll likely have some extra education, or experience so that you can reach those goals.",

You may also be very curious about finances at this time; it\u2019s a complex world, and the more you understand about it, the better you can maximize your earnings. Take some time to study retirement fund options, stocks, bonds and other financial products, or find a financial planner that can help guide you.",

Being gifted with a sharp and alert mind, she may be using it for deception and manipulation. The sword that she wields may be used to create pain, her natural gift for language turned to a weapon. She may lack the understanding or the maturity to understand the suffering that she causes, feeling the rush that one gets upon lashing out. On the other hand, this page may be someone of empty words or promises - who though loves talking, does not really talk about much ofsubstance.

This card can also suggest a failure in communication between partners, or perhaps even a misunderstanding creating paranoia. For your relationship to flourish, partners will have to learn some degree of tolerance for different viewpoints, flexibility and find a desire to cooperate, rather than create conflict. You have lots of energy and curiosity, but right now it\u2019s not really directed at anything. With no outlet, it seems like you can\u2019t quite make up your mind about what it is you actually want to do for your future. You may move from one job to the next when you get bored, or decide it\u2019s not for you. Oftentimes, to really get the full depth and experience of working somewhere, you do need to commit for a long time. Sometimes, this card can also indicate having lots of big ideas, but zero follow through. Without action, nothing ever comes to fruition. Get working!

The tale of the suit of swords is a powerful metaphor, one that ends in tragedy. The swords are a symbol of the intellect, of intelligence and logic, and yet we find the final culmination of this suit a complete and total defeat of the spirit. We must realize that the swords are a weapon that can have immense potential for destruction or for good. The story as it unfolds from the ace to the ten is one where an untrained individual uses this weapon for faulty reasons - makes many mistakes, and then spends an entire lifetime attempting to run away from the power that he misused. The story as it unfolds from the ace to the ten is one where an untrained individual uses this weapon for faulty reasons - makes many mistakes, and then spends an entire lifetime attempting to run away from the power that he misused. This person believes the swords are external to him when they are part of him, and when they inevitably return, he once again suffers. His pain is not the pain of his circumstances usually, but the pain of fear, of anxiety, of not being able to be a master of his surroundings. After the hopelessness of the nine of swords, what could have happened? Were you overwhelmed by the pressure? Or did you take the final sword upon yourself and admit defeat?",
