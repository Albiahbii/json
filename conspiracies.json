    "title": "A Flying Saucer Crashed at Roswell in 1947",
    "content": "In 1947 an object crashed to the ground near a ranch in New Mexico. The object was officially stated to be a United States Air Force Balloon by the United States Military. This was generally accepted until the 1970s when a variety of Extra Terrestrial related theories began surfacing. The Rancher who saw the crash, William Brazel, is reported as saying that indestructible metal no wider than tinfoil was found with strange markings etched upon its surface. The writings/etchings were in different colors with different geometric patterns. Brazel came under severe pressure from government officials. A column written by the current local newspaper at the time ran with the headline \u201cHarassed Rancher Sorry he ever told about it\u201d. It was not only Brazel who noticed the disk. A number of people have claimed to have seen debris from the flying object strewn over a wider area.\nAn issue with old conspiracy theories such as this is there is little in the way of verifiable information. There is also a shortage of data itself, given that the internet was not available at the time. The Roswell Incident of 1947 is largely accredited with being the first publicized encounter between the American people and UFOs.\nProject Mogul\nAs the theory goes, Project Mogul was a military espionage project which used high altitude balloons in order to listen for sound waves from Soviet testing on Atomic bombs. Brazel had previously found such wreckage on his ranch, which is why he was so sure that the Roswell disk was not a Weather Balloon. Brazel stated that what he saw was definitely not a weather Balloon.\n\u201cI am sure that what I saw was not any weather observation balloon.\u201d \nRoswell 1947 Conspiracy Theories\n\nThe obvious theory that emerged from the Roswell incident was that the flying saucer was an Alien spaceship. There are many branches which spring from this theory. One theory is that the flying saucer was an Atomic Bomb. This theory was proposed by well known UFO theorist Jun Keith. The underlying rationale for the cover-up was that the government did not want the Soviets to know that they no longer had a supply of atomic weapons, and also that the accidental dropping of an atomic bomb would have led to a negative public reaction. It has also been proposed that the UFO was a plane manned by Chimps. There is no evidence of chimps in relation to the Roswell incident. Another theory surrounding the incident was that the disk/balloon was, in fact, a time machine. Philip J. Corso and William J. Birnes wrote a book titled the day after Roswell which documented that Corso helped the US government to sell the advanced technological machinery to Corporations. It is claimed in the book that these technologies later led to fiber optics and microprocessors. Corso believed that the \u201caliens\u201d on board the spacecraft were humans from the future who were genetically engineered to withstand spaceflight and that the Earth was at war with the Extra Terrestrials until Regan defeated them in the 1980\u2019s.\nBuy this book on Amazon\nUfologist Nick Redfern proposed that the Roswell incident was a result of a crash between an experimental test flown aircraft. The first contained deformed Japanese prisoners of war which had been suffering from progeria and radiation poisoning. The second plane was struck by lightning and was an aircraft affixed to a Balloon, based on a Japanese design. The Japanese prisoners of war were allegedly taken from area 731, an area where the Japanese performed biological experiments on subjects. What US forces were doing with these topics is never explained by Redfern.\nInsincere UFO claims\nRoswell, Aliens\nIn 1995 a businessman (Ray Santilli) from London released footage of an Alien autopsy performed in Roswell in 1947. This was quickly ridiculed and pulled apart, and the producer of the film later admitted that it was a fake, but insisted that real footage was out there. Glenn Dennis claimed to have walked into an examination room in 1989, where he saw three doctors huddled over a number of small, bald, childlike Aliens. One of more far out theories that emanated from the Roswell incident came from Redfern. According to Redfern, the wreckage was created by satanic demons in order to trick humanity into thinking that Extra Terrestrials had landed when in fact it was the arrival of the demons. Redfern also believes that all UFO abductions are cover ups for demons who are wreaking havoc on our souls. He also claimed that the aliens in the Santilli footage were suffering from Progeria, the same video that Santilli later stated was fake a year later.\nRoswell Daily Record Newspaper on UFO Crash Site\nThere are numerous individuals who claim to have seen alien bodies being tested or transported by the Military. These include Glenn Dennis, Jim Ragsdale, Miriam Bush, Gerald Anderson and Barney Barnett. Alien bodies are typically described as being small with no hair and large heads.\nIt is well documented in relation to UFO sightings that:\n\nThe sightings increase significantly in the years of blockbuster Sci-Fi releases such as Mars Attacks, Star Wars and Independence Day\nThe majority of sightings are reported on nights when people are drunk\n\nWhile the vast majority of conspiracy claims are false, one piece of information arousing suspicion is that the initial press release from the Roswell Army Air Field indicated that the wreckage of a crashed disk had been recovered. A second Press Release issued the next day by the military stated that the crashed disk was, in fact, a weather Balloon which was mistakenly identified as a disk.\nConclusion\nDid a flying Saucer Crash in Roswell in 1947? Possibly. All the theories which emerged from the Roswell incident are far flung with little evidence. As with 99% of these arguments, there are unexplained actions on behalf of the authorities, and there is quite probably more to the official story than meets the eye. However, there is no evidence to back up any of the emerging theories, from flying chimpanzees to time machines.\nDocumentaries and Related Videos\n1.

    "title": "Adolf Hitler Fakes Death",
    "content": "Adolf Hitler is probably one of the most infamous people of all time, the Fuehrer of Nazi Germany and chief orchestrator of the Holocaust, in which over 6 million Jews are reported to have died. He was the instigator of World War II and leader of the Nazi party. He gained popularity in Germany after promoting Antisemitism, Pan-Germanism and Anti-Communism. Adolf Hitler believed Germans to be superior to other races, who were viewed as inferior. He also denounced Capitalism, as well as Communism, as being parts of a Jewish Conspiracy.\nTowards the end of World War II, the interference of Hitler into the strategic offensive in Russia cost the Axis power dearly. His refusal to allow forces to withdraw from the battle of Stalingrad led to the death of 200,000 Axis soldiers with over 235,000 taken prisoner. His military judgment only became more and more erratic as time went on. Between 1939 and 1945 there were multiple attacks on the life of Hitler, the most famous being the attempt by Claus von Stauffenberg who planted a bomb in Hitler\u2019s headquarters. Hitler narrowly survived as one of his aides removed his briefcase behind the leg of a heavy conference table, where the bomb was stored. This led to sharp reprisals from Hitler, with over 4900 executions.\nClaus von Stauffenberg\nBy the end of 1944, the Reds and the Allies were advancing through Germany. After the Ardennes offensive had failed Hitler ordered the destruction of all military devices and industrial infrastructure before it could fall into the hands of the Allies. This command was disobeyed at last by Albert Speer, the Minister for Armaments. Hitler knew his time had come and on April 20th, 1956 made his final trip to the surface from his underground bunker. With the Soviets encircling Berlin Hitler commanded Waffen SS General Felix Steiner to launch the offensive. Upon finding out that Steiner disobeyed he ordered everyone except Wilhelm Keitel, Alfred Jodl, Hans Krebs, and Wilhelm Burgdorf to leave the room, and went on a now-famous tirade against the treachery of his commanders. He ended his speech stating that he would stay in Berlin until the end and shoot himself, having finally given up hope.\nAdolf Hitler and Eva Braun\nOn April 29th he married Eva Braun and indicated his will to his secretary. The events were witnessed and documents signed in the presence of Krebs, Burgdorf, Goebbels, and Bormann. On the 30th April 1945, Hitler shot himself and Eva Braun bit into a cyanide capsule. Hitler\u2019s body was burned and all that could be used to identify the Fuehrer was his lower jaw. It should be noted that most theories to the contrary that the Fuehrer and Eva escaped the city are regarded as fringe theories by the vast majority of historians. Heinz Linge, Hitler\u2019s valet, heard a gunshot and found the Fuehrer dead next to his newly married wife who had apparently taken Cyanide, and Hitler had shot himself. However there is some debate as to how he died and who found him. Not only are the German accounts not trusted, neither are the accounts of the Soviets who were the first on the scene. They were not allies of the West as such. It was more than they had a common enemy. There was a race to Hitler\u2019s bunker which was won by the Soviets.\nHitler Conspiracies\nMain Conspiracy: Adolf Hitler fakes death\nA theory that surrounds the death of every famous figure. There are a number of offshoots to this theory. It is often contended that declassified FBI documents contain a number of alleged sightings of Hitler. However, the FBI states within these documents that the claims cannot be substantiated.\n\nIt has been contended that the bodies that were shot and found were doubles, though there is no evidence that such is the case, merely claims. However, it is well known that Hitler did in fact have a double, Gustav Weler. It is also pointed out that in 2009 a skull fragment with a bullet hole was not actually the skull of Hitler but that of a young woman. However this point is moot as while this skull was widely believed to be the skull of Hitler, no Soviet or Russian Officials ever claimed that it was. The dental remains were what actually confirmed the fragments to be the remains of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun.\nHitler in Argentina\nGrey Wolf: The Escape of Adolf Hitler 2011 \u2013 Check on Amazon\nThe book titled Grey Wolf: The Escape of Adolf Hitler 2011 is the most popular piece of literature documenting the escape of Hitler from Berlin to Argentina. The book was written by British authors Simon Dunstan and Gerrard Williams. The book is founded on the idea that Hitler was hugely rich from royalties from his book Mein Kampf, which was mandatory reading for all those within the Third Reich and that the Nazis had stolen art and gold from occupied countries. This wealth was funneled by the Fuehrer to Argentina where he made his escape. The book contends that he died in 1962 after living in a Bavarian-style mansion in Inalco, just off the Chilean border. The contention of the authors is that there is no video or photography of the death and that those who testified had an interest in keeping the escape of Adolf Hitler a secret. The main contentions are:\n\nHitler had the means to escape the city and huge resources, being the richest man in Europe.\nConfirmed records of U-Boat landings off the coast of Patagonia.\nWritten testimonies of Argentinian people who saw him or worked for him (attendant, cook, nurse etc).\nFBI documents which confess that Hitler might be alive in Argentina.\n\nThis book is widely ridiculed by most historians and has no substantiation. Again to keep such a deception quiet would require the consent of so many people over such a long time period to be regarded as entirely implausible. Historian Guy Walters was very outspoken about the book describing it as \u201crubbish\u201d, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s no substance to it at all. It appeals to the deluded fantasies of conspiracy theorists\u201d.\nIn 2014 a controversial documentary was produced by Gerrard Williams called Grey Wolf. It features a number of people who claim to have seen Hitler in Argentina.\nBoth the book and the film Grey Wolf have been backed up by a retired CIA official who has claimed that Adolf Hitler faked his own death. The claim is that Hitler made his way to Argentina initially by Luftwaffe plane and then by a submarine which collected him at the Canary Islands and carried him to the coast of Patagonia. Bob Baer and his team claim to have access to over 700 pages of classified documentation that have recently been declassified. One document states that British Intelligence were aware that Hitler was flown from Berlin via a Luftwaffe plane. Baer and his team believe that the corpse found was a double and that it was found to be 5 inches shorter than Hitler. The body was initially discovered by the Russians. It is also claimed that there was a fifth exit from the bunker which was not found, though it is hard to believe that an exit would simply be not found in a case as important as this. It is also contended by many theorists of this line of thought that many Nazis were not sentenced and all made a mass exodus to South America where they continued their plans and have since infiltrated Corporate America and in particular the pharmaceutical Industry. It is true that tens of thousand of Nazis escaped and were not sentenced, including Adolf Eichmann and Josef Mengele.\nFakes Death \u2013 Hitler in Brazil\nIn another version of this theory Hitler lived well into his 90\u2019s and went to Paraguay and then Brazil. He came to be known as \u201cThe Old German\u201d in the town of Nossa Senhora do Livramento after adopting the name Adolf Leipzig (Why he would keep his first name is not explained in this theory). Brazilian Jew Simoni Renee Guerreiro Dias wrote the book Hitler in Brazil \u2013 His Life and Death, claiming that Hitler went to Brazil looking for buried treasure given to him by associates in the Vatican. She contends that Leipzig\u2019s remains be exhumed and his DNA tested against the living relatives of Hitler. She further claims that he chose the name Leipzig as it was the birthplace of Hitler\u2019s favorite composer. Johann Sebastian Bach. She photoshopped a picture of Adolf Leipzig with a mustache and used it as evidence that it was Adolf Hitler. Historians and academics have also dismissed the idea that Hitler came to Brazil after his alleged escape from Berlin. There is simply no substance whatsoever to the theory that Hitler fled to Brazil. Contrary to the official story which indicates Heinz Linge as the man to find Hitler, this book indicates that it was his bodyguard Rochus Misch, who said he heard a gunshot and came in to see the F\u00fchrer slumped dead over the table. He died in 2016. This picture is cited as evidence that Hitler fled to Brazil where he changed his name to Adolf Leipzig.\nConvincing Evidence about Hitler\u2019s death\nHitler most likely died in the bunker in 1945. However, it is impossible to know for sure. There are a few key points to consider:\n\nThe Soviets were the first to arrive on the scene. Thus the information went from those closest to Hitler ( four Nazis who were utterly devoted to Hitler), to the Soviets, who passed on information to the Allies, who issued headlines to the public. It would be naive to believe that the information was not altered by one of these parties before reaching public eyes and ears.\nAt the time of Hitler\u2019s death, media outlets all over the world were printing headlines asking whether or not Hitler really died, including the New York Times.\nThere was a report in a Swedish newspaper on April 26th indicating that a double had been put in Hitler\u2019s place in order to \u201cdie on the barricades\u201d. The paper, citing the free German Press Service, said that the man had been trained to talk and act like Hitler in every possible way. Hitler was known to have had at least 6 doubles.\nWhen Stalin was asked by President Truman whether or not Hitler was dead, he simply replied \u201cNo\u201d. Stalin\u2019s top officer,\u00a0Georgy Konstantinovich Zhukov, reported that \u201cWe have found no corpse that could be Hitler\u2019s.\u201d\nPresident Eisenhower \u201cWe have been unable to unearth one bit of tangible evidence of Hitler\u2019s death. Many people believe that Hitler escaped from Berlin.\u201d\nNo German witnesses ever saw or identified the remains said to be Hitler\u2019s, but this could not be due to a shortage of witnesses. This is in sharp contrast to that of Nazi Joseph Goebbels, who had 20 Germans line up to identify his body(Goebbels had committed suicide with his wife and children).\nThe body of Joseph Goebbels was put on display and photographed from all angles. There was but a single photo taken of Hitler. Similarly, there were numerous photographs taken of President Kennedy and General Gaddafi. To quench any possibility of survival myths taking place such photographs have to be taken. This was not done in Adolf Hitler\u2019s case.\n\nAdolf Hitler Fringe Conspiracy Theories\nThere are also a number of theories which have emerged that are much further out than a mere escape. One such theory relates to that of black magician Aleister Crowley. Crowley claimed that Adolf Hitler was his magic child, a term used to describe the produce of an unguarded psyche. The demoralization of Germany was the goal of this dark magician \u2013\n\u201cIt was necessary to persuade the Germans that arrogance and violence were sound policy, that bad faith was the cleverest diplomacy, that insult was the true meaning of winning friendship, and direct injury the proper conjuration to call up gratitude.\u201d\nInquiries into such theories involve the occult and black magic which invariably cannot be proven. Another theory is that Adolf Hitler did not have any hatred whatsoever of Jews until after his treatment. He had earned considerable awards and honors from serving in the Bavarian army, and his speeches changed from 1919 onward. Hitler was hospitalized after being blinded by mustard gas in World War One. He miraculously regained his sight and only decided to enter politics while in the hospital. In 1918 the Louisiana Journal of Forensic Science indicated that a hypnotic suggestion given to Hitler during treatment could have been what instilled the belief that he was meant to rule the world and eradicate the Jews. It was said to be a miracle that he was able to see again. It is agreed by psychohistorians that the biggest behavioral change in Hitler took place after his treatment. He found new qualities of ceremonial speech and rhetoric and lost the talent he once had for painting. And the theory contends that the hatred Hitler had with regard to Jews was implanted there by brainwashing techniques, drugs and hypnosis.\nConclusion\nWhen all the evidence is taken together and analyzed it seems that, on the balance of probabilities, it\u2019s around 50/50. There are a number of questions surrounding Hitler\u2019s death which do not add up. However, there is no conclusive evidence of an escape. The balance of probabilities might swing just in the balance of the official story, but not by a wide margin due to the huge number of question marks. And also due to the correct identification of Hitler via dental fragments. This has not been dealt with by any theorists accurately and until it is, we will have to assume that the remains are Hitlers and his death was a suicide.\nAdolf Hitler Fake Death Conspiracy Documentaries\nBelow you can find some conspiracy documentaries with the claims about death and escape of Adolf Hitler to South America.\n1.

    "title": "AIDS",
    "content": "An epidemic that struck our nation in the 1980s was the AIDS epidemic.\u00a0While HIV/AIDS it still a deadly disease worldwide, it is currently controlled better in America than other parts of the world, mainly Africa. While much of it can now be maintained and treated, it was a disease that took the United States by storm in the 1980s as it killed many Americans in a short time period. The HIV/AIDS scare of the 1980s and 1990s reached dramatic heights when several famous actors and musicians died from this disease. The picture to the right is of famous Hollywood actor Rock Hudson, who passed away from complication of the disease in October of 1985.\nWhile AIDS occurred in a number of individuals, the most widely affected were the homosexual community and African-Americans. The United States Government has long proclaimed that the origins of AIDS were coming from primates in Africa in the 1930s. The support was that humans who interacted with these primates were passed this deadly virus. The AIDS virus could then be passed to other humans through sexual intercourse or some type of blood transfusion. While this is the common idea shared by most, there are others who have their own HIV conspiracy theories that are quite different from what most scientists have suggested and have a belief that aids is man made.\nCommon AIDS Conspiracy Theories\n1. Created to Kill Africans\nWangari Maathai, Kenyan ecologist\nWangari Maathai, a Kenyan ecologist who won the Nobel Peace Prize, was one of the most notable conspiracy theorists against the exact origins of the HIV/AIDS virus.\u00a0 Maathai along with other theorists believe that the CIA or another government entity had scientists create the virus to wipe out the African population. In an interview with Time Magazine Maathai was quoted as saying \u201cI am sure people know where it came from or where did HIV originate, but I\u2019m quite sure it did not come from monkeys\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Many \u201cAfrican AIDS theorists\u201d believe that the disease was created to wipe out the African population so that the United States could eventually take over this part of the world.\n2. Wipe Out Homosexuals\nBesides Maathai, many other AIDS conspiracy theorists argued that the disease was created to rid the United States of homosexuals. These theorists argue that AIDS was created in a laboratory and was injected into a large number of gay males in the San Francisco and New York population, where it continued to spread among the gay population. These people believed that the disco era has brought a time where homosexuality was \u201cout of control\u201d and that AIDS was created to scare and extinct this crowd. If this is true, it worked well as the AIDS scare coincided with the end of the disco era, which was widely popular among homosexuals. The \u201cAIDS man made\u201d\u00a0 theorists usually take the stance when targeted at the American population.\n3. Cure for the Rich\nMagic Johnson HIV press conference in 1991\nAnother theory that was brought up that there has always been a cure for AIDS/HIV and that only the richest and wealthiest people can receive the treatment. This came about after Earvin \u201cMagic\u201d Johnson\u00a0announced that he had contracted HIV in 1991 and retired from the NBA. As of this writing, Magic Johnson is still alive and well and he has been able to maintain HIV in a dormant state. Magic was seen much heavier than his playing days after retirement and many believe that he had the money and means for the HIV cure. Many people have speculated that Johnson may have found a magical cure in Kenya or gone through a witch doctor to rid him of the disease, but Johnson denies all these rumors. Johnson simply states that he takes a daily concoction of drugs that help keep the virus dormant in his body.\n4. Nixon and the Special Virus Cancer Program\nAnother common AIDS conspiracy is that it was created as America was launching programs to help fight cancer during Richard Nixon\u2019s presidency in the early 1970s.\u00a0 These theorists state that using a vaccine that was found in primates contained the \u201cancestor virus\u201d of HIV. These viruses were tested in laboratories in the 1970s and were given to human subjects who were then infected with the toxic virus we know of as AIDS. Because of the timing of this right before AIDS was first discovered, this is a very popular HIV conspiracy that many people believed was covered up by our government.\n5. God\u2019s Will\nJerry Falwell preached on God\u2019s Will\nOne common conspiracy that was suggested mainly by religious leaders and their followers was that HIV/AIDS was God\u2019s punishment against homosexuals. The late Jerry Falwell, a well know televangelist from the 1980s was one of the leaders of these schools of thought. Falwell used the Bible as his main argument that God does not tolerate homosexuality and that AIDS was \u201cGod\u2019s punishment\u201d to homosexuals and the societies that tolerate them. Among the AIDS conspiracy theories that have been researched, this one is the most far-fetched as it shows no medical evidence other than a \u201creligious\u201d belief system.\n6. A Druggie\u2019s Disease\nIn 1996 University of Cal Berkeley professor proclaimed that HIV is harmless and that AIDS goes hand in hand with recreational drug use. This theory was also taken as a stance by former South African President Thabo Mbeki, who later backtracked and said that most cases of AIDS were caused by poverty, poor nourishment and overall bad health. He felt that the elimination of poverty in Africa would dramatically decrease the number of AIDS deaths.\nAs one of the most deadly epidemics of the last 30 years, the HIV conspiracy has arguments for various ways that the disease started. Most often when people ask an average person \u201cWhere did HIV originate?\u201d the typical answer is from primates. These theories above are what the others think about this disease.\nDocumentaries and Related Videos\n1. The Creation Of HIV/Aids\n\n2. AIDS: Fact or Fraud\n\n3.\u00a0Truth about Aids\n\n4.

    "title": "Area 51 ",
    "content": "One of the worst kept secrets among government agencies was finally revealed by the CIA in 2013, as Area 51 in Nevada was finally acknowledged as a testing ground for the United States government. After years of strange sightings above this remote location, approximately 100 miles outside of Las Vegas, the Freedom of Information Act\u00a0let Americans know about many of the things that occurred in the place known as Area 51 since the Cold War. The famous U-2 spy plane along with many other of our most secretive planes were built and tested at Area 51. Up until recently, we were never 100% sure about what existed in Area 51, but with the magic of Google Maps, we now know there is something behind those barbed wire fences.\nIn face Area 51 Security adds to the hype as anyone coming even near the fences around this area will be apprehended by a small army of military and other government security. Obviously, with this much security in a place that is not advertised to the public means that there is probably something to hide. While much of it is government and military classified work, others suggest that there may be more. Let\u2019s look at some more of what we do know.\nLockheed Martin \u201cSkunk works\u201d is one of the lead manufacturers in Area 51 and has created many flying objects that have been mistaken for UFOs by people who live around Area 51. The SR-71, a plane that flew at the speed above Mach 3, was one of the many planes that was built and tested in Area 51 during the last 50 years. Also, many military aircrafts such as the F-117 Nighthawk, the first radar-evading aircraft which was made famous during Operation Desert Storm, were said to be tested and manufactured in the place known as Area 51. Despite all of these claims, many believe there are deeper darker secrets inside this secret location and many of this has to do with extra-terrestrial aircrafts and aliens. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the most common Area 51 conspiracy theories.\nArea 51 Conspiracies\nThe Roswell New Mexico UFO conspiracy\nSpawning a popular TV series with the same name, countless cable television series and many documentaries the alleged Roswell alien crash in July 1947 was the encounter that put Area 51 on the map as far as it goes with alien conspiracies. While we save the in depth coverage of this event for another post, we will cover a brief overview of what happened below that backs up some of the alleged Area 51 conspiracies.\nMac Brazel w/ Roswell debris\nIn July 1947 a rancher by the name of Mac Brazel\u00a0found strange metal strewn over his land in New Mexico. Brazel took this debris to the authorities in Roswell. The commanding officer at the time Colonel Blanchard was also intrigued and he ordered an investigation. After collecting the shrapnel and other evidence off of Brazel\u2019s property, the first Army command at Roswell issued a press release stating that they had recovered some type of \u201cflying disk\u201d\nAfter this the Army later retracted the statement and suggested that it was shrapnel from a weather balloon. Not until some 30 years later in the 1970s did the Roswell conspiracy theories become popular among theorists, when Jesse Marcel commented publicly about the Roswell event. There are numerous different theories tied to Roswell and Area 51, with one of the biggest is that Area 51 is used as a hiding ground of the flying objects and secret alien bodies that were discovered in this wreckage.\nOther Alien Area 51 Conspiracy Theories\nBesides the alleged events that took place in Roswell, New Mexico there have been many more claims of UFOs and extraterrestrial beings being taken to and biopsied at Area 51. Ever since the Roswell event in 1947, there have been numerous alleged conspiracies that have said to taken place at Area 51. Mysterious flying objects in the sky and alleged crash debris has been always tied to Area 51 by alleged theories. In 1996 the New York Times wrote a famed article that detailed many things alleged by UFO experts and conspiracy theory experts when it comes to Area 51. You can read more about these here.\nThe Aurora Project\nWhile many of the UFO and alien conspiracy theories may or may not be true,\u00a0 the fact that the United States government now admits that Area 51 is real is a fact. Many of our national defense planes and other aircrafts are thought to be built and tested in the large area above and around Area 51. Many of these secret aircrafts put the Area 51 conspiracies to rest, as they are aircrafts that have never been shown to the American public.\nOne of the most talked about stealth aircrafts of all-time known as the \u201cAurora Project\u201d is thought to be flown around the Area 51. This aircraft is allegedly the fastest aircraft ever created with speed up to Mach 6. Many look at the runway of Groom Lake, which is supposedly 6 miles long, as a clear indication of a place that supersonic aircrafts are tested.\nConclusion\nArea 51 is one of the most widely recognized secrets in the United States. While only a select few know for sure what happens in this facility, many believe that there are supernatural events and government tests that would change the way we feel about the universe. Will Area 51 conspiracy theories last forever or will the United States government eventually come clean about everything that happens behind the barbed wired fences?\nDocumentaries and Related Videos\nArea 51 The CIA\u2019s Secret Files\n\nBob Lazar UFO Area 51 Documentary\n\nHistory Channel \u2013 UFO Sightings Area 51",

    "content": "1. Atlantis\nThe Lost City of Atlantis\nThe lost city of Atlantis is alleged to be underneath the Bermuda Triangle, and the underground city is what causes the dangerous waves in the area. Plato estimated the lost city of Atlantis to have existed around 9600 BC, proclaiming it to be the greatest city that ever existed. Scuba divers often claim to discover the ruins every couple of years but alleged that their equipment gets lost before someone else watches it. An enormous crystal pyramid is said to attract cosmic rays which lead to the geographical disturbances in the region every now and again. These rays cannot be predicted by human instruments; thus random storms and freak waves destroy planes and ships without prior warning. Rumors of the finding of this crystal within Atlantis have been circulating since the 1960\u2019s when Dr. Ray Brown claimed to have found it while scuba diving. However, his photographic equipment was apparently destroyed in the storm. And he never saw fit to return to the site afterwards, which is highly suspicious. Though thoroughly debunked it still remains popular in paranormal conspiracy circles. This is partly because a formation called the Birmini Road was found in the region, and appears to be man made.\n2. ET forces at play\nPossibly one of the most popular theory about the Bermuda Triangle. Despite no actual evidence of Aliens, the alleged sightings and general belief in the existence of Extra-Terrestrials seems to be growing. And they are naturally linked to numerous conspiracy theories. Extra-Terrestrials love testing human subjects, and this is supposed to be their favorite spots to abduct humans. They also have the ability to teleport debris and other objects, which explains why none is found. Some Bermuda Triangle theorists have even gone so far as to call the area \u201cstar gate\u201d. This is tied into another theory, that the Bermuda Triangle is an Inter-dimensional Port which planes and boats fall through every now and again. Some have even speculated that the boats and ships are swallowed by wormholes and these wormholes open into the anti-matter counterparts of our world. Others claim that the portals are not inter-dimensional portals but are actually time portals, leading to different times in the existence of earth.\nAs far fetched as the Aliens theory is, it did begin with a strange occurrence in the Bermuda Triangle. In December 1945 a torpedo bomber named Flight 19 disappeared in curious circumstances. Flight 19 was the 19th flight of the same route in 19 days. It was a routine exercise for dropping bombs, the previous 18 having gone without incident. For unknown reasons the main pilot became convinced that the compass was not working correctly. They became disorientated and radioed in that they were lost. They were never seen or found, and it is assumed that they must have run out of fuel and crashed. This was what started the initial theory of Extra-Terrestrial activity in the area. While most theorists suggest that the malfunctioning compasses are the result of Extra-Terrestrial forces, many scientists have pointed out that there are a number of regions on earth where the compass does not actually point North. And the Bermuda Triangle is one of them. Thus when pilots claim that their compasses are going haywire it is not actually anything out of the ordinary but a common phenomenon in the Bermuda Triangle.\n3. The American Military\nNo conspiracy theory is complete without an appearance from an American military or intelligence organization. America did in fact build a base in the Bermuda Triangle in the 1950\u2019s. It is contended that the results of the experiments carried out by this underground research facility involves paranormal activity which in turn leads to interference with navigation controls.\n4. A Comet\n\nA comet (now a meteorite, as all comets which survive a crash are termed) crashed into the ocean floor of the Atlantic over 10,000 years ago. It now resides at the bottom of the sea. The magnetic waves emitted from this ancient comet are held to interfere with navigational components in air and naval vessels, which is what caused so many crashes in the region. Other lesser known theories in relation to the Bermuda Triangle include methane hydrate Deposits, pirates and gravitational fields, each of which are a little more down to earth but which still do not stand up to scrutiny.\nThe Mystery of the Bermuda Triangle: Put to rest\nHexagonal Cloud Air Bombs\nOne conspiracy theory which might actually be true about the Bermuda Triangle is that it does not really exist. The area experiences higher volumes that other regions in terms of air and naval traffic. It is an area where compasses are known to malfunction. Coupled with a somewhat dangerous geographical characteristics, it does not really seem that dangerous compared to similar areas on a statistical basis. The mystery of the Bermuda Triangle has been more or less solved. The region has hexagonal clouds which create air bombs of up to 170 mph, formed by what are known as micro bursts. When these micro bursts hit the ocean they can cause huge waves. And there is little hope of finding the wreckage of the planes and boats. The Puerto Rico Trench is over 8000 meters deep. On top of this the Gulf Stream passes through Trench, acting like a river to carry and dissolve debris to different locations.\nHowever, now that everyone has heard of the Bermuda Triangle, anytime that there is an accident of some sort it will receive media attention. In other words the Bermuda Triangle is a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nDocumentaries and Related Videos\nMystery of the Bermuda Triangle\n\nBermuda Triangle \u2013 The Real Truth\n\nBermuda Triangle Mystrey \u2013 Secret Revealed",

    "title": "Calliou",
    "content": "A viable Caillou Conspiracy Theory?\nRosie Caillou\u2019s Sister\nWhy does Caillou not have any hair? One of the main Caillou Conspiracy theories is that he is bald because he has cancer. Aware of the fact that he has Cancer and may not live to adulthood he lives through his imagination to imagine the things he would do if he had the chance to be an adult. This explains how he is allowed off on his own and gets away with so much, as his parents are sympathetic to the fact that he has a mortal illness. In the original books, Caillou gets hair as he grows up. Many watchers of the shown have questioned as to why the artist left Caillou bald as he aged, and there has to be an underlying reason. It is factually impossible for a child to become bald naturally before puberty. The sister Rosie, having Red hair, is held by some to be adopted, her parents both brown haired. Not able to bear the possibility of having another child with cancer, they sought adoption. This also accounts for the fact that the whole show is narrated by the grandmother, telling the story to Rosie who is asking who the boy in the picture is. Thus the entire show is a flashback, told in a melancholy voice by the grandparent. The clouds typically used for flashbacks on TV is also used in Caillou. All this is mere speculation. However, there are claims that the original artist of Caillou had a child who died of cancer. If this is true, then this is no longer a Caillou theory but is now firmly in the realm of probability. I was unable to verify this online. However, it stands to reason that if the original artist had a son who passed from cancer, then we can assume that Caillou also had cancer. We have a real life link and an underlying reason as to why Caillou was a bald child which also ties up other loose ends in the program. In other words, it makes sense. This is an actual viable Caillou Conspiracy theory. So much, so that\u2019s, it\u2019s no longer really a Caillou Conspiracy Theory. Just sound logic.\nNot so viable Caillou Conspiracy Theories\nCaillou\nThat\u2019s not to say that there are not countless Caillou Conspiracy theories that make no sense whatsoever. For each Conspiracy theory that may be true, there are dozens that are most obviously false and stem from logical fallacies. And if viewed on their own without having experience in logic they may even make sense on some level. They fill a gap that would otherwise be left unfilled, and human beings like to have everything explained. One such theory is that the story of Caillou is actually taking place within Caillou\u2019s mother\u2019s witness testimony. Apparently, the stories that can be heard on the show are her answers to the questions of the defense. This one appears online in numerous instances. No evidence is cited for this theory.\nCancer: Purgatory Caillou Conspiracy Theory\nConspiracy theorists love complexity and intrigue. Another theory is that Caillou not only HAD cancer but had cancer, died and went to purgatory. The show is now centered about Caillou living out the happiest moments in his life. The cloud-like mist is again cited in this theory, this time as evidence that Caillou is in purgatory. The narrator in this instance is not the grandmother of Caillou but is actually the voice of GOD. This goes to show how the same phenomena can be utilized in different settings as evidence to support a fact when there is actually no link between the two.\nThe Standard Theory\nThen there is the classic conspiracy theory. Caillou is, in fact, Satan running around, ruining American Values. Apparently, Caillou is programming children to become whiny, entitled humans who always get what they want. \u201cEvidence\u201d is cited of Caillou\u2019s interactions with his sister and parents as an example that he is the devil in disguise. This is a prime example as to how people can simply filter what they see and make theories which back up their views and beliefs. Why on Earth is Caillou designed particularly to destroy American values, when it was first produced in Canada? Possibly because most individuals believe that the world revolves around them, their country and whatever they hold to be most important. There is always a subjective element in Conspiracy theories, which are most often taken apart when observed with logical scrutiny.\nConclusion\n\nA general trend of all conspiracy theories is that they all seek to account for unexplained events. Humans need to have things explained to them, so they can make sense of what they see. If something is unexplained they will invent a theory to fill the unexplained gap, however crazy it may be, in order to maintain a sense of mental security. Artists generally tend to be creative and spontaneous, not rational and structured. Children often do unexplained things for no apparent reason. While this is totally rejected by those who need certainty, it may just well be that Caillou is bald just for the hell of it. It\u2019s a cartoon show based on the imagination of a 4-year-old child.\nDocumentaries and Related Videos",

    "title": "Clinton Conspiracies",
    "content": "It should be noted that there are two types of scandals involving the word email about Hillary Clinton. First is the Wikileaks release of 30,000 emails and attachments sent to and from Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server. The documents range from June 2010 to August 2014. The emails were made into PDF\u2019s at the request of the US State Department as a result of the Freedom of Information Act. The PDF\u2019s were made available in February 2016.\nThe FBI issued a separate investigation into Hillary\u2019s use of email for personal purposes during her time as Secretary of State. 33,000 emails were deleted from Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server, and the decision by the FBI not to prosecute Hillary Clinton led to a rift within the FBI.\nHillary Clinton Conspiracies\n1. Body Double\nOne Clinton Conspiracy gaining traction is that Hillary Clinton has a body double. This conspiracy exploded on the internet after Hilary stumbled/collapsed during a 9/11 memorial. This is not an allegation and has been caught on the footage. Hillary Clinton\u2019s doctor responded by saying that this occurred as a result of heat and dehydration. The footage does clearly show her having a medical episode of some sort, and while she did not fall had to be helped into the security van. Clinton Conspiracy proponents have been saying for years now that Clinton has had a body double and has not been well for some time. Alternative Youtube media channels such as the Young Turks point out that this is a \u201cconspiracy theorists dream come true\u201d . The stumble was cited as proof by Hillary Clinton Conspiracy Theorists that she is definitely ill and most definitely has a body double. It is true that she was diagnosed with pneumonia by her doctor and was on a regime of antibiotics. This, coupled with heat, dehydration and an intensive election campaign resulted in Hillary fainting during a 9/11 ceremony. While this is somewhat serious, this does not mean she is dying and most certainly does not mean that she has a body double. She was 68 years old during a very intensive campaign. After the collapse/stumble Clinton was rushed to her daughter Chelsea\u2019s apartment where she emerged a short time later, telling the Media she \u201cfelt great\u201d.\nAll this seems in line with what a prospective Presidential candidate would do, keeping the illness quite and powering through. After the collapse, the illness had to be revealed. Theorists have claimed that after she had emerged from her daughter\u2019s house, she had bigger earlobes, implying that this was a double and not the real Hillary Clinton. Her nose was also held to look different and her index finger bigger than her ring finger. One theorist has named the impersonator/Clinton double as Theresa Barnwell, who has been practicing for the past twenty-three years. Theresa Barnwell responded to the allegations on Twitter by tweeting that she was actually in Los Angeles at the time of the alleged impersonation. She also explains that she had to field questions from multiple newsagents and other sources after the conspiracy theory took off on social media. Summing up the reaction to the Clinton body double conspiracy, Barnwell had this to say: \u201dThree little words. People are crazy\u201d.\nThere are large of amount of photos online which are used as evidence by Hillary Clinton Conspiracy Theorists that she has a body double. References are made to Hillary\u2019s facial structure, such as her cheeks, smile, eyes, jaw and forehead. This is then compared to other pictures of Hillary, the differences allegedly being proof that she has a double. Other features noted are her legs and waist, held to be different at different times. This loses credibility on the ground that the pictures are not dated and people\u2019s weight changes over time. It is also worth noting that Photoshop can be used to edit photos. In sum, Hillary Clinton is ill. That does not indicate she has a body double.\n2. Brain damage\nKarl Rove\nThis theory was floated by Right Winger Karl Rove on Fox news after she fainted in 2012, and follows the previous body double theme that she is deathly ill. The statement was swiftly retracted but still took off on the blogosphere. It is not surprising that Donald Trump seemed to agree, stating that \u201cShe took a short-circuit in the brain\u2026.She\u2019s got problems. Honestly, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s all there\u201d. A picture released by Drudge Report titled \u201cHillary conquered the stairs\u201d showed a frozen picture of Hillary being helped upstairs to a house by her aides. The context of the photo was left out, taken in February and released at a time when it was trending to showcase pictures which present Hillary Clinton as an individual with serious health problems.\nOn August 2016, a Twitter account published apparent medical records which indicated that the \u201cPatient shows signs of advancing Subcortical Vascular Dementia after an MMSE was performed. The patient scored significantly lower on today\u2019s test than when tested in 2013. The patient is also showing signs of having more frequent Complex Partial Seizures\u201d. The account was deleted but the theory took off on Twitter. In 2015 TIME magazine published an article where Hillary was in \u201cexcellent physical condition\u201d to serve as President. The doctor who said this,\nDr. Lisa Bardack\nLisa Bardack was the same doctor in the leaked medical records made available on Twitter. The \u201cleaked\u201d document on Twitter is widely regarded as a forgery. They did not remotely resemble anything like medical records, did not contain a signature, did not contain a letterhead and there are significant formatting differences between the standard records Bardack uses with other patients. Dr. Lisa Bardack has publicly stated that the leaked documents are forgeries not produced by her. Another Media personality, Dr. Drew Pinsky, stated in a radio interview that he had grave concerns about her health and her health care, after reviewing her released health records. He also noted that she wore prism glasses to treat the double vision induced by the concussion-induced by the fall in 2012, stating this to be brain damage which was affecting her balance. He was widely criticized by health professionals for his claims.\n3. Parkinson\u2019s Disease\nAnother healthcare professional claims that Hillary Clinton has Parkinson\u2019s disease. Respondents to this claim point out the fact that while Dr. Noel may have 36 years of experience in medicine, he is an anesthesiologist and not a neurologist, the area which specializes in Parkinson\u2019s disease. Other responses are that Dr. Noel has never conducted a physical examination on Hillary Clinton and that his assertions appear to be dominantly partisan and not objective in the slightest, describing Hillary as \u201ca politician who lies about everything\u201d. Dr. Noel is also used as a source on sites such as Infowars, a notorious conspiracy theory blog. Alex Jones, the producer of the channel, stated with regard to Hillary Clinton\n\u201c She is an abject, psychopathic, demon from hell that as soon as she gets into power is going to try to destroy the planet,\u2026I mean, I was told by people around her that they think she\u2019s demon-possessed, okay \u201d\nDr. Noel does seem to be a straight conspiracy theorist, leaving the chance of an objective medical analysis quite slim.\nOther evidence cited by Parkinson proponents is that Hillary\u2019s head nodding is a clear sign of Parkinson\u2019s, as are her other odd physical movements. The head nodding has been countered as a facial tick which she has been doing for years when listening to people talk, as evidence on video. Her hand postures are said to be used to cover up tremors relating to Parkinson\u2019s, and the response to this is that her hands are used to emphasize verbal statements and that the movements seem quite natural.\nHillary Clinton Counter Conspiracy\nOne of the Hillary Clinton Counter Conspiracies is that all the Hillary Clinton Conspiracies simply stem from an ugly and deep rooted anti-feminist agenda. Counter Conspiracy proponents cite the fact that from the moment she stepped foot into the national spotlight in 1992 she has been the subject of criticism from the press, who are far too focused on how she appears in terms of dress code and fashion sense. Comparisons were often made to Barbara Bush. As a front runner in the worldwide evolution of women in politics, she was often analyzed in terms of how she looked instead of what she stood for, which might seem to be somewhat cruel. She was described as underweight, malnourished, in need of sunlight, badly dressed and someone who had definitely undergone plastic surgery by newspapers such as the Washington Times and USA Today. Rush Limbaugh and other right-wing outlets did multiple pieces as to how Hillary could allegedly not cross her legs. The health concerns are cited as anti-feminism in another form. In today\u2019s world of political correctness, it would not do to be openly sexist. So instead of publicly calling Hillary ugly anti-feminists, who are predominantly male, criticize her for her health issues as a way of expressing their anti-feminism.\n4. Child Sex Scandal\nThe New York Police Department found files on the laptop of Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin (Hillary Clinton\u2019s top aide) which show evidence of a political pedophile ring which Hillary Clinton is allegedly a part of. Anthony Weiner was caught sexting with a 15-year-old girl. NYPD sources also state that the emails contain evidence linking Clinton and her associates to Money Laundering, Child Exploitation, sex crimes with minors and perjury. It has also been alleged that the emails include travel documents relating to the travel itinerary of the Clintons and other members of Congress, who travel to the private island of convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. This revelation caused major upset to the Clinton campaign. FBI Director James Comey had previously told Congress that the investigation into Hillary\u2019s email server was finished but later reopened the investigation due to the findings on Weiner\u2019s laptop. There have been suggestions of a conspiracy within a conspiracy. The FBI have a history of caution near election day, and to release it so near the day showed a lack of character and an implication of foul play. Donald Trump tweeted that the system \u201dmight not be as rigged as I thought\u201d. There has been to date no proof or even concrete evidence of Hillary Clinton\u2019s link to a pedophile Ring in Washington. What is evident is the usual power struggles between dominant forces which are now more visible and transparent due to the rise of alternative media.\n5. Spirit Cooking\nThis Clinton Conspiracy has taken the internet by storm. And it is one of the more graphic of the Clinton conspiracies. The emails released by Wikileaks are particularly ominous and disturbing. One email sent by Marina Abramovic to Tony Podesta states\n\u201c Dear Tony, I am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking Dinner at my place. Do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining? All my love, Marina. \u201d\nAnother email shows Tony Podesta asking his brother John if he is available for dinner, saying Marina is asking whether or not he will be able to attend. John Podesta was the chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign. He had previously served as chief of staff to Bill Clinton. Another email sent from Hillary Clinton to Huma Abedin asked if Marina is still going to the dinner. Marina Abramovic was the author of a spiritual cookbook in 1996, titled \u201cSpirit Cooking with Essential Aphrodisiac Recipes\u201d. The book mentions meals consisting of \u201cblood, sperm and breast milk\u201d to be consumed on Earthquake nights. Another cooking recipe specifies fresh morning urine.\nTo conclude, most of the Hillary Clinton Conspiracies are false when investigated. The most likely Clinton conspiracy at present is actually the Spirit Cooking. While this may seem strange given the nature of the conspiracy itself, it is actually the only one where there is real tangible information from a reputable source \u2013 Wikileaks \u2013 and there does not seem to be a logical explanation other that Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin and John Podesta seem to like Spirit Cooking, a very bizarre ritual.\nRelated Videos",

    "title": "Coke Conspiracies",
    "content": "The Coca-Cola symbol is perhaps the most well known of Capitalism, along with Starbucks and McDonalds. Coca-Cola, or Coke, is manufactured by the Coca-Cola Company in Georgia, America. It was originally created as a medicine and evolved to become the world\u2019s most popular carbonated soft drink. The two main ingredients are kola nuts and coca leaves. The exact recipe remains a trade secret. The Coca-Cola Company sells the concentrate to bottlers in the U.S.A., who then add water and sweeteners before selling it to retailers. In 2014 Coke was sold in over two hundred countries worldwide.\nCoca-Cola and Science\nDr. Yoni Freedhoff\nIn 2015 Coke started backing a non-profit organization called the Global Energy Balance Network. This organization promotes the idea that Americans focus too much on what they eat and drink and should be paying more attention to exercise. This can be stated for exactly what it is. Coca-Cola are trying to deflect attention away from the role their product obviously plays in obesity and it\u2019s related diseases. The scientists associated with the organization stated that Coca-Cola had no say in the message given out to the public and had been transparent in their funding right from the start. This was later found to be false. The group\u2019s website also omitted mention of Coke\u2019s backing until Dr. Yoni Freedhoff, an obesity expert at the University of Ottawa, wrote to the organization to inquire about its funding. Dr. Blair said this was an oversight that had been quickly corrected.\n\u201cAs soon as we discovered that we didn\u2019t have not only Coca-Cola but other funding sources on the website, we put it on there\u2026 Does that make us totally corrupt in everything we do?\u201d\nThere us nothing new to see here, just a Corporation funding an organization where their interests happen to align, as Coke is coming under increasing pressure as the public become more aware of the dangers of sugary foods and High Fructose Corn Syrup (\u201cHFCS\u201d) in particular. In the last twenty years, the consumption of sugary drinks by American citizens has gone down by twenty-five percent. The influence that major food corporations have on apparently neutral health organizations is well documented, with strange funding arrangements and even reports of dietitians being bribed in order to present unhealthy snacks in a healthy way. Coca-Cola are now going even further, recruiting top scientists to promote their product for them.\nCoke: HFCS\n\nThe most probable theory about Coke is one involving the now infamous High Fructose Corn Syrup. Holistic experts and the organic health movement, in general, are strongly opposed to HCFS, prevalent in practically all processed foods. The majority of corn now manufactured in the U.S is genetically modified, and this is what is credited with the enormous surplus of corn. As the theory goes, the introduction of HFCS into the food supply was a great way for the corn farmers to make money and is a cheaper alternative for the producers, as well as giving the appearance of being more healthy than conventional sugar.\nNew Coke Conspiracy\nSome claim that \u201cNew Coke\u201d was an excellent marketing ploy introduced solely for the purpose of adding an extra ingredient to the recipe: High Fructose Corn Syrup. In the 80s Coke brought out a new flavor of Coke, called \u201cNew Coke\u201d. The idea was that Coca-Cola knew that no one would ever like the taste of New Coke. When the old supply of Coke ran out, people started demanding the release of old Coke, known as \u201cCoke Classic\u201d. And they brought it back. While this theory may or may not be true, it is true that HFCS was not an ingredient before the marketing of New Coke and was added as an ingredient when they went back to Coke Classic. It is still possible to get Coke original with sugar instead of HFCS. Corn is not kosher on Passover and the true formula is released for this date, the original formula. In Europe sugar is still used and HFCS is not an ingredient. And HFCS is and was cheaper than cane sugar.\nHowever the reality of claims that the entire marketing campaign was released to introduce HFCS without anyone knowing is much more mundane, and the opposite of what is claimed above. The Coca-Cola Manufacturing Company needed to address the fact that independent tests consistently showed that people preferred the taste of Pepsi, their main rivals, against Coke. In response to this, they formulated New Coke, and independent tests showed that it was significantly preferred to Coca-Cola Classic and Pepsi. This was what was really behind the \u201cploy\u201d, as before the introduction of New Coke tests showed that American citizens actually preferred Pepsi against Coke Classic. However in a bizarre twist, the public wanted Coke Classic back, because of the automatic tendency that old is always better than new, and Coke Classic formed an integral part of American identity. It was not to stand. The President of Coca-Cola Donald Keough publicly stated that:\n\u201cThe simple fact is that all the time and money and skill poured into consumer research on the new Coca-Cola could not measure or reveal the deep and abiding emotional attachment to original Coca-Cola felt by so many people . . . \u201c\nInterestingly, New Coke (now known as Coke II) has now faded away, highlighting the effect advertising and cultural conditioning have on all aspects of the psyche, the power of mental associations clearly triumphing over actual taste. Usually, with these claims, it is best to simply take the middle path between two extremes. As Keough later stated:\n\u201cSome critics will say Coca-Cola made a marketing mistake. Some cynics will say that we planned the whole thing. The truth is we are not that dumb, and we are not that smart.\u201d \nA More simple conspiracy\nThe constituents of Coke are primarily caffeine, salt and sugar. A rather simple theory is that caffeine is a stimulant as well as a diuretic which makes you urinate. The 55 mg of sodium per can makes the consumer thirsty. The sugar is used to hide the taste of the salt. The consumer then wants to keep drinking the product due to dehydration. This could be regarded simply as good business, the company not engaging in anything illegal. People are aware of the dangers of Coke at this late stage, and drinking two gallons of coke a day and blaming the Corporation is simply irresponsible.\nCokaine\n\nThere are many theories surrounding Coca-Cola and Cocaine. Some allege that the New Coke marketing campaign was introduced in order to get the last vestiges of Cocaine from the product before the Drug Enforcement Administration cracked down on the Company. Times Magazine did run an article on this idea and it is was endorsed by historian Bartow Elmore. It was done at a time when the Regan administration was running a war on drugs. All credible evidence indicates that the last derivatives of the Coca product was removed from the formula in the twenties.\nIt is true that the original product, Pemberton\u2019s French Wine Coca, contained cocaethylene, a mixture of cocaine and alcohol. It was not until 1929 that the formula was perfected, and before this time active compounds could be found in the soda. Cocaine was taken out of the formula due to racially promoted fears which may or may not have a basis in fact. The New York Times reported that:\n\u201cAnyone with a nickel, black or white, could now drink the cocaine-infused beverage. Middle-class whites worried that soft drinks were contributing to what they saw as exploding cocaine use among African-Americans. Southern newspapers reported that \u201cnegro cocaine fiends\u201d were raping white women, the police powerless to stop them.\u201d \nWhile Coke became cocaine free in 1929, it still contains the coca leaf extract. And this is where the heart of the Cocaine conspiracy theory lies. Allegedly Coca-Cola acts as a front for legitimately importing Cocaine into the United States. Apparently, over $21 billion of Cocaine is imported for processing by the Jersey-based Stephan Corporation, with an arrangement with the DEA who are given a cut of the profits. The merchandise is said to be hauled away to Mallinckrodt Missouri for processing. While popular on the web this theory is speculation.\nLawsuits against Coca-Cola\nIn 2001 a lawsuit was filed against Coca-Cola and two of their bottling companies. The case was brought jointly by The United Steelworkers Union and the International Labor Rights Fund. Eight members of the United Steelworkers Union were assassinated by \u201cdeath squads\u201d in the plants in Colombia. Coca-Cola said they had no ties to the bottling plants and that they committed no violation of human rights. Coca-Cola were found to have a 28% ownership in the direct owner of the two plants, FEMSA.\nThe killings are not disputed and did severe damage to the image of Coca-Cola. It cannot be disputed that the massacres of union workers in Columbia happen regularly, and it is the most dangerous place to organize in the world. Infowars, killercoke.org and the Stop Killer Coke campaign do a good job at highlighting how dangerous it is to organize a union in Colombia and how terrible it was for the families of the union victims, including orphaned children and estranged spouses. Horrific as it is, however, there is no definitive link between Coke and the murders. It seems inherently risky for Coca-Cola to purchase the services of the paramilitary in Colombia to go around mass murdering union workers. The question in the court case was whether or not Coca-Cola was responsible for the actions of the bottling plants, and a US federal court found that it was not.\nHowever, the campaign against Coke is not to be taken lightly and has gained consideration traction. Being a symbol of Capitalism may have once been good for generating revenue. Now Coke is targeted as a punching bag for anyone to vent their capitalist anger upon, a symbol of all that is wrong with the world. Colombia Vice President Juan Carlos Galvis has stated that:\nIf we lose this fight against Coke,\nFirst we will lose our union,\nNext we will lose our jobs,\nAnd then we will all lose our lives!\n\nA similar court case ensued in 2010 after trade unions and their families were harassed, raped and murdered in Guatemala in connection with Coca-Cola bottling plants. In Turkey in 2005 over one hundred Coca-Cola workers who unionized had their contracts terminated. While protesting Turkish riot police attacked the protesters who had assembled peacefully. In Mexico, Coca-Cola has been shown to have short changed the Mexican government, fire employees who refuse to carry out illegal activities and cheat Mexican workers out of their money. On top of this, they allegedly negotiated 27 water concessions from the Mexican government, eight of which are for the right to dump toxic waste into the waters, and 19 for the extraction of water from aquifers and rivers, some of which belong to indigenous peoples. In India, suicide rates among farmers are on the rise due to the Coca-Cola related destruction of their livelihoods. The operations of Coca-Cola uses too much underground water which results in a dry surface where crops cannot grow. In El Salvador and China, Coca-Cola is linked to slave labor and child labor. Multiple reporters have claimed that in China, in particular, workers toil in awful conditions for slave wages. While individually these claims may falter, the sheer level of international consistency to the reports of Human Rights abuse at the hands of Coca-Cola bottling plants needs to be investigated. While it is not conclusive that Coca-Cola organizes actual attacks on union workers, it would surely be more appropriate for courts to rule that Coca-Cola is responsible for the actions of its bottling plants. This would ensure that the killings stop whether it is directly responsible or not.\nConclusion\nThe link between Coca-Cola and Scientific organizations are ominous. The public relies on health advice from independent groups in order to gain information about what to consume, and this could be the start of a dangerous trend. If the public cannot get decent health advice due to Corporate manipulation, then society is in a precarious position.\nCoca-Cola is a dangerous organization. Aside from the usual claims involving Illuminati symbolism and Cocaine in the beverage, there is plenty of real worlds actual evidence to encourage caution with the company. Studies have shown links between the consumption of HFCS and the emergence of diabetes and fatty liver disease. It is addictive and not good for the body. The sheer amount of claims by different organizations in different countries, as well as investigative reporters is cause for concern. While there is no conclusive link or findings, to say that Coke have not committed any criminal activity is naive in the extreme given the sheer amount of controversy generated.\nCoca-Cola Documentaries\nCoca-Cola is a very powerful company and they take their brand image very seriously. That could be the reason there aren\u2019t many professionally shot documentaries; no certainty but it is a possibility.\nCoca-Cola: The Real Story Behind the Real Thing\n\nBurp! Pepsi v Coke in the ice cold war (1984)\nThis one isn\u2019t necessarily about the conspiracies we mentioned, however it is interesting to see the competition between the two giants.",

    "title": "Cubs 108 Conspiracies",
    "content": "Cubs 108 Conspiracy \u2013 Branch One\nThe first branch of the Cubs Conspiracy centers around the number 108. Essentially because it is associated with the Cubs Victory, links are related to numerology and destiny/fate. The following are facts or pieces of Trivia that can be associated with The Cubs victory in 2016, given by Grant Deporter.\nGrant Deporter\nGrant Deporter had previously paid $113,000 for a baseball which was used in the Cubs defeat in 2003, to have it destroyed on live television. This was done to eliminate \u201cthe Curse of the Billy Goat\u201d. While Deporter focused on the number 108, his previous research concentrated on the number 8.\nThe following information was cited by Deporter before the Cubs victory.\n\nBack to the Future II is a 108-minute long movie. The Cubs win the Series in this movie\nTaking Care of Business is a 108-minute long movie. The Cubs win the series in this film.\nThere are 108 stitches in a baseball. The first ball was designed by the initial Cubs manager. His office was on 108 W. Madison Street.\nThe Cubs owners made its fortune through TD Ameritrade, which has its headquarters located in Omaha on Avenue 108.\nCubs games are broadcasted from a tower that is 108 stories tall.\nIt takes a total of 108 outs to win the World Series.\nCubs Pitcher Jon Lester was born in the 108th largest city in the U.S\n\nDeporter also predicted that Baez would hit a home run on pitch 108 against the Giants in the first game of the National League Division Series. Baez then blasted the 3-2 pitch, propelling the Cubs to a 1-0 victory. Deporter says that 108 is a spiritual number and predicted that the Cubs were destined to win. And he was right.\nThe problem with all such numerology related Conspiracy Theories is as follows. Analyze any data set and you are going to find patterns. Given that the whole of life is a large dataset you are going to find patterns everywhere. There is no concrete evidence to support Deporter other than a random occurrence of the number 108 which is associated with the Cubs. Take any club and analyze the dataset for a significant period of time and you are going to find numerical patterns. You can take any worldwide victory across any sport and associate it with a number and create a conspiracy theory out of it. This is because the dataset is infinite and without parameters. Numbers and patterns are everywhere.\nCorrelation versus Causation\nA well-known fact in Science is that Correlation does not mean Causation. Just because a variable, in this instance 108, is linked to an event, in this instance the Winning of the Series by the Cubs, does not mean that the variable caused the event. What is impressive is that Deporter predicted this confidently on live television. If he repeats something of this nature again, this rationalist will have to start listening to Deporter and delve deeper into Numerology.\n\nUntil then, this can be regarded as a fluke, however impressive. The hallmark of science is that the phenomenon be repeatable and observable, and until that happens it cannot be validated. The Cubs 108 Conspiracy, along with many other conspiracies, could be resolved if it\u2019s proponents simply understood basic patterns and the difference between correlation and causation.\nBranch Two\n\nThe second element of the Cubs Conspiracy relates to the general theme of Illuminati Manipulation, symbolism and all events being rigged and known in advance. Proponents may cite the fact that the Baseball pitching corner is akin to the Free Mason Symbol, a sign of mass distraction to the masses. All the games are allegedly rigged from the outset and are saturated with symbols designed to control the subconscious as part of a carefully designed system. Theorists would make reference to the word itself, base meaning low and baal begin a reference to the Phoenician god of fertility. Again the symbolism falls prey to the same illogical assumptions as the numerology. It has no parameters and there are infinite things it could be related to in an infinite dataset. Thus the theories get very wild and non-verifiable. Such as the following:\n\u201cThe game on the diamond was played out so that the accuser(pitcher) could not rule over man, but the law would. The accuser stands upon the mound 66 gilgul, or the place of the skulls. This is also the same spot as the masonic \u201cG\u201d in the square and compass design. So the accuser stands in the place of God or \u201cGrand Architect\u201d as the masons call it. The accuser\u2019s dominion is the cycles of birth and rebirth, or if you are counting, 60 feet 6 inches. The accuser stands upon the mound to split the accused(batter) in two. He is trying to rule over the batter by accusing the batter. The accusation splits the batter in two.\u201d\n\nConcluding the Cubs 108 Conspiracy\nThe numerology can be explained with simple statistics and the fact that patterns will be found given an infinite dataset. The symbology is a little more difficult, not because of it\u2019s logical fallacies which are the same as those of numerology but simply because of the regular appearance of the symbols across all areas. On the 26th of June 2016 in a game between the Chicago Cubs and Milwaukee Brewers on Chicago\u2019s WGN network, Illuminati symbolism flashed up on screen.\n\nThis was recorded and uploaded by many viewers. The symbols included the eye, the inverted pentagrams and the hammer and sickle. Again, while correlation does not imply causation, the proliferation of this type of symbolism on live mainstream networks has to be questioned, albeit skeptically.\nOther Related Videos",

    "title": "Digital Television ",
    "content": "\u201cthe ultimate Big Brother scenario whereby the majority of Americans and Europeans will have Orwellian telescreens watching their every move\u201d\nHe stated this in response to a Youtube clip which revealed a hidden camera inside a digital converter, and the internet took off. Later the video producer admitted the video was a hoax. The switch from Analog to Digital\u00a0was not any type of mass conspiracy. It was, however, further evidence of an incompetent and inefficient government. $1 billion dollars spent on \u201cDigital Coupons\u201d for poor people to get Digital Televisions, of all things? A bizarre waste of money and a strange priority for an administration to have, ensuring that every house has a television, particularly when TV is on the way out in any case as people turn to smaller portable devices and laptops where they can stream online for free, and get access to alternative media. Technology does quite well in becoming cheaper and more efficient all by itself when open sourced and unsupervised by the government, who tend to make everything worse.\nA platform for Mind Control\n\nSome of the more radical conspiracy theorists have formulated their own theory in relation to the introduction of the television. The television allows a centralized platform where information can be disseminated into the living room of every house in the world. Thus it is advocated as a mind control system. The stories propagated do not have to be true, they can be completely made up and the public would be none the wiser, particularly in an age where pictures, videos and sound can easily be edited. However, it is the theorists who are more often at the end of the previous statement that the official authorities, as the claim that television is all a mass propaganda campaign is a little far out.\nThe people who believe that television is no more than a tool to control the masses are usually the same people who believe that 9/11 was staged, that Aliens rule the world and that every natural disaster is caused by Elites using HAARP technology to depopulate the planet and enrich themselves. Thus there is little in the way of common ground for debate.\nImminent psychologist Alan Watts, among others, have commented on the bizarre nature of modern society, where people go to homes after work and, instead of socializing each worker goes into his/her respective homes and sits watching a 2 dimensional screen of pixels instead of interacting with wider society. Theorists take this a step further and argue that the television was designed such that it would break up society, making it more artificial, and also provide a platform for propaganda to be spread to the masses.\nEffects of Mass Media\n\nWhile the introduction of the Digital Television may not have been orchestrated and controlled by the Elites, as contended by radical theorists, the effect that television has on mass consciousness cannot be avoided. In the 1950\u2019s the three main American TV networks created shows which appealed to family values. At the time families would gather together in the sitting room to watch these shows. The shows outlined the conservatives values of white middle class life. Of course even within the small segment of the white middle class it did not constitute an accurate representation of life for the typical family, not to mention the families of all the different minorities and African Americans in particular.\nToday the shows and options are much more diverse, and there are a range of appliances for watching shows and movies on the go. But the theme has remained the same. Shows are still being aired which portray an image that the consumer imagines or accepts is the standard. The consumer will inevitably try to reach this standard and fail because it is an ideal, a TV show can only be an inaccurate reflection of human life. Thus there are shows such as Suits which encourages bright eyed graduates into the legal profession, as apparently all they do is wear fancy suits and negotiate million dollar agreements. And it results in women who actually try to adhere to the commonly found \u201cdemented prostitute\u201d look simply because it is what is in vogue, as well as actively starving themselves because they think that this is what they are \u201csupposed\u201d to do. And at present the rise of something called \u201cskinny jeans\u201d has caught on and sadly not among women. To the disgust of those born in the leather jacket wearing era of the 70s and 80s male Millennials have been convinced/conditioned/programmed that altering their sexuality to become more cosmopolitan is what\u2019s in vogue. If people can be conditioned to believe anything (and apparently they can) then the Television is a dangerous appliance, and it may be prudent to watch what is mentally consumed.\nConclusion\nWhile not an Illuminati mind control agenda the results of mass media on individuals can be just as devastating. There is no need to construct some crazy conspiracy theory when your children spent 10 hours a day hooked to a screen of some sort. And while the claim of Digital Television being introduced solely for the purposes of spying on the masses is ludicrous, it should be remembered that there is a mass surveillance operation in force whereby the NSA actively spies on U.S citizens as a matter of National Security, and that is not a theory.\nDocumentaries and Related Videos\nMass Media Conspiracy Lies, Hoaxes & Manipulation",

    "title": "Elvis Presley Faked His Own Death",
    "content": "Few iconic stars die without someone claiming that there was a conspiracy involved, and Elvis Presley is no exception. Elvis Presley was a singer, actor and one of the biggest cultural symbols of all time, known as the \u201cKing of Rock and Roll\u201d. Born in Mississippi, he started playing music at an early age and is one the biggest influences of 21st Century Music. Elvis Presley has an estimated sales count of 600 million units worldwide, winning three Grammy awards and is included in many musical halls of fame.\nThe Decline of Elvis Presley\n\nBy 1973 Elvis was becoming increasingly unwell, and his health was deteriorating. His divorce took place in October of the same year. He spent time in a coma after overdosing on barbiturates. He became addicted to pethidine and was frequently hospitalized. Despite all this 1974 was his busiest year in terms of shows and tours. However, he was unable to perform effectively due to his drug addiction. Fellow guitarist John Wilkinson recounted:\n\u201cI watched him in his dressing room, just draped over a chair, unable to move. So often I thought, \u2018Boss, why don\u2019t you just cancel this tour and take a year off\u00a0\u2026?\u2019 I mentioned something once in a guarded moment. He patted me on the back and said, \u2018It\u2019ll be all right. Don\u2019t you worry about it.'\u201d\nElvis did not enter the studio in 1974. However, despite his health concerns and drug addictions, he went on to do fantastically well in the charts. He recorded Six Albums between 1973 and 1976, Five of which entered the top 5 of the charts, and Three went to number One. Eight singles from this period were top ten hits on the charts. 1977, however, spelled the end for Elvis Presley. Journalist Tony Scherman writes that by early 1977:\n\u201cPresley had become a grotesque caricature of his sleek, energetic former self. Hugely overweight, his mind dulled by the pharmacopia he daily ingested, he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts.\u201d\nHe stuck to most of his touring commitments; however, he was barely understandable in his performances. His final concert was held on June 1976 in Indiana. At this point, he was suffering intensely from various ailments induced in large part by his drug addiction, continually prescribed to him by his doctors. These ailments included glaucoma, high blood pressure, liver damage, and an enlarged colon. On August 16, 1977, his girlfriend found him unresponsive on the bathroom floor, before he was scheduled to fly out on another tour in Memphis. Doctors were unable to revive him, and he was pronounced dead at 3:30. From the time of the death of Elvis Presley, there have been many alleged sightings of the rock and roll Icon and the theory that he faked his death is popular among many fans.\nElvis Presley faked his Own Death\n\nPerhaps one of the most outspoken (though not one of the first) proponents of the death of Elvis Presley is Gail Brewer-Giorgio, who wrote a book titled Is Elvis Alive in 1988. The book reached Number 8 on the New York Times Bestseller List. She also wrote a follow-up book called the Elvis Files in 1990. Some of the questions raised about the death of Elvis in the books include\n\nReports of numerous sightings in locations such as Kalamazoo and Michigan.\nA wax dummy in the coffin of Elvis Presley reported to have started to melt due to the heat at the time.\nThat when Elvis was brought to the hospital in August in 1977, a nurse looked at him and said: \u201cThat\u2019s not Elvis Presley\u201d (The nurse allegedly received a warning from the Government not to say anything about the reveal the cover up).\nThat Singer Gloria Estaphan received a phone call from Elvis Presley while lying in hospital recovering. Gloria\u2019s number was private, and only somebody like Elvis would be able to attain it.\nElvis\u2019s father, Vernon Presley, had the death cert sealed after his death. This will become available to the public in 2027, 50 years after his death.\nThe cause of death was reported to be the result of a heart attack but was since changed to that of an accidental drug overdose.\nThe gravestone spells the name \u201cAaron\u201d; however, Elvis spelled it \u2018Aron\u201d.\n\nWhy would Elvis Presley fake his own death? Well, there is an underlying motivation. He was deeply unhappy and needed to escape. He was also reported to have been very lonely and isolated, stating that:\n\u201cI mean there has to be a purpose\u00a0\u2026 there\u2019s got to be a reason\u00a0\u2026 why I was chosen to be Elvis Presley.\u00a0\u2026 I swear to God, no one knows how lonely I get. And how empty I really feel.\u201d\nAnd he carried many books on spirituality with him everywhere. Faking his own death could have been an escape method to get away from it all, Elvis having been famous from a very young age.\n\nAn alternative theory is that Elvis was forced to fake his own death and is currently in hiding due to pressure from \u201cThe Powers That Be\u201d (TPTB). These powers are also said to be responsible for his drug use, and the theory is usually linked in with cloning which would tie in with the nurses claim that \u201cThis is not Elvis Presley\u201d when he was brought in for treatment.\nConclusion on Elvis Presley\u2019s Death\n\nThere is no evidence to indicate that Elvis Presley is alive and well, aside from the claimed sightings which are inevitable. And the death of such a renowned and international figure is bound to lead to reports of sightings and related theories. The most likely scenario is that he died from the well-documented amount of drugs he was taking. He was practically unable to sing at his concerts from 1973 onward and was chronically overweight. What is more surprising is that he was stayed alive for the time he did while still producing such iconic records.\nDocumentaries and Related Videos\n1.

    "title": "Fidel Castro Revolutionary",
    "content": "1. Trudeau is Fidel\u2019s son\nJustin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada\nOne outlandish conspiracy which emerged in relation to Fidel Castro was that the Canadian Prime Minister was Castro\u2019s son. The theory emerged after the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, described Castro as a larger than life leader and a remarkable figure. He also stated that he met the news of Castro\u2019s death with \u201cdeep sorrow\u201d. These are rather strange remarks for a violent dictator known for multiple cases of abuse of human rights. However, there is no concrete evidence to indicate any type of relationship between Castro and the Canadian Prime Minister.\nProponents of this theory have claimed that there are facial similarities between Castro and Justin Trudeau. It is also alleged that Trudeau\u2019s mother had extramarital affairs with individuals in the Rolling Stones and US Senator Ted Kennedy. This nonverified piece of data is used as evidence by Fidel Castro Conspiracy theorists that because she potentially had relations with political figures, she must have had a relationship with Fidel Castro.\nOther pieces of trivia are cited as evidence of a Fidel Castro Conspiracy. Fidel Castro was 6 feet 3 inches, Justin 6 feet 2 inches and Justin\u2019s father 5 feet 8 inches. Fidel Castro attended the funeral of Pierre Trudeau. Margaret appreciated that Castro took an interest in her child upon the state visit.\nWhile there may be truths in some conspiracies by and large the conspiracy group, suffer from a deficit of sound reasoning. While it is true that Margaret Trudeau referred to Castro as \u201ca very warm and charming man\u201d, to jump from this and say she had an affair with Castro is ludicrous. As with a number of conspiracies, it just consists of pieces of information which presented in a certain way could hint that it may be true. Upon further investigation it is unsubstantiated.\n2. Operation Northwoods\n\nOperation Northwoods was a government plan to start a war with Cuba by killing its own civilians and destroying military targets. The results of these acts of terrorism would then be blamed on Cuba which would justify an invasion. The basis for these claims is a document drafted by the US Department of Defense. This report is available online at the National Security Archive following an investigation by the John Francis Kennedy Assassination Records Review Board. Castro had at this time removed former Cuba Prime Minister Fulgencio Batista and allied Cuba with the Soviets. And after multiple assassination attempts, an economic blockade and the Bay of Pigs failure came a more extreme plan to\n\u201cplace the United States in the apparent position of suffering defensible grievances from a rash and irresponsible government of Cuba and to develop an international image of a Cuban threat to peace in the Western Hemisphere\u201d.\nProposal Four of the Memo gets very dark, suggesting a terror campaign against Cubans living in the States and outlines a plan to sink boats full of Cubans on route to Florida. It states that\n\u201cThis plan\u2026.should be developed to to focus all efforts on a specific ultimate objective which would provide adequate justification for U.S military intervention. Such a plan would enable a logical build up of incidents to be combined with other seemingly unrelated events to camoflage the ultimate objective and to create the necessary impression of Cuban rashness and irresponsbility on a large scale, directed at other countries as well as the united states\u201d\nand also:\n\u201cHarassment plus deceptive actions to convince the Cubans of imminent invasion would be emphasisied. Our military posture throughout execution of the plan will allow a rapid change from exercise to intervention if Cuban response justifies. 2. A series of well coordinated incidents will be planned to take place in and around Guantanamo to give genuine appearance of being done by hostile Cuba forces.\u201d\na. Incidents to establish a credible attack (not in chronological order)\n\nStart Rumours (many). Use clandestine radio\nLand friendly Cubans in uniform \u201cover the fence\u201d to stage an attack on the base.\nCapture Cuban(friendly) saboteurs inside the base.\nStart riots near the base main gates(friendly Cubans)\nBlow up ammunition inside the base\nBurn aircraft on air base\nLob mortar shells from outside of base to base\nCapture assault teams approaching from the sea\nCapture militia group which storms the base\nSabotage ship in harbor; large fires \u2013 naphthalene\nConduct funerals for mock-victims (may be in lieu of 10)\n\nKennedy turned the proposal down, going against numerous high-ranking officials. The chilling document is available online at the National Security Archive and does propose acts of domestic terrorism and starting a campaign of terror against Cubans.\n3. Castro hand in JFK Assassination\nBrian Latell\nAnother prominent Fidel Castro Conspiracy is that Castro had a hand in the assassination of John F Kennedy. A retired CIA officer claimed that the Cuban leader ordered intelligent officers to listen for news from Texas on the morning of the shooting. After the famous assassination of J.F.K official sources indicated that it was a communist sympathizer acting alone, Lee Harvey Oswald. Retired CIA official Brian Latell points in his book that Castro told officials to listen for \u201cany little detail from Texas\u201d. This is a first-hand account of what Latell states he heard. He (sensibly) makes no claim that Castro had a hand in the Assassination of J.F.K whatsoever, just that he heard that Castro asked for any news from Texas on the morning of the shooting. As Latell states in his book everything that he says is actually backed up by on the record sources. Latell also details in his book the efforts of the CIA to remove Castro, including poison pens and other booby traps. He also states that after J.F.K. was assassinated the efforts were called off.\n4. US Economic Collapse\nThe fourth Conspiracy theory centers around the standard prophecy Conspiracy Theory. The recent death of Castro has revived interest in this prediction. \u201cProphet\u201d John Johnson allegedly claimed in 1981 that after the death of Fidel Castro there would be a complete collapse of the U.S economy. This has actually sparked interest due to the election of Donald Trump, a probable collapse of the European Union as of the time of this writing and concerns about the global financial infrastructure and the global balance of power. He also claimed to have predicted the collapse of the Berlin Wall and that Russia would rise again after being knocked back by the U.S. He believes a devastating nuclear strike from the Soviets against New York City and a Chinese attack on the West Coast are imminent. He does not give any dates for his predictions; He just states that X will happen after Y. He does seem to have accurately predicted that Fidel Castro would die after the re-emergence of the Soviet Empire, but this is a rather vague prediction, and he has made many.\nFidel\u2019s Conspiracies\nFidel Castro\nFidel Castro is himself a conspiracy theorist. He is known to believe that the 9/11 attacks were an inside job. He also believes that the Bilderberg group is comprised of the world\u2019s Elites whose main agenda is planetary depopulation and world domination.\nIt is also claimed that he was the victim of Assassination attempts by the CIA for decades, from explosive cigars to Thallium. This is plausible, as it makes sense that the CIA would try to get rid of Castro, what is more, surprising about this is that they didn\u2019t actually get it done given a practically infinite amount of resources.\nCastro was one of few people who managed to seriously upset the U.S.A. and die peacefully in his bed. He set up a socialist experiment and Allied Cuba with Russia, the greatest nemesis of the U.S. all in close proximity to the United States. He also defended the bay of pigs as commander against superior forces. On the other hand, he was also a violent dictator who sent many to death or prison and had little regards for basic human rights. A hero for some a villain for many, all depending on your point of view.\nDocumentaries and Related Videos\nFidel Castro \u2013 BBC\n\nCuban Revolution\n\nCastro-CIA connection\n\nBay of Pigs Invasion what really happened?",

    "title": "Flight 800",
    "content": "Flight 800 Testimonies\n\nThe conspiracy theory that originated from the destruction of flight 800 centers around a flare that hit the aircraft. Multiple testimonies from eyewitnesses in the days after the explosion of Flight 800 indicate that they say a bright orange light was coming from the water skywards towards the plane. 183 people were reported to have seen the streak of light heading towards Flight 800. Of the 102 who gave information 96 said it originated from the surface. The direction of travel was reported by the eyewitnesses to be not only vertical but also horizontal towards Flight 800. Practically all testimonies agree that it was a bright, flare-like object ascending, and not descending.\n\u201cI know what I saw. I saw an ordnance explosion. And whatever I saw, the explosion of the fuel was not the initiator of the event. It was one of the results. Something happened before that which was the initiator of the disaster.\u201d\n-Frederick Meyer, Air National Guard helicopter pilot and witness of the Flight 800 event 29/7/97; Riverside Press.\nAll testimonies from these eyewitnesses were given to the FBI. The official verdict from the FBI was that the eye witness testimonies summing up to 183 people could not possibly be correct. Therefore the testimonies of the eyewitnesses were disregarded. They were not allowed to speak at the public National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s (NTSB) investigation into the explosion after FBI Director James Sanders said they could not be relied upon. The conclusion of the NTSB is at odds with 94% of eyewitness testimonies, concluding that the streaking light seen by the eyewitnesses was the plane itself. The NTSB never found out the cause of the explosion. They did arrive at the conclusion that fuel vapors in the tank ignited causing the initial explosion, but never found the cause.\n\u201cMore than 150 credible witnesses \u2013 including several scientists and business executives \u2013 have told the FBI and military experts they saw a missile destroy TWA 800. \u2018Some of these people are extremely, extremely credible,\u2019 a top federal official said. \u2018When we asked what they saw and where they saw it, the witnesses out east pointed to the west, and the people to the west pointed to the east\u2019.\u201d\nThe New York Post, September 22, 1996.\nMissile Explosion\nOne of the more prominent, popular and evidenced theories about Flight 800 was that it was downed by a missile and subsequently covered up by officials. Three separate samples were taken from the wreckage of Flight 800. Testing on each of these three samples are consistent with the presence of explosive residues, from the combustion byproducts of a military solid fuel rocket motor. The NTSB did not uncover the source of the explosive residues that were found. Thus is was unable to conclude any wrong doing. Note that this is not indicative of any type of foul or suspicious play on behalf of the NTSB. If no conclusive link can be found, then no conclusions can be drawn.\nJames Sanders, Author, The Downing of TWA Flight 800\nMuch of the information relating to a possible government cover-up was brought to public attention by journalist James Sanders and his wife, a TWA flight attendant. Sanders published a book in 1997 titled The Downing of TWA Flight 800 proposing that the flight had been brought down by a missile with an ensuing government cover-up. Sanders and his wife Elizabeth were prosecuted by the Federal government for theft of government property after they took evidence from the crash site, along with documents, to expose a potential cover up. Both were convicted. Sanders authored the second book in 1999, Altered Evidence.\nFlight 800 and the Navy\nThere are other factors cited as odd by the Flight 800 theorists. The immediate introduction of the Navy who replaced the divers of the New York Police Department, who had jurisdiction over the area. They swept up to twenty miles either side of the aircraft, though it was not possible for the flight to make it anywhere near this far given it\u2019s altitude, even if left intact. The Navy stated that the sweep was necessary in order to locate the black box/aircraft flight recorders, which could not be found. Numerous vessel owners said that they got pinged by the box on their radar dishes. When the black box of Flight 800 was found it was directly at the crash site. It has also been claimed that the Navy lied about the presence of submarines, initially stating there were none present only to retract these statements and later admit to 3 under water vessels. If a military training exercise actually did go wrong, this is most likely how official sources would react. They are not going to publicly apologize for blowing up a commercial airline\nFlight 800 and the CIA stimulation\nMany theorists have speculated that the simulation used by the CIA was fake. Retired United Airlines Pilot Ray Lahr was a prominent critic of the zoom climb and it\u2019s calculations, used to produce the simulation. He filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to gain access to this data. He publicly stated that he could prove that the zoom climb never happened if he got access to the data. The court granted his request under the FOIA to gather the necessary documents from the CIA and associated agencies. He was never given the documents as the agencies claimed all documentation had been lost.\nOther Theories\nOne theory contends that a Bolide, which is a large meteor, exploded as it hit the Earths\u2019 atmosphere. One of the fragments of the Bolide then intersected Flight 800. It does cover a lot of unresolved data points. However this is a trend seen in all theories, conspiracy or not, that invent something that would satisfy the unresolved elements, with no way of actually proving that it led to those elements. In any case it has been criticized due to the improbability of one of the fragments intersecting the flight\u2019s path.\nAnother theory relating to Flight 800 is that High Intensity Radiated Fields produced by military aircraft was the cause of the explosion. This was also deemed unlikely.\nThe International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAMAW) also took part in the study conducted by the NTSB. They commended the NTSB for their focus and commitment but proposed that the NTSB should have focused more on the lower left side of the plane. They strongly criticised the handling of the investigation by the FBI, stating that the TAG database used to analyze the accuracy of testimonies from the witnesses was grossly inaccurate and that they acted outside of their jurisdiction when they removed evidence from the hangar without going through the proper procedures.\nWilliam Donaldson, retired Naval officer\nWilliam Donaldson, a retired Naval officer, produced the \u201cDonaldson Report\u201d two years before the conclusions of the NTSB were published. The report purported that two missiles fired from the water collided with Flight 800. It also made the point that never in the history of aviation (at that time) had a mechanical failure led to the ignition of kerosene in a fuel tank. Whereas Sanders believed in the possibility of an accidental launch by the Navy, the Donaldson report deemed a terrorist attack more likely. Both theories agree on a government cover-up.\nFlight 800 Conclusion\nDefinitely one of the more conclusive\u00a0conspiracy theories, there were numerous eyewitness accounts which were simply disregarded, no reasonable explanation as to why an aircraft would simply explode and discrepancies from official sources. While no definite conclusions can be drawn there was definitely something curious about how Flight 800 came to its end.\nDocumentaries\nHere are some useful documentaries and recreations you will find useful to watch about TWA Flight 800. Although there may be other documentaries or recreations about the incident, we try to include the most important ones here.\nTWA Flight 800 Conspiracy\n\nTWA Flight 800 Remastered Re-creation\nThere has been an ongoing trend of recreating the incident as a documentary, especially with the air-crash conspiracies.\n\nFeature Documentary \u2013 Silenced: Flight 800 And The Subversion Of Justice\nThe title says it all\u2026\n\nConspiracy 1/11 \u2013 TWA Flight 800",

    "title": "Global Warming",
    "content": "Greenhouse Effect\nSunlight from the Sun passes through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and then rebounds off the Earth\u2019s surface upwards. Most of this infrared upward heat energy is absorbed by Greenhouse Gases. Much human activity leads to an increase in the levels of Greenhouse Gases in the atmosphere. The increased levels of Greenhouse Gases result in an increase of infrared heat absorbed and thus the climate of the greenhouse that is planet Earth, leading to an increase in temperature. Most Climate scientists believe that the increase in the Greenhouse effect is what results in an increase in Global Warming. The main gasses that contribute to the Greenhouse effect are Nitrous Oxide, Carbon Dioxide, Methane and Water Vapor. Fossil Fuels are cited as the worst offenders in increasing the amount of Greenhouse Gases (GHG\u2019s) in the atmosphere, as they result in an increase in Carbon Dioxide. Thus the focus on Climate change has been on renewable sources of Energy.\nGlobal Warming is a scam\nIt goes without question that the majority of people do believe in Global Warming. But it\u2019s not quite as far out as Alien Reptiles and Mind Control. There is considerable evidence to the contrary by reputable, scientific and political figures. There are some facts about Global Warming which make the worry about Global Warming sound quite preposterous\n\nThe rise in temperature since 1850 is only .8 degrees. The majority of this warming happened before the 1940\u2019s, which entailed a significant increase in the industrial burning of fossil fuels.\nComputer Models based on the Greenhouse Theory have never been verified by temperature records. If a theory contradicts reality, the theory must be wrong.\nThe earth has been at a higher temperature for 95% of the time in the last 100 million years.\nThere have been previous times when the temperature has risen at a faster rate than what it has done in the past century. This includes 10,000 years ago when it rose 6 degrees in a decade.\nThe other planets in the solar system are warming, and these planets obviously have no human activity and thus no increase in Carbon Dioxide. Therefore the most likely cause of the increase in Global Warming is an increase in solar irradiation which is causing all planets to heat up.\nAnti-Climate Changers will also often reference the fact that there is simply no way of knowing how hot or cold the Earth was when historical records were not present, and there was surely no way to measure the level of Greenhouse Gases and other chemicals in the atmosphere.\n97% of the Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere is accounted for by nature, and not by human activity. Termites emit more CO2 than all the factories and cars in the world. Natural wetlands emit more GHG emissions than all human activities combined.\nIn 2014, the hottest year in Earth\u2019s history, the Antarctic Ice Caps were larger than they have ever been.\nRetired NASA atmospheric scientist John Casey has revealed that human activity has had relatively little impact on global temperatures.\nThe findings of a NASA study have found that Earth has actually cooled in areas of mass industrialization, the implication being that the burning of fossil fuels actually cooled the areas.\nIn the Ordovician Age, the Age of Ice, CO2 emissions were twelve times larger than they are today.\n\nThe response to the idea that the ice caps are melting is that the ice caps have always melted. The Earth spins on its axis, with more water in the Southern Hemisphere and more land in the North. There is a constant search for equilibrium with an accompanying oscillation. Over the next 20 years, the water in the Arctic will once again solidify to form the Ice Caps. And this was also what led to the scare in the 1980\u2019s of Global Cooling, albeit by a minority of scientists.\nAnother theory is that Methane is a much more important GHG than CO2 in relation to Global Warming. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have indicated that Methane is 86 times more potent at warming the atmosphere than CO2 if a 20-year time horizon is used as opposed to a 100-year time horizon. The 100-year time horizon that influences policy makers indicates that Methane is roughly 21 times as potent as CO2. There is an effort underway to influence policy makers to use both time horizons, so the effects of Methane are not underestimated. Methane only lasts in the atmosphere for 12 years, whereas CO2 lasts for up to a century to be broken down. There are claims that Livestock are more responsible than factories, cars or airplanes for global warming, due to the level of Methane emission.\nGlobal Warming is not caused by GHG emissions\nIt has been claimed that even though Climate change is real, it has not been caused by GHG but by other factors. Solar Irradiance has been cited as a possible factor which could have led to an increase in the Earth\u2019s temperature. If the temperature of the sun rises, it is only reasonable to assume that this will affect the temperature of the Earth. However, there is much evidence that this Solar Irradiance is not the cause of Global Warming. First, the temperature of the Sun has remained much the same in the last 3 centuries. However, the theory underpinning Global warming is that there has been a rapid rise in Temperature in the last couple of decades. Second, any scientific models that have tried to replicate Solar Irradiance cannot account for the increase in Temperature unless GHG\u2019s are included.\nLeighton Steward, Geologist\nThe author of New York Times BestSeller Sugar Busted has contended that Carbon Emissions are actually good for the Earth and that reducing CO2 levels would actually be harmful for the environment. He points out the fact that while the current levels of Carbon Dioxide may be at 338 parts per million at present, in U.S Navy submarines the danger level is not reached until it reaches 8000 parts per million. He contends that the increase in CO2 levels is due to the recent rise in temperature, and is not causing it. There is scientific evidence showing that CO2 levels are spiked after increases in temperature. Steward believes the reasons for the Global Warming has been Solar Irradiation.\n\u201cThere have been similar and even larger warmings several times in the 10,000 years since the end of the last ice age. These earlier warnings clearly had nothing to do with the combustion of fossil fuels\u2026.. The current warming also seems to be due mostly to natural causes, not to increasing levels of carbon dioxide. Over the past ten years there has been no global warming, and in fact a slight cooling. This is not at all what was predicted by the IPCC model\u201d \u2013 William Happer, Princeton Physics Professor, testimony to Senate 2009.\nThis is actually incorrect, as the arming trend has exploded recently, which is best accounted for by the burning of fossil fuels and the demonstrably higher levels of Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere. Happer was at the time a chairperson for Conservative George Marshall Think tank, which received over $1,000,000 between 1997 and 2007 in grants from Exxon Mobile, an organization with massive fossil fuel holdings. Exxon Mobile is currently under public scrutiny as it\u2019s private scientists actually discovered that fossil fuels are leading to global warming and it hid the research discoveries.\nIt has also been contended that water Vapor is the major player in climate change and not CO2/Fossil fuels. The basis for this is that NASA studies have confirmed that water vapor plays a larger role in the increase or decrease or the earth temperature. However water vapor is a function of the earth\u2019s temperature, it does not cause Earth\u2019s temperature. Thus water vapor will have an amplifying effect of a temperature increase caused by an increase of CO2 from fossil fuels. An important response to this, however, is that all the computer models which project global warming based on this amplification have never been historically verified, even with higher levels of CO2. Again, should a theory contradict reality, the theory must be wrong?\nGlobal Warming: A tool for the Elites\nAny major topic is inevitably linked to Illuminati control. The idea is that global warming is a mass conspiracy where the science has been conducted fraudulently. What is notable is that prominent politicians and scientists seem swayed. Republican Senator James Inhofe claimed in his speech to the Senate claimed that:\n\u201cWith all of the hysteria, all of the fear, all of the phony science, could it be that man-made global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people\u201d\nDonald Trump 2012 tweet:\n\u201cThe concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive\u201d\nJoe Coleman, Founder of the Weather Channel:\n\u201cThe greatest scam in history. The polar ice is increasing, not melting away.\u201d\nOn top of this more than 31,000 scientists, including over 9000 Ph.D.\u2019s, signed a petition in 1997 that Global Warming is a hoax, and that there should be no limits on GHG emissions. Petition Purpose: to demonstrate that the claim of \u201csettled science\u201d and an overwhelming \u201cconsensus\u201d in favor of the hypothesis of human-caused global warming and consequent climatological damage is wrong. No such consensus or settled science exists. As indicated by the petition text and signatory list, a very large number of American scientists reject this hypothesis. It is interesting that Climate change scientist Bill Nye states that a climate change conspiracy would have to involve more than 30,000 people and that this is simply not possible. However, the 31,000 scientists who signed a petition indicating that Climate Change to be a hoax were deemed to have simply been part of some strange anti-climate change conspiracy theory.\nInefficiency\nA major criticism of the Climate Change Industry is it\u2019s inefficiency. Even aside from the science of whether or not Climate change is real, the economic effects are absolutely disastrous. The Climate change Industry \u201cwastes\u201d up to $1.5 Trillion a year in taxpayer money. This is a very, very large amount of money even on an international scale. It is almost the same as the total amount spent on the online shopping industry. And it is argued, mainly by businessmen, politicians and industrialists as opposed to conspiracy theorists that the costs are quite simply unjustifiable. And with quite good reason. Wind mills are often cited as an example of the inefficiency of Climate Change. Wind Energy would not survive without government subsidies because no-one would pay the extortionate price for them. As stated by Warren Buffet:\n\u201cWindfarms do not make sense without the tax credit.\u201d\nFrom a project that is supposed to be more environmentally protective, windfarms kill birds and bats (Bats are an environmentally protected species which reproduce very slowly), are unreliable, cost far too much money and destroy the landscape. The Windmills themselves are not even environmentally friendly.\nThe most optimistic scenario in support of Climate change as indicated by the UN Climate Conference Paris COP 21 was that if all the plans were implemented there would be a .170 reduction in Climate change by 2100. This is ridiculous on quite a number of levels. If this money ($1.5 Trillion) was invested in space travel or technology, the problem would be resolved far before then.\nGlobal Warming is Obvious and Real\nMany of the claims made above can be countered by the Climate Change Proponents. It\u2019s not that there have not been times that the Earth\u2019s climate has been warmer, this is not disputed. It\u2019s the speed at which the Earth\u2019s Climate is heating up. Eight out of the last 10 years (As of 2016) have been the warmest in Earth\u2019s history. There have been more hurricanes, droughts, earthquakes, wildfires and flooding in general. Sea levels have risen twice as much in the last decade as they have in the last century. Ice Caps, Glaciers and he Arctic Sea Ice are all shrinking. The amount of carbon dioxide is increasing by about 2 billion tons per year. There is too much evidence to indicate that the world is heating up and is causing these phenomena.\nBill Nye, a scientist famous for debunking Global Warming Conspiracy theories, says that it would require at least 30,000 people to keep the Climate Change Conspiracy a secret(if there was one), which is just not plausible. By examining the ice cores, the amount of Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere can be assessed, as these ice sheets are hundreds of millions of years old. In much the same way the age of a tree can be calculated by examining the number of rings the log has. There are simply not enough volcanoes to account for the level of Greenhouse Gases we are seeing today. Total emissions from Volcanoes account for less than a hundred of even human emission of CO2, and this claim is completely unfounded. Even if the potency of Methane was previously underestimated, there is simply not enough Methane in the atmosphere to suggest that it is the most significant contributor to Greenhouse Gases.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that human activity, mainly industrial, has resulted in Carbon Dioxide increase from 280 parts per million to 400 parts per million in the last 150 years. The Panel also concluded that GHG were the primary cause of the increased temperatures over the last 150 years. The Panel consisted of over 1300 independent scientific experts from around the world.\nSolar Global Warming\nThe idea that other planets in the solar system are warming is deemed to be inaccurate. In Jupiter, no warming has been observed, and the alleged warming is due to predicted levels of warming, not historical. There is simply not enough data to claim that Pluto is undergoing Global Warming. There were only two observations made in 1988 and 2002. This is equivalent to observing the weather patterns of Earth for 3 weeks out of the year and then extrapolating on yearly temperatures. It is the least understood of all planets with the least data. There is simply not enough current or historical data to say that any planet in the solar system is undergoing climate change, aside from Earth. Pluto and Neptune are showing an increase in brightness, which is possibly related to an increase in temperature. There is not enough data to make claims for the rest of the planets.\nHuman Emission v Natural Emissions\nIt is true that the level of CO2 emitted by humans compared to nature is tiny. However this has been misrepresented by theorists who state that CO2 emissions by humans do not matter. Before the Industrial Revolution, the amount of CO2 in the land and sea was relatively stable, there was a natural balance between the two. Carbon is generated by some processes and absorbed by others. But outside of the natural cycle, 6 billion tons of carbon are emitted each year into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels. There is no longer any balance and Earth needs to compensate. The Land and the ocean cannot absorb all of this CO2 without compromising in some fashion. While up to 40% is absorbed the rest remains in the atmosphere, and year on year the levels in the atmosphere increases, contributing to global warming. Atmospheric CO2 levels are the highest they have been in over 20 million years.\nCO2 v Methane\n\nWhile Methane is far more potent than CO2, there is 200 times more CO2 in the atmosphere than there is Methane. CO2 levels are at 338 parts per million whereas Methane levels are at 1.75 parts per million. Methane is estimated to account for about 25% of what CO2 does in terms of Global Warming. However, the secondary effects of Methane have not been extensively studied. Oxidation of Methane is the main source of water vapor in the upper atmosphere, which amplifies the effect of global warming induced by CO2. Methane also ultimately breaks down to CO2 after roughly 12 years.\nMany tie the Agricultural factor into Global Warming. As per the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Agriculture accounts for up to 18% of the total amount of GHG emissions. This figure is bigger than the whole transportation sector. Livestock now occupies up to 30% of all the Earth\u2019s surface. Livestock is linked to deforestation as rainforests are cut down to make way for grazing pastures and other agriculture-related processes. It requires much less land to feed people off plants as opposed to animals, and up to 95% of all beef that is produced is sourced from feedlots or Concentrated Animal Farming Operations (CAFO). Thus elimination of meat from the diet is considered the best way to reduce carbon footprint as it will save on Methane, CO2, Nitrous Oxide, Chemicals and Preservatives, the rainforest, your health and the life of an animal. Einstein:\n\u201cNothing will benefit human health and increase chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet\u201d\nA \u201cNeutral\u201d View\nIt is without question that the world is heating up, at a rapid pace. The increased number of natural disasters, melting of the ice caps, rise in sea level and shrinking of glaciers is most definitely associated with the rapid increase in temperature. It is, at the very least, the most probable cause at present to explain the phenomena we are currently seeing. There is no conspiracy theory; Climate change is a complex topic, and thus has led to debate and controversy. However it\u2019s effects are not as well known or studied as often claimed, and it is definitely blown out of proportion.\nAll projections made about Global Warming are done with the assumption that CO2 output levels remain the same, and conditions stay the same. However, Technology is increasing at an exponential rate. Which means that any day now a means of energy could be invented that is renewable and renders the whole fossil fuel dilemma completely redundant. Any model which aims to predict the future has failed, and despite what is told projections to the years 2040, 2050 and beyond are simply ridiculous. Because no matter how logical and sensible the theory is at the present time, in a couple of years new findings will render the past projection completely invalid. New technologies/game changers/black swans will emerge to spin the theory off or generate a new way of looking at things. This happens in medicine, physics, economics and practically every profession. And Climate change is a no exception.\nFinally, the approach by politicians and governments to \u201cbattle\u201d Global Warming have been a catastrophic disaster and a complete and utter waste of money. The amount of money spent is unjustifiable, the attempt to generate renewable energy through windmills a miserable failure and no notable progress made whatsoever.",

    "title": "HAARP Technology",
    "content": "The HAARP Facility\nHAARP antenna array\nThe HAARP facility is located in Alaska, covering 13 hectares of remote terrain. A large part of the research facility is covered by high-frequency antennas that are capable of sending up to 3.6-megawatt signals up into the ionosphere in order to cause a disturbance which are then observed and recorded. The program cost the government $30 million to put up and it costs 5 million a year to maintain.\nHAARP Conspiracy Theories\nThere are many conspiracy theories blaming HAARP for various calamities and disasters, proposed not only by conspiracy theorists but also by notable world leaders such as former Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez. The European Union has also expressed its concern about the true nature of the project and encouraged the formation of an independent regulatory body to look into the program. However, the US refused to cooperate and stood by their word that the program was harmless, which ultimately added fuel to countless HAARP conspiracy theories.\nMain Theory\nThe main theory lies on the effects of energy waves from the facility antennae which are directed to the ionosphere. Conspiracy theorists believe that these rays are then reflected back into the earth on a very low frequency called ELF waves, which have serious effects on the Earth\u2019s magnetic fields as well as on human thoughts and emotions. They believe that ELF waves can cause rapid heating of the earth\u2019s atmosphere, change wind patterns and can be used to alter moods and brainwash entire populations. These waves are also strong enough to affect the tectonic movement of plates, which is why the program was blamed for floods, earthquakes, air crashes, and other global disasters that happened since its inception.\nCalamities\n\nThe most recent tragedy that theorists blame on HAARP was the fatal crash of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370. The fact that no trace of the plane or bodies of the passengers were ever found further fuels the mystery. Many believe that the plane may have gone off course because its radar systems were affected by the radio waves being emitted by HAARP antennae.\nStrange natural disasters and the intensity in which storms, typhoons and earthquakes are occurring are also being attributed to HAARP. The 2011 Japan earthquake which was apparently accompanied by a sudden and unexplained rapid heating of the ionosphere directly above the epicenter of the quake is leading theorists to believe that HAARP may have been responsible for the quake and the ensuing tsunami that occurred.\nManipulation of Human Thought and Emotions\nThe project has also been believed to have developed the technology to affect human thought and emotion. Theorists believe that the program was successful in identifying emotion signature clusters in EEG signals and frequencies which were then stored in computers. When needed, they are placed on Silent Sound carrier frequencies that could trigger the occurrence of the emotion carried in that frequency in another human being anywhere else in the world.\nOf course, HAARP personnel are adamant about telling the public that there is nothing top-secret or classified about their activities. Before the official website for the project was closed down in 2013, it\u2019s spokesperson reiterated that there was no secret research going on in the facility. Others are also skeptical at how conspiracy theorists seem to blame everything on the project, no matter how implausible these may sound.\nCurrent Status\nThe US Air Force notified Congress in 2014 that they are shutting down the Alaska facility after 21 years of operation.\nThe shut-down is reportedly due to budget cuts and the fact that they no longer find any useful purpose for the project. However, a number of universities are interested in utilizing the property for research since it is still fully operational. Although many still believe that the program conducted studies that were perhaps too sensitive to divulge to the public, it\u2019s termination may just cause a few of these theories to die down.\nHAARP Documentaries\nHAARP And Everything It\u2019s Used For\n\nWhat is HAARP?\n\nH.A.A.R.P.: (The beginning of the end)",

    "title": "Hurricane Katrina",
    "content": "Hurricane Katrina \u2013 Disaster Response\n\nIt is generally accepted that the response from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was not up to an acceptable standard. FEMA director Michael Brown and New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Eddie Compass both tendered their resignation in response to a barrage of criticism after the poor responses from the respective agencies. Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco also came under fire. Brown testified that Blanco had not requested coastal parishes in Louisiana to be included in a State of Emergency, which he says he found shocking. This was later found to be incorrect on Brown\u2019s part. In response to increased reports of looting in the aftermath of the disaster, Blanco did state that;\n\u201c They have M16s and are locked and loaded. These troops know how to shoot and kill and I expect they will \u201d\nThis was at a time where people did not have access to basic amenities such as food, water and transport. Several shootings occurred between civilians and the emergency police forces. In one incident two unarmed civilians were killed. 11 police officer appeared in court in relation to the shootings. Blanco also refused to let the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) take over operations, saying that her National Guard could manage.\nThere is little argument that the response to the disaster was itself a disaster on all levels, and that political power struggles did not alleviate the problem in any way. The conduct of police officials was less than stellar. The National Guard was commended for it\u2019s response.\nHurricane Katrina \u2013 HAARP\nAny sort of natural catastrophe in the US is linked to HAARP by conspiracy theorists. HAARP construction began in 1993. HAARP stood for High-Frequency Active Auroral Research Program and was dismantled in the summer of 2014. The purpose of the program was to analyze the ionosphere to develop enhancement technology for radio and satellite. It is jointly funded by the US Air Force, the US Navy, the University of Alaska and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The year that funding for HAARP was at it\u2019s highest was also the year that three savage hurricanes also hit the US, prompting theorists to claim that HAARP had the ability to control the weather. There are also claims that HAARP led to the Flight TWA 800 explosion as well as to earthquakes in Thailand. Theorists claim that HAARP was used to enhance hurricane Katrina to a category 5 hurricane and that it traveled in a straight line as opposed to most other Hurricanes, which travel in random paths. There is no science to back up these theories. As with most conspiracy theories, David Icke posted an article on his website alleging that Hurricane Katrina was steered into New Orleans.\nAll conspiracy roads lead back to one of two sources \u2013 Alien Reptiles and Illuminati Control. Claims from many theorists indicate that the Illuminati use HAARP as a tool to control the minds of the masses via shortwave radio communication. The counter argument to this case is that HAARP waves are too short to be measured.\nHowever an extremely well-respected and mainstream physicist Dr. Michio Kaku has publicly stated on CBS News that weather modification is possible by the government. While he does not mention HAARP outright, it may bring the theory a little bit more towards the center.\nHurricane Katrina \u2013 A Corporate Plan\n\u201cBy the time Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, and the nexus of Republican politicians, think tanks and land developers started talking about \u2018clean sheets\u2019 and exciting opportunities, it was clear that this was now the preferred method of advancing corporate goals: using moments of collective trauma to engage in radical social and economic engineering.\u201d\n-Naomi Klein The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism\nThe idea is that the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina was utilized by Corporations and Politicians to grab even more money and power. And this is a fact that cannot be debated. It was just an opportunity that was capitalized upon by\u2026Capitalists. Nothing out of the ordinary. But perhaps not the most ethical of maneuvers by the business owners. However, this goes further when HAARP technology is used as a tool to orchestrate the disaster in order to give more profits for oil tycoons and business owners.\n\nThe underlying rationale behind this sinister theory being that millions of the black underclass were displaced following the aftermath of Katrina, their property reclaimed by land developers. Insurance does not cover natural disasters. And they were unable to return due to bureaucracy and law enforcement, many of the former housing sites toxic debris fields yet to be cleared up years after the disaster. Conspiracy theorist claim that this synthetic disaster was a war mainly on poor and black people, whereas others propose that Hurricane Katrina was orchestrated as an experiment in fear and anarchy. The incompetence of government authorities is cited as being a concerted effort to do nothing as opposed to a lack of communication and organization. Liberals who emphasize with the socio-economic plight of underprivileged black communities will never go as far as to consider a concerted effort within government to keep these communities oppressed. They will then view people who agree with them for a different reason as conspiratorial in their reasoning.\nIt has also been alleged by homeowners near the levees, which were supposed to withstand a category 4 hurricane (Katrina being a category 3 when it hit New Orleans), that they were intentionally blown up during the flooding. This was also referenced in Spike Lee\u2019s documentary \u201cWhen the Levee\u2019s broke: A requiem in Four Parts\u201d. Supposedly the levees were blown to in order to flood the poorer areas while leaving the upper class districts intact. The question of course is whether or not the sounds of the explosion were due to the levees breaking due to underwater controlled charges or due to the levees breaking under the force of the water.\nOperation Blackwater \u2013 Hostile Defense Contractors\n\nAccording to some reports, DHS security contractors set up headquarters in New Orleans before the Hurricane hit, and claimed they had authority to use \u201cwhatever force they deemed necessary\u201d to secure law and order. The important point being these were contracted security forces and not national authorities. This seems to imply that the security forces already believed that the city was going to turn into a war-zone and went in with a mindset of defense and brutality. It was reported in The Times that while all civilians were ordered to turn in all weapons, this did not apply to private security guards employed by the wealthy to secure their property.\nThe term \u201cKatrina Time\u201d was given to immigrants and blacks who were randomly arrested following the instigation of martial law in Katrina\u2019s aftermath. Dave Eggers recounts the story in his book Zeitoun of a Syrian immigrant who was arrested for organizing makeshift relief efforts and rescuing people in his boat. He was questioned as a terrorist. Katrina time was made possible due to the prevailing conditions at the time, with no due process or standard of proof. Most of the accusations of rape, police brutality and looting were deemed to be false by mainstream Media outlets at the time of the Hurricane. Since then there has been an onslaught of anecdotal evidence which indicates the contrary.\nHurricane Katrina Conclusion\nWhile HAARP, Illuminati mind control and concerted government action all form part of a typical conspiracy theorist\u2019s arsenal, the claims of police brutality are well documented and historically verified. The political emphasis on maintaining law and order as opposed to helping the needy created a terrible atmosphere for violence and conflict. There have been many accounts of racism and brutality by people with guns in positions of authority. Sadly when these people are additionally given license to kill by the governor and told that the location is going to be a war-zone, it is going to lead to innocent deaths, which is most likely what happened taking into account standard human psychology.\nHurricane Katrina Conspiracy Documentary\nMost of the conspiracy documentaries about Katrina were Amateur style.

    "title": "Hurricane Matthew Conspiracies",
    "content": "Matt Drudge\nThe Hurricane Matthew Conspiracy began with a tweet from Matt Drudge, author of Conservative Media outlet DrudgeReport.com, tweeting\n\u201cThe deplorables are starting to wonder if govt has been lying to them about Hurricane Matthew intensity to make exaggerated point on climate\u201d on October 6, 2016 (The deplorables is a reference to Hillary Clinton\u2019s previous description of Trump supporters during the election).\nA few minutes later he followed up by tweeting\n\u201cHurricane Center has monopoly on data. No way of verifying claims. Nassau ground observations DID NOT match statements! 165mph gusts? WHERE?\u201d.\nDrudge was quickly slandered by Climatologists and U.S Politicians, with many on Twitter suggesting that perhaps Drudge should take a trip to Florida. There does seem to be a particular segment of the population, who are in fact Trump supporters, by and large, inclined to believe that climate change is a hoax. The takeaway from the tweet by Drudge was that it was an act of patriotism for \u201cDeplorables\u201d to ignore the warning and stand up for a version of personal justice against the government.\nRight Wing Agendas\nRush Limbaugh\nRight Wing Conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh also weighed in on the situation, albeit in a more balanced way, linking it to politics and votes. Hurricane forecasting depends on political and electoral factors because there are votes. As he states, there is politics in the weather, politics in the forecasting of the weather and politics in hurricanes, because there are votes. The underlying Hurricane Matthew Conspiracy is not whether the government made the whole thing up and there being no danger whatsoever. The Matthew Conspiracy is comprised of whether or not the government exaggerated the effects of the speed of the hurricane and the damage that it would cause. This is somewhat plausible, though improbable. Even Climate change denier Donald Trump urged Florida residents to take shelter from Hurricane Matthew. This was not a straight left v right issue, as many conservatives urged residents to take shelter, including Fox News anchor Shepard Smith.\nThough the fallout from Hurricane Matthew was far less than the dire warning issued by the government, there is little to back up Drudge\u2019s claim that the Hurricane was intentionally exaggerated (Aside from the fact that the incident itself was far less vicious than described). Practically all independent meteorologists warned about Hurricane Matthew. A useful technique might be to ignore all the political babble and left v right dialogue and get the information about people who actually specialize in the area. We are concerned about reports of people deciding to stay in zones of mandatory evacuation orders,\u201d said meteorologist Brian Norcross. \u201cThis is a mistake, this is not hype, this is not hyperbole, and I am not kidding.\u201d Norcross also warned against Hurricane Andrew in 1992.\nUnfortunately, the problem with most conspiracy theories is that they are unprovable. As all official figures are manipulated, as are all official statements, we live in a world of lies and agendas where to truth has to be fought for. So proving or disproving a conspiracy theory can often be like trying to run through a lake: nothing is solid. Thus we will never be able to prove that the hurricane itself was exaggerated by the media to advance the profile of the elites. The Hurricane Matthew Conspiracy, like other conspiracies, cannot be validated.\nSummary\nThere is little doubt that the Government had to issue warnings to the Florida residents to prevent a catastrophe. The storm claimed many lives and billions of dollars of damage in Haiti, whose infrastructure will not be the same for decades, an already impoverished country. A direct hit on Florida would have been catastrophic. From the point of view of government officials and indeed any person in a position of power who is responsible for the lives of others, safety is the top priority. It would have been far worse if the warning was mild and thousands of people lost their lives. It was a Category 5 Hurricane and led to 49 deaths in the US, causing over 10 billions of dollars of damage. To conclude a warning was clearly and obviously justified: Public statements like \u201cyou and everyone you know are dead \u2014 all of you \u2014 because you can\u2019t survive this\u2026 and your kids die too.\u201d by influential figures are inappropriate and serve only to cause mass hysteria and are little more than pointless fear mongering.\nYou may also want to check Hurricane Katrina Conspiracy\nRelated Videos",

    "title": "The Illuminati",
    "content": "New World Order\nThe term \u201cNew World Order\u201d is the term used to describe modern efforts of the 21st century Illuminati. The New World Order relates to a system of world wide totalitarian government. The theory goes that the Illuminati want a unified world where they control all the resources. Thus their would be a new world where everything would be centralized. One government, One Currency, One set of Laws, One Education System, One Media Outlet. In this fashion it would be easier to govern. Centralization would make it easier to control the masses. If people were all to go through the same education system, with the same laws, and watch the same media and use the same currency, then they will by and large be the same products produced from the same system, if the psychological theory that we are all products of our environments happens to be true.\nDecentralization\nDecentralization is the anti-thesis to much of the plans of the New World Order/Illuminati as it is not possible to control multitudes of sovereign states. As soon as one rebellion is quashed another would start, thus the identity of the sovereign state would have to be diminished via a \u201cwe are all one\u201d propaganda campaign. The destruction of the identity of the countries leads to subservience under the guise of unity. British futurist and writer H.G. Wells described the plans of the New World Order as synonymous with that of a centrally planned socialist worldwide state in the 1940\u2019s. If this was the case then Brexit and the election of Donald Trump in the United States was a huge setback to the globalist agenda, where countries would become unions and federations and then merge to become one world organizations. The New World Order was mentioned by Woodrow Wilson, George Bush and Winston Churchill in various instances, and is perhaps one of the more plausible of the Illuminati Conspiracy links.\nControl Via Finances\nLinked heavily with the Illuminati Conspiracy is that of the Bankers enslaving the world through debt. Debt slavery is not a new phenomenon, and many people firmly believe that debt is necessary for financing and that more wealth is created through debt policies. The economic framework upon which the West relies is called Keynesianism, and it\u2019s basis is that via the issue of debt, more wealth is generated as spending money increases the Gross Domestic Produce of the economy. The main opposition group to this theory is the Von Mises Institute. Proponents of Von Mises believe that spending money stimulates the economy in the short term only, and that all Keynesian roads end in Recession. Aside from Economic theory there appear to be more sinister concerns.\nThomas Jefferson\n\u201cI believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered.\u201d \n\u2014 Thomas Jefferson, 1802\nThe financial world is based upon derivatives and the banks ability to lend out far more money than they actually have. It seems to be akin to a magic trick, as they effectively loan out money that does not actually exist. On this loan is generated debt, thus the banks actually profit by lending money which has not been created, generate income on the debt via interest, and really cash in when there is a recession, repossessing houses at a fraction of what they are worth via lending money they never really owned by power granted to them via an elite aristocracy. The ongoing war on cash is further evidence that there is something deeply wrong in the financial industry. This would be how the conspirators phrase the links between the Illuminati and the banking scandal, and while there is quite a lot of things wrong with the banking system, a more nuanced view might take account of the fact that some amount of capital is needed to generate wealth, just nowhere near the unprecedented levels they are at right now.\nWho are the Illuminati\nPhoto by MIKI Yoshihito. (#mikiyoshihito) on Trendhype / CC BY\nMany celebrities, financiers and members of the aristocracy have been claimed as Illuminati members including Jim Carry, George Soros, Lady Gaga, The Pope, Barack Obama, Queen Elizabeth, Kanye West, Ben Bernanke, Bob Dylan, Rihanna and Beyonce. Needless to say the claims need to be taken with a grain of salt. The reasons behind the claim vary greatly. One of the main claims is that of the symbolism typically associated with the Illuminati. This explains the inclusion of celebrity members such as Lady Gaga and Jay Z. The video for one of Lady Gaga\u2019s releases, born this way, features a goats head which is allegedly representative of the god Baphomet. Most relate to the previously mentioned symbols. Donald Trump and Barack Obama are both allegedly member of the Illuminati because both have used the sign of the horns.\nThe exact members of the Illuminati are unknown due to the vague meaning of the term \u201cIlluminati\u201d. It can be said that there is a ruling elite pulling all the strings. But there has to be a distinction made between the real elites of the 13 royal families and the mere politicians and presidents who operate as mere fronts for these individuals. More likely there are entities known as SPI\u2019s (super powerful individuals) who are completely unknown to the public and belong to the 13 great families, the same ones who interbreed for the sake of genetic purity in order to harness certain traits. The main traits being ruthlessness, cleverness, deceit and lack of compassion. A distinction is going to be made between the Illuminati which a number of politicians and power individuals are members of and the real SPI\u2019s who pull the strings. So, we can say that there is another level in terms of conspiracy theory \u2013 The Illuminati as a group whose presence is thrown out as a distraction, and the real players behind the scenes who the public know nothing about, and quite possibly never will. They are just too good at what they do and hold every single card imaginable.\nThat said, there are quite a few members of the Illuminati if the gestures and language are anything to go by. The latest celebrity figure to be identified as an Illuminati member due to this hand gesture is none other than Donald Trump, for use of the Devil Horns sign. Pretty much every president has made this sign, from Clinton to Bush and possibly all the way back to JFK. Angela Merkel, Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker are all accused of being Illuminati members due to their use of the inverted pyramid and the all-seeing eye. However, many of these can be viewed with scrutiny. There are only a certain number of ways that hands can be folded together, and over time some similarities are going to be found over the course of many, many pictures of various politicians. The alternative would be to keep the arms folded forever. Many people have certain tweaks and tendencies and to say they are members of the Illuminati merely due to a certain hand sign is na\u00efve. And theorists are eager to interpret any and all hand signs as evidence that the individual in question is a member of the Illuminati. One such dubious query is where Vladimir Putin is innocuously scratching his nose, somehow linked to the Illuminati. Barack Obama has also been accused of being a member of the Illuminati due to his frequent use of the Sign of the Horns (El Diablo).\nThe Devils horns can be given much more credence than the inverted pyramid, which usually involves wishful thinking on behalf of the theorist. Because the Devils horns is not a casual and normal gesture. It requires an uplifted and specific gesture that is not natural. This is different from having the fingers touching together in front, (the pyramid) which serves as somewhere to keep the hands while thinking or talking. On top of this is the strange fact that practically every single US President has used this unnatural upward hand gesture. Trump has been caught using the Devils Horns, all seeing eye and A Ok sign.\nThe Real Illuminati Family\n\n\u00a0\nWho are the real Illuminati family? It is becoming known that the elites are comprised of 13 ruling families who interbreed. This interbreeding is associated with the Satanic bloodline of those who worship the devil and perform blood rituals in order to gain specific powers such as longevity. These 13 families control everything. From the banks to the media to the government to Hollywood to celebrities. They are commonly known as the 1% which is a little misleading. Perhaps the .0001% would be more accurate. Personally, I believe that even the key members of these families are kept well-hidden and even behind these key families are even murkier and more powerful entities who will never be revealed. You only get fed the information that you are meant to see, even if that information is top secret and just leaked. This point notwithstanding these families do wield huge influence and are in control of much of the globes wealth, with control of key global politicians and corporate entities, both of which are viewed as their property.\nIt is generally accepted that the 13 families do not work together. While there may be a loose place to work together to subjugate the masses it is truly not just every family but really every individual for him or herself. Little less could be expected from such ruthless families. And this is the way that the young of such families are brought up to be as ruthless, cunning and self-serving as possible. It goes without saying that it would be hard to subjugate the world to darkness and impoverishment while simultaneously being a humanitarian. The two ideals are at odds. That said, many of the alleged Illuminati members are the most charismatic, likable and intelligent members of society, the ones least suspected of being capable of committing unspeakable actions. Examples would include Ted Bundy and JFK. According to popular theory, they 13 Illuminati families are as follows:\nThe Rothschilds\n\u201cI care not what puppet is placed on the throne of England to rule the Empire. The man who controls Britain\u2019s money supply controls the British Empire and I control the British money supply.\u201d\n\u2013 Nathan Mayer Rothschild\nThe Rothschilds are perhaps one of the most well-known of the Illuminati family. They accumulated so much power and were so open about their activities that it was inevitable that they would come to public attention. Nathan Rothschild is famous for financing both sides of a war, and indirectly letting Britain win because he decided it would be more profitable for his family if that was to happen. He spread a rumor that Napoleon was winning the war and sold all his bonds. When all the other traders copied him, he bought them back at a fraction of the price. In one fell swoop he transferred the wealth from the richest people in England to him. In his own words, it was one of the finest pieces of business he ever did. The word shrewd is an understatement. The Rothschilds are masters of finance and have investments everywhere. They have recently gone underground to a degree, but have increased investments in food and natural resources.\nThe Rockefellers\nThis is an Illuminati bloodline that is on the decline with the death of the figurehead, David Rockefeller, who died recently at the age of 101. The Rockefellers originally made their fortunes through establishing the oil industry in the USA. In the late 19th and 20th Century John D Rockefeller became the world\u2019s richest man through Standard Oil, using less than humanitarian means. The family has long been associated with the bank of JP Morgan, now Chase Manhattan. Their wealth is incredible, and the family is centered in the US, primarily in oil, banking and real estate. They also have many connections in politics and international finance. Their wealth is huge and diversified and it is impossible to really calculate, like the wealth of all such families. John D Rockefellers was the first to set up an investment fund designed to manage the wealth of a single family on 1882.\nFor more than a century, ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as \u2018internationalists\u2019 and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure \u2014 one world, if you will. If that is the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.\nDavid Rockefeller \u2013 Memoirs\nThe DuPont Family\nAnother key family located in America. The DuPont family can trace its lineage back to Paris in the 1700\u2019s. They have huge holdings in real estate and industrial outlets, particularly in Delaware. They have been one of the richest families in America since the 19th Century. Two family members are known for their role in criminal cases. John DuPont murdered Olympic gold medalist Dave Schulz in 1996 and his heir was convicted of raping his 3-year-old daughter in 2009. As of 2016 the family fortune was estimated to be over $15 billion.\nThe Astor Family\nThe name of the Astor family stretches back all the way to the early 1700\u2019s. Again, this family has its roots in the USA, once hailed as being the land of the free, but simultaneously also accredited as being the home of globalism and the New World Order. For many years the Astor\u2019s were known as the landlords of New York due to the amount of real estate they owned in this area. They also came to prominence in the UK during the 19th and 20th Centuries. Originally the roots of the family can be traced back to the Alp in Italy. John Astor was one of the richest people in history, born from a family of flute makers in Germany who settled in England.\nThe Bundy Family\nThe Bundy family are perhaps one of the lesser known families of the 13 bloodlines. The Bundy\u2019s are a modern Illuminati family (rose to prominence in 19th Century) with ties to America and a lot of the Illuminati operations that take place there. This includes the Manhattan Project, matters of private security and CIA operations including mind control. They are also involved in groups such as the Bilderberg group, the Council of Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission. Many Bundy\u2019s went to top American universities and are/all members of the notorious Skull and Bones society associated with every President of the USA. While most would not associate the Bundy\u2019s with an Illuminati elite bloodline, in the modern era two Bundy brothers held key positions that controlled much information fed to U.S. Presidents during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. They prefer to take roles very close to primary positions so they can control the process. If you were to look back through the ranks of political offices you may find that the Bundy\u2019s have all held key role in political positions. THE Three most prominent Bundies include Harvey Hollister Bundy, Sr., William P. Bundy, and McGeorge Bundy. They were extremely influential in shaping American politics but are not as well-known as typical Illuminati members.\nThe Collins Family\nAgain, another secret family of the Illuminati. Precious little is known about the history of this family. It is suspected that this family is actually one of the more powerful families within the \u201ccabal\u201d. This is becoming a popular theory, that the families that are most commonly heard about, such as the Rothschilds, are actually the weaker of the 13 bloodlines. However, power is always sifting back and forth between these families so the lines are not clearly drawn. Every family seeks more and more power in what they view as a giant game with humanity as a mere pawn. No quarter is given to losers, as not winning is a sign of natural selection that the loser is predestined to shortly join the extinct. The Collins family is rumored to have links with the New England Satanists. Astronaut Michael Collins is a possible member. Joan Collins is another key Illuminati member. It is said that the Rothschilds are the financial power, but that the Collins hold the power of magic. Many of their family members are witches and wield great spiritual power. They have been kept out of the limelight because they have more occult power than the Rothschilds or the Rockefellers.\nThe Freeman Family\nAgain, another family that is not traditionally though to be members of the infamous 13. They are heavily connected with the French fraternal organization known as the Priority of Zion. Two Freeman\u2019s have been key advisors to French Presidents. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) is run by the Freemans, ostensibly as an Illuminati front. Whenever any legitimate criticism comes on an Illuminati organization the ADL can declare this to be mere defamation. It was Walter Freeman who introduced the concept of lobotomy into the US. This is regarded as a brutal form of mind control permitted to be done as a benefit to humanity but being anything but. The late Grand Master of the Priory of Zion was Gaylord Freeman.\nThe Li Bloodline\nIt should be noted than family names mean more to Chinese people than to those in the West. Two people in China with the same surname, such as Li, would view themselves as relatives. This is obviously not the case if two people were to meet each other in the West with the name \u2018Smith\u2019 or \u2018Johnson\u2019. The Li family is quite popular in China and has a rich and varied history. But there are 3 very significant Chinese individuals with the surname \u2018Li\u2019. There are around 6000 surnames for over 1 billion Chinese. And 5 big family names in China, Chen, Li, Huang, Zhang, and He. The 3 notable individuals are:\n\u2022 Billionaire, philanthropist and de facto ruler of Hong Kong, Li Ka-shing\n\u2022 Li Peng, the ruler of Red China\n\u2022 Lee Kuan Yew President of Singapore\nLi Ka-Shing is the one to watch out for and the one most definitely a member of the Illuminati, if Illuminator and occult researcher Fritz Springmeier. The Rothschild and the Rockefellers have a good relationship with the Li\u2019s.\nThe Kennedy Family\nThis family is the matter of some debate when it comes to Illuminati membership. This is mainly because of the love many have for President John Francis Kennedy and the belief that he was one of the last true presidents. Many contend that every President since has been no more than a puppet. It does seem as if he went against the status quo and existing power structures and fought for the American people against the existing elites. Nevertheless, the Kennedy empire was built on bootlegging and criminal activity. It is an American political dynasty which stretches back for some generations. The general consensus seems to be that they are members of the Illuminati but have a history of battling against them. In other words, they simply wanted more power for themselves and were unwilling to be puppets. JFK\u2019s father John Patrick Kennedy was a member of the Pilgrim society, ranking him as a 6th level Illuminati initiate. These types of power structures are renowned for having chains of hierarchies and levels so it is impossible to gauge who really rules. The controlling hands and the all-seeing eye are now known to the public, no matter how many declare that the truth is coming out.\nThe Onassis Family\nThe Onassis family was a key Illuminati family; however, their power had waned considerably in the last number of years. The key player in the Onassis family was Aristotle Onassis, who died in 1975. Aristotle made his fortune through the purchase of oil tankers in the 1950\u2019s. Aristotle financed and assisted Hitler during the war effort along with Rockefeller and the Kennedys. Huge profits were made as a result. Despite this there are still some key players in the Onassis family. Aristotle\u2019s brother in law, Stavros Niarchos, is a powerful Bilderberg elite. Allegedly, the executive committee of the Bilderberg group is equivalent to a 9th level Illuminati initiate. Stavros married the granddaughter of Henry Ford, 38 years his junior, only to divorce her shortly afterwards, making a fortune in the process. He worked closely with David Rockefeller.\nThe Reynolds Family\nThe Reynolds are famous for their role as tobacco merchants, and less well known for their many dealing in drugs of all kinds, which is where they really made their fortune. Some of the family members have written occult books and they are heavily connected to the Knights Templar and to the Freemasons. They are allied with the DuPont\u2019s, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Grace\u2019s and the Grey\u2019s. Definitely one of the more powerful Illuminati bloodlines. They are also closely associated with the Duke and Cullman families. Their major financial interests lie in banking, Aluminum, tobacco and illegal drugs. Because they are so closely interwoven with the Duke\u2019s and the Cullman\u2019s the three are best dealt with together. Important members of these three families include Angier Biddle Duke, Richard S. Reynolds, Jr., and Joseph F. Cullman, all of whom are members of the Pilgrim society.\nThe Van Duyn Family\nThe Van Duynn\u2019s are one of the more mysterious Illuminati families. They have their origins in Holland and it is difficult to trace their history. As a general rule of thumb those who are lesser known wield the most power. Interesting that there is not even a Wikipedia page about the family bloodline, only some individual members. I would say the fact that there is literally no information about this family is a telltale sign of the true power wielders.\nThe Merovingian Family\nLike the Van Duyn\u2019s, practically nothing is available online about this family, except for the fact that they are definitely a ruling Illuminati family. The roots of the family can be traced back for centuries but as for the activity of specific family members in the modern era little is known.\nOther notable families that are also sometimes claimed to be of the ranks of Illuminati are the Russel\u2019s, the Disney\u2019s, Krupp\u2019s and McDonalds. In addition to these four families, there are hundreds of others who are considered less pure by the main 13 members. They wield less influence and may have married with a few \u2018pure\u2019 members. Some contend that the list is always changing given that the dark Illuminati at the higher levels can shape shift and reincarnate consciously. Thus, a century ago the families were different, including perhaps the Borgias, the De Medici\u2019s and the Spears.\nIt is interesting to look at popular science fiction and fantasy movies and see the many references to these ruling elites. In Harry Potter, there are the Pure Bloods of Voldemort who intermarry and these 13 families do not permit any interference. In Lord of the Rings there is reference to the great eye of Sauron and in Underworld there is much interesting talk of family dynasties who look at humans as a resource to be managed. As the battle between the royal families\u2019 wages on there is little thought given to the welfare of the humans.\nThe Bilderberg Group\nThe Bilderberg group is a group of powerful elites who meet once a year to discuss world affairs. This group is accused of being the shadow government of the world and at their annual meeting discuss. Officially it is a closed door meeting where leader in industry and academia can discuss world affairs. Centenarian David Rockefeller, an adviser to the group, is said to have a large influence on the agenda and who gets invited. In 2014 at the annual meeting the closing statements mentioned the issue of overpopulation on the planet and how to curb the number of individuals. This led many theorists to lump the Bilderberg group in with the Illuminati and that the the main theme of the Bilderberg annual meetings is global depopulation. The chairman also allegedly talked about reducing the mass population to \u201cclassical slave wages\u201d and reducing the population under the guise of trans humanism. While these sort of claims can be viewed with skepticism, surely an organization where presidents, billionaires, prime ministers, established families and aristocracy sit side by side to discuss world affairs represents, at the very least, a conflict of interest.\nIlluminati Symbols and Gestures\nConspiracy proponents are claiming that Illuminati symbols are constantly in plain sight. It is alleged that by putting the symbols in plain sight individuals are giving subconscious consent to be ruled by their overlords. The Illuminati are reported to have a well-known hand gesture for their identification. The same hand gesture is seen by celebrities and politicians and is what identifies these individuals as members of the infamous group. One question is whether or not such celebrities and politicians actually know that they are members of these groups. Some claim that they are hypnotized and are simply not aware of what they are doing. Tales of the Illuminati often go hand in hand with those of mind control, the occult and hypnotism.\nThe great Eye\n\nThe All seeing eye on the pyramid or the \u201cEye of Providence\u201d is the most commonly seen Illuminati symbol, and is even included on American Dollar Bills, along with the word \u201cA New Order for the Ages\u201d (Novos Ordo Seclorum , in Latin). The eye is thought to represent the eye of Lucifer or the eye of Horus and it\u2019s floating over an unfinished pyramid, as the Illuminati\u2019s work is never quite complete. Roman numerals MDCCLXXVI (1776) appear at the base, the year the Illuminati was founded. The great eye is also mentioned in Lord of the Rings. The official and logical explanation is that the declaration of Independence was founded in 1776, the all seeing eye represents God\u2019s omni-present in the universe and the pyramid is unfinished because America is always working for perfection.\nInverted Pyramid\n\nThe inverted pyramid is another common symbol used often by heavy metal bands and is undoubtedly one of the most prolific symbols of satanism. By inverting a symbol the opposite meaning is attached, and the pentagram is deemed a symbol of white magic, often associated with Christianity, the five senses or the five wounds of the Christ. With the single point upward it depicts the mastery of the Spirit over the 4 elements of matter. When inverted it represents the power of the body over the soul or spiritual body, often used by followers of the Left Hand Path, Satanists and black magicians, and often associated with Free Masonry.Conspiracy proponents often cite the fact that the U.S Medal of valour is an inverted pyramid.\nAOK\n\nThe \u201cA-ok\u201d hand sign is touted by conspiracy theorists as a standard Illuminati sign, known as the 666 sign. Yes, this is the sign used by divers to communicate that everything is running smoothly. The rationale given by the occultists is that the three fingers are representative of the unholy trinity \u2013 the horned god, goddess and antichrist. The circle is symbolic of the sun deity and the Illuminati\u2019s never ending search for more light. Another alleged hand sign is the sign of the horns, used often by presidents, heavy metal bands and celebrities, with the index and little finger pointing out and the middle and ring finger curled inwards. This is supposed to represent the horns of Satan and is apparently a salute to Satan himself. If this holds ground it would appear we are all part of the Illuminati \u2013 Who hasn\u2019t used the a-ok sign?\nEl Diablo\n\nOne prominent Illuminati hand gesture is known as El Diablo. A lot of the information with regard to Illuminati symbolism can be attributed to researcher Texe Marrs. According to some, such as Fritz Springmeier, the sign of el Diablo/Sign of the Horns is a type of hypnotic induction which may trigger certain forms of programming. However, this sign has a variety of meanings and has been used in many cultures. This sign is formed by holding the index and little finger up while holding the middle and ring finger down. It is frequently seen in rock and roll and this thus it is also claimed that these musicians are consciously or subconsciously part of the Illuminati or that their music is satanic. The flip side of this is that is was also frequently seen in India usef by none other than Gautama Buddha as Karana Mudra. It helped with the expulsion of demons. So, using another perspective you could actually claim that all the people using these are actually light workers who are working against the Illuminati. It all depends on what you believe or chose to believe. The sign is also used in Italy and other Mediterranean cultures to ward off bad luck when an unfortunate event occurred. It was actually used in Italy to ward off another alleged Illuminati symbol, the evil all seeing eye of Horus.\nHand on Heart\n\nApparently having the hand over the heart is another sign of Illuminati symbolism. Placing the right hand over the heart and having the left hand facing outwards is a sign that the instigator is a member of the Illuminati. Both the pop and George Bush have been seen using these signals on multiple occasions. And the truth lies within the eyes of the beholder. Conspiracy theorists can claim that this is evidence that the pope and George Bush are both members of the Illuminati. While other can claim that if the pope is doing it, then it is evidence that it is not an Illuminati sign. The hand over the heart is allegedly symbolic of the fact that should a Freemason reveal the secrets of the society of free masons then his or her heart would be ripped out. This vow of sign is called the masonic oath. Picture\nV for Victory\n\nAlso known as the Chevron, Sign of Pan the Horned God, Peace Sign. This hand gesture is formed using the index and middle finger to form a V shape with the other fingers closed. It was originally popularized with Winston Churchill during World War II. According to Texe Marrs\u2019s Codex Magica :\nDone in the typical fashion, this sign literally means intercourse by the devil\u2014to be violated sexually by the horned God. The thumb holding down the fingers creates the \u201cvulva,\u201d while the two largest fingers pointed up are the horns of the God (Satan).\nThis sign can also be taken to mean a symbol of wrath and destruction. In typical satanical fashion, it is allegedly twisted to mean its opposite. It is now the universally acceptable sign for peace. This particular sign has the numerical value of five (3 +2) and is taken to represent the sign for the satanic sign of fives.\nMasonic Cry of Distress, Hailing Sign of Distress\n\nThe sign can be formed by raising both hands in the air with palms facing outwards. Should a Freemason ever find him or herself in a court of law and wish to appeal to a fellow Freemason (who the judge invariably is) all they need do is make this gesture. The judge will then simply rule in the favor of the Freemason. Remember, the Freemason is oath bound to help other Freemasons get off the hook by all means possible.\nOther Illuminati Conspiracy Theories\nThere are numerous other Illuminati Conspiracy theories which I won\u2019t waste too much time on, given their unsubstantiated and unlikely nature. There is the Illuminati Cloning Conspiracy, where the Illuminati regularly clone celebrities, and that the Queen of England is herself a clone. This particular conspiracy came from a man called Donald Marshall, who claims to have been a clone himself and to have seen the cloning center. A more popular theory believed by an astoundingly large group of people is that of an Extra-Terrestrial Reptile Alien race governing man kind by taking human form or by bribing/threatening individuals in positions of power. This theory originated with an Englishman called David Icke, who has for some reason made numerous books and documentaries on the issue. He also claimed to be Jesus Christ on live television. Another Illuminati Conspiracy claims that the headquarters of Satan are located in the Vatican where evil rituals take place under neath the very ground where a catholic mass is undertaken. Every sort of criminal and satanic activity that can be thought of has been lain at the feet of the Illuminati \u2013 from organ harvesting, satanic rituals involving blood sacrifice, pedophilia, sex trafficking, Area 51 torture, murders, bribery and mind control.\nThe Freemasons and The Illuminati\n\nJust who, and what are, the Freemasons? Freemasonry has long been linked with the notorious Illuminati. However, it can easily be said that the real truth has been dead and buried or at the very least twisted. And it could also quite easily be said that that the truth of the matter is far more complex than simply labeling either group as good or bad or pure or evil. It could well be that both the Illuminati and the Freemasons started out as inherently pure groups which were later corrupted by dark forces. There are definitely people who believe that the Freemason society is simply a group which consists of good people who recognize and protect sacred knowledge for the good of all. They are quite open about their comings and goings, openly posting on internet forums and having public meetings and lodges. It may be true that the group is corrupt at the top but the individuals at the bottom are trying to better themselves and to work for their fellow man. We will never know unless we actually join the order as everything is mere speculation. There are so many hierarchies and layers of secrecy that the truth of freemasonry is murky at best, and probably a mix of both good and evil. It is most likely that the vast majority of Freemasons are ignorant of the true purpose as there are so many degrees from the bottom of the pyramid to the top. Judging from the activity of Freemasons on the internet, is does seem by and large that the group consists of a group of brothers helping one another out through the mutual recognition of hand gestures. And by using good people to do good works at the bottom it keeps the real actions of the leaders shrouded in mystery. Such as it always was, the majority know not what they do while there is a ruling elite of 1% and 1% of enlightened beings who truly know what is going on.\nIn relation to the Illuminati, the name literally means illumined/enlightened ones. So, it could well be that the name of light/illumined ones has been poisoned by dark forces so that most now actually believe that being part of an enlightened group is something to be avoided! It could also be that the group was initially full of enlightened beings who wanted to protect sacred knowledge and bring light to the world was later corrupted. This is the actual stated aim of the group of Bavarian Illuminati setup in 1776 by Adam Weischaupt. It could well have been quickly infiltrated when the powers that be found out about their intentions. Societies of Illumination and societies of darkness both have to go underground in many places as the battle between the two wages while broader society remains in darkness.\nHow to Join the Illuminati\n\n\u00a0\nIt must be understood that there is no real way to \u201cjoin\u201d the Illuminati. There is a hierarchy of individuals in a certain order who can work for the Illuminati. At best, you can be a pawn of said Illuminati on the premise that they do in fact exist. You can join the ranks of the Freemasons if you have a friend who is contained within their groups. You can lookout for some of the typical hand gestures outline above. If you see someone doing this sign often, then inquire subtly. You will then be taken to an initiation of sorts. You will have to swear the masonic oath. But after this expect to have years of service and not to really get anywhere. There may be certain things you can do to \u201cAdvance\u201d, but it is most definitely not a clear-cut process. Asking how to join the Illuminati is like asking how to join the Denver Broncos or the Barcelona soccer team. Have lots of skill, talent and possibly lots of financial backing and you are on the right track, yet it is still not a guarantee. You might think you are part of the Illuminati, yet you will still only be their servant like a lot of the politicians and celebrities. You will be a Freemason, yet not a core group of the ruling elites.\nThose who are members of the Illuminati all go to prestigious schools and all undergo some form of initiation. In the US, this is done through the Skull and Bones Society in the best universities(Skull and Bones is at Yale but there are equivalent societies and initiation groups in other universities). All Presidents were instated this way. The whole idea behind the Illuminati is that the people are previously selected to occupy certain roles within society based on their purity(bloodline, coming from the right interbred family). All of the important people will have the finances and go to the best schools where they will be initiated and take the pledge of the Brotherhood. Presidents take this pledge which means they swear allegiance to the Illuminati before they swear allegiance to the United States of America. So there is no way to join they, as it is all panned in advance.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, it seems that Illuminati started out as an enlightenment group in 1776, was rapidly shut down and now has been used by conspiracy theorists ever since. Any group of elites who meet in secret seem to be deemed \u201cIlluminati\u201d. Any group alleged to have a depopulation or mass subjugation agenda are also deemed to be Illuminati, as is anyone who uses certain usually innocuous hand signs.\nThe recent news and activity with regard to the Illuminati has died down. This is due to the intangible nature of the Illuminati themselves. It can be said that even conspiracy theorists have gotten sick of the concept. It is too vague and the term is now more or less meaningless. The Illuminati are connected with the killing of practically every high-profile individual in some way or another. The Illuminati are \u201cOld News\u201d in comparison to the New World Order, the Deep State and the Shadow Government.\nThere may be some merit to the New World Order as there does appear to be a globalist agenda involving consolidated power at the top with a merging of countries. Aliens, Reptiles, and subconscious symbolism are by their nature impossible to verify. If the Illuminati exist they are far smarter and more ordered than the general populace and we are no closer to the truth of the matter despite lots of work from various individuals. To add to the mystery, there are many spiritual masters who declare themselves to be illumined or enlightened. This could well be the original meaning of the word. And thus, there are more than likely secret societies whose job it is to guard sacred knowledge but are entirely benevolent, as well as secret societies which are entirely malevolent. But there is no way of knowing without actually being in these orders.\nIlluminati Documentaries\nIlluminati Secrets \u2013 The New Atlantis\n\nSecret Societies: Illuminati and Freemasonry\n\nIlluminati: The All Seeing Eye",

    "title": "Iraq War/WMD",
    "content": "The 2003 Invasion of Iraq lasted from March to May 2003. Forces from the UK, Poland, the U.S and Australia invaded Iraq to dispose Saddam Hussein. 160,000 troops were sent in total from the coalition, with the majority being from the U.S with supplementary forces from the other countries. The principle reason given for the invasion of Iraq was that it had in it\u2019s possession Weapons of Mass Destruction (\u201cWMD\u2019s\u201d). UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S.A. President George W Bush both endorsed the war due to the perceived threat of the WMDs. Upon the election of George W Bush in 2000 foreign policy towards Iraq became more aggressive. The aggression only heightened after the 9/11 attacks, however the rationale to invade Iraq as a response to the September 11 attacks has been widely criticized. There has been no evidence of collaboration between Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda. Shortly after Sept 11 Bush announced his \u201cWar on Terror\u201d regime which consisted of a hostile foreign policy and increased powers of police and the military, extended checks in airports and more government power to investigate private data if the citizen fell under the definition of terrorist.\nA Memo written by Donald Rumsfield in 2001 contemplates an Iraq war. The Bush administration waited until Septemeber 2002 to announce action against Iraq would take place, with White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card saying,\n \u201cFrom a marketing point of view, you don\u2019t introduce new products in August.\u201d\nAnother reason given for the invasion was to free the Iraqi people from the terrorism of Saddam Hussein, however this would not have been enough to secure the support of the public with regard to an invasion. According to U.S polls over 60% of the public were against the war. France, Germany and New Zealand were strongly against the invasion as they argued there was no evidence of weapons of mass destruction from their intelligence sources. There was also a rally of Three Million people in Rome against the war, the biggest rally ever recorded. The invasion started with an airstrike in Baghdad on the 20th March 2003 and ended on 1st May, where the military occupation period began.\nSaddam Hussein & Iraq war justified from Britain\nWeapons of Mass Destruction aside, it could be argued that the dictatorial regime of Saddam Hussein was enough to justify an Iraq invasion. A document drafted by the British Government with a foreword from Prime Minister Tony Blair outlined aspects of the Regime as well as the evidence behind WMD\u2019s in Iraq. The report makes for chilling reading:\n\u201cSaddam\u2019s son Udayy maintained a private torture chamber known as the Red Room in a building on the banks of the Tigris disguised as an electricity installation. He created a militia in 1994 which has used swords to execute victims outside their own homes. He has personally executed dissidents, for instance in the Shia uprising at Basra which followed the Gulf War.\u201d\n\u201cMembers of Saddam\u2019s family are also subject to persecution. A cousin of Saddam, Ala Abd al-Qadir al-Majid, fled to Jordan from Iraq citing disagreements with the regime over business matters. He returned to Iraq after the Iraqi Ambassador in Jordan declared publicly that his life was not in danger. He was met at the border by Tahir Habbush, Head of the Directorate of General Intelligence (the Mukhabarat), and taken to a farm owned by Ali Hasan al-Majid.At the farm Ala was tied to a tree and executed by members of his immediate family who, following orders from Saddam, took it in turns to shoot him\u201d\n\u201cSome 40 of Saddam\u2019s relatives, including women and children, have been killed. His sons-in-law Hussein and Saddam Kamil had defected in 1995 and returned to Iraq from Jordan after the Iraqi government had announced amnesties for them. They were executed in February 1996\u201d\nSaddam Hussain\nThe document also explains how difficult it was to get information in Iraq at the time, how Saddam\u2019s regime is one of the most secretive and tightly kept in the world and how it would be impossible for the intelligence agencies to publish their sources. Blair praised the intelligence agencies and said he was satisfied that what they had given him was enough for the purposes of an invasion. Despite sanctions he says that Saddam had no intention of stopping the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction. He outlines that Saddam had been using chemical weapons not only against foreign countries but upon his own people. And on the data of his intelligence agencies these weapons were ready for mobilization within 45 minutes notice. And he finishes that with the information in front of him the UK government is correct to take action to ensure that Saddam Hussein does not use the weapons he has or obtain the devices he desires. The document then outlines intelligence from a variety of sources, including an independent review from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) who noted that Iraq could construct nuclear devices within months of obtaining fission material as well as information already in the public domain from UN reports and Iraqi defectors. The primary British Intelligence agencies are the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the Security Service, and the Defense Intelligence Staff (DIS). The Joint Intelligence Committee reviews all intelligence and presents reports to parliament and government along with recommendations. This official document would seem to indicate that there was significant evidence of weapons of mass destruction as well as a brutal regime in place by dictator Saddam Hussein which more than justified an invasion from a British point of view. However there was no concrete, substantial, tangible evidence of WMD, just likelihoods and probabilities.\nTony Blair\nTony Blair has since been criticized by UN weapons inspector Dr Hans Blix for misrepresenting intelligence on WMD as a justification for the Iraqi war. Claims about Iraqi WMD\u2019s were allegedly not an accurate representation at the time. The information supplied by the intelligence agencies was described as sporadic and patchy at best; however, it was sold to the public that Iraq almost definitely had WMD\u2019s at its disposal with more being actively developed under Saddam. The inspector criticized Blair that just because weapons were unaccounted for does not mean that they exist, and said that Blair jumped to conclusions.\nIt is arguable that Blair did exaggerate the chances of WMD being held by Saddam, but that it was still the right decision. Saddam had a brutal regime and used chemical warfare on his own citizens. It was better to assume the worst, invade and see for certain than assume that he did not. And if the decision was made to go in and ensure there were no WMD then it is obviously better to sell the war as much as possible. A war cannot be entered on the premise that Iraq possibly has WMD but has to be entered firmly on the idea that Iraq most definitely has WMD.\nBetrayal by the Intelligence Agencies\nFile photo dated 19/11/03 of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair (right) alongside former US President George Bush.\nSome contend that it was the Intelligence agencies themselves who sold out the politicians, George Bush and Tony Blair. This would represent the Intelligence agencies themselves as stronger players in international politics than previously imagined or even historically seen. Theorists contend that the intelligence given to the politicians inaccurately described the probability of WMD\u2019s being held by Saddam. It is contended that most Intelligence agencies, such as those in Russia, Germany and France, were aware that there was no evidence of WMD\u2019s in Iraq. But the Intelligence agencies in the US and the UK lied about the chances of WMD\u2019s in the hands of Saddam Hussein. More likely than this is that the politicians and the Intelligence Agencies collaborated to a degree so that all evidence that was relied on in the reports would justify an invasion by focusing on unreliable sources that backed up theories of WMD\u2019s in Iraq. The politicians could say they were relying on official intelligence, which they were. The agencies could say they were merely relying on their sources, which could obviously not be disclosed as mentioned in the previous document with Tony Blair.\nIt is also alleged that the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in the US concluded that the idea that Saddam possessed WMDs was built on air. There was no evidence any Iraqi facilities produced, tested or stored biological weapons. No mobile production plants could be found. They found nothing showing Iraq had the processes to produce chemical devices. The analysts even doubted Saddam had long-range missiles. However the report produced by the DIA was never shown to President Bush, but was instead shown a much weaker National Intelligence Estimate from the CIA. Bush and Rice were not fully informed, with Cheney and Rumsfield collaborating with the Intelligence agencies and spewing Iraqi propaganda. In 2002 Saddam allowed US weapons inspectors to return to look at WMD\u2019s that did not exist, and were told by Cheney that if they failed to find them, the inspectors would be discredited. When none of the sites identified by the CIA contained any WMD\u2019s the team was told to find them where they could, not question intelligence agencies. Members of the Bush administration wanted to push and Iraq war and got what they wanted.\nChanging Narrative \u2013 WMD found?\nThere can be no question that the phrasing used to justify a war in Iraq can amount to no more than a lie on part of the establishment. Vice President Dick Cheney:\n\u201cThere is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction\u2026.There is no doubt he is amassing them to use against our friends, against our allies and against us.\u201d\nSuch statements amount to no more than mere propaganda, as there was no concrete evidence at the time, just conjecture from the intelligence agencies. And it was shown as such when no weapons were actually found. That said it has been recently contended that WMD\u2019s have in fact been found. The New York Times published many articles about how the chemical munitions found by the U.S amount to a violation of U.N protocols and can be said to constitute weapons of mass destruction. Between 2004 and 2011 U.S troops found more than 5000 Iraqi chemical munitions. Rush Limbaugh has stated that this is irrevocable proof that the war on Iraq was justified. However this claim is false. These munitions were never concealed by Saddam, and amount to leftovers from it\u2019s war with Iran. Most of the chemical munitions were destroyed when inspectors from the U.S came in from 1992-1994. And the rest could not be accounted for, bearing in mind the Iraqi\u2019s had a total of 101,000 chemical munitions accounted for in the war with Iran. And to put it in perspective the U.S military itself lost $1.2 billion worth of equipment in it\u2019s first year of the Iraqi war and maintenance, as per the Federal Government\u2019s General Accounting Office. However most respected and mainstream outfits do recognize that the finding of these chemical munitions do no justify the Iraqi war. Also, Bush accused Iraq of concealing \u201c30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents\u201d from before the Gulf War. Colin Powell spoke of those munitions in his U.N. address, as well as \u201c550 artillery shells with mustard\u201d and \u201cenough precursors to increase his stockpile to as much as 500 tons of chemical agents\u201d. These are accusations of with regard to munitions pre 1991, and both claims have turned out to be false.\nConclusion: Was there WMD\u2019s found in Iraq?\nThe moment of the falling of Saddam\u2019s statue, with the help of the US Army.\nSome WMD\u2019s were found but they were not hidden, and they were all from the war from Iran. No facilities or weapons of mass destruction have been found which indicate that Saddam was actively producing them. In other words the rationale for the invasion of Iraq was complete unjustified on the grounds of WMD\u2019s and the idea that Bin Laden/Al-Qaeda was collaborating with Saddam Hussein, Bin Laden having actively rebelled against Hussein. The invasion may have been justified on the grounds of humanitarian policy, as Hussein was a brutal dictator who needed to be removed.\nThe politicians most definitely exaggerated their claims in order to garnish support for the war. They could not justify an invasion on weak evidence of possible WMD\u2019s in Iraq. The invasion of Iraq was by and large unjustified as no WMD\u2019s were found of the type that would justify the invasion. Whether or not it was a failure of the intelligence agencies, or an orchestrated invasion on behalf of corruption politicians and the oil industry we will never know for sure.\nYou may also want to check Peak Oil Conspiracy..\nDocumentaries and Related Videos\nBelow we discover the documentaries and related videos surrounding Saddam Hussain, Iraq war and Weapons of mass destruction (WMD).

    "title": "JFK Assassination",
    "content": "On November 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. It is commonly believed that he was killed by a lone shooter, Lee Harvey Oswald, who shot at the president\u2019s car multiple times from one of the top floors of an old book depository in Dallas, TX. It is believed that Kennedy was dead before the car stopped and that Lee Harvey Oswald acted completely alone. Not long after the assassination Oswald was assassinated as well, by a nightclub owner with mafia ties Jack Ruby. The events of the Kennedy assassination have led to a variety of conspiracy theories about the events.\nThere are numerous JFK conspiracies, but there are four that seem to be the most popular. These theories put the blame on the government, the mafia, Lyndon B. Johnson, and the grassy knoll shooter. While we don\u2019t have all the details on JFK conspiracy facts, many of these theories have a legion of believers.\u00a0 It is estimated that only approximately 60% of the United States people believe the \u201cOswald JFK theory\u201d.\nHere are some of the most common JFK conspiracies\u00a0\nDid the Government Kill JFK?\nMany believe that John F. Kennedy was assassinated by a government group. One element within the government that may have benefited from the death of the president were those that benefited from the military industrial complex. The president preceding, Dwight D. Eisenhower, had warned the American people about the military industrial complex. There are those that believe that Kennedy had taken Eisenhower\u2019s advice seriously and was planning to reduce the size of the military.\nThese theorists believe that Kennedy was planning to end all United States involvement in Vietnam and that he was planning on negotiating a long term peace with the Soviet Union. This would have ended the Cold War extremely early. Many believe that the potential reduction in the size of the military serves as a motive for elements in the Pentagon and military contractors to want to make an attempt on Kennedy\u2019s life. While there is not a lot of physical evidence to go along with this particular conspiracy there is definitely a lot of space for a motive, mainly millions of dollars lost by the companies involved.\nDid the Mafia kill JFK?\nJack Ruby shooting Lee Harvey Oswald\nThere are also many people believe that the Mafia may have been involved in the death of John F. Kennedy. Many believe that the mafia had worked with Joe Kennedy to help get JFK elected. After getting elected Kennedy failed to protect United States interests in Cuba, which lost the mafia a lot of money. The Kennedy administration had also begun to crack down on organized crime. There is some JFK assassination conspiracy evidence that suggests that the mafia worked with the CIA to make an attempt on the president\u2019s life. The Mafia link continues to intrigue JFK conspiracy theory buffs.\nOne thing that also points towards the mafia involvement in the JFK shooting was their ties to Jack Ruby. Ruby was the man who gunned down alleged Kennedy shooter Lee Harvey Oswald as he was being transported by police after his capture.\u00a0 Ruby, a Dallas nightclub owner, was believed to have ties to organized crime and is a big part of the Mafia/Kennedy theory.\nDid LBJ have Kennedy killed?\nThere are many that believe that Lyndon B. Johnson, the Vice President, may have been involved in Kennedy\u2019s death. Lyndon Johnson had a lot to gain from the death of the president. After Kennedy died Lyndon Johnson rushed through his getting sworn in. He supposedly did this to make sure that the country knew it had a president. Many however believe that the Vice President acted too rashly as if he knew the event was going to happen. No actual evidence has been uncovered to implicate Lyndon B. Johnson, but he remains a popular target of conspiracy theories.\nThe Grassy Knoll\nOne conspiracy theory that no one has had an answer to has been the shooter on the grassy knoll. The number of shots has been put up for debate several times.\n\nWe have physical evidence of three different shots, but several witnesses have claimed that they heard a fourth shot coming from the direction of the grassy knoll. We also have JFK assassination conspiracy evidence that there was a suspicious person on the grassy knoll, known as the \u201cJFK umbrella man\u201d. This combination of evidence has led many to the belief that a second shooter was present on that day. Others have concluded that the second shooter fired the fourth shot that killed the president. If this evidence turned out to be true, then it would mean that someone killed the president and got away with it. Throughout the years the grassy knoll theory remains one of the most popular John F Kennedy conspiracy theories.\nJFK\u00a0Assassination Video Footage \u2013 Slow Motion\n\nThere are not one but multiple documentaries. So we have decided to create separate post for it. Please see our post on JFK Assassination Conspiracy Documentary Videos.\nWhile what is taught in history classes in the United States is that Lee Harvey Oswald was the only person responsible for the death of John F. Kennedy. Theorists will argue that Oswald was just a scapegoat for many of the above theories. Everything that Oswald knew never had a chance to get out as he himself was gunned down shortly after being taken into custody. This is why we may never truly know who shot John F Kennedy.",

    "title": "Manhattan Project",
    "content": "Robert Oppenheimer\nThe origins of the Manhattan Project started in 1939 when American intelligence became aware of the dangers of nuclear weapons in the hands of the Nazis. Such a weapon could pose a huge threat to the U.S and would leave them at Hitler\u2019s mercy if he won the war. He would doubtless have turned his attention Westwards if Europe was under his subjugation, as well as East towards the Russians.\nThe Manhattan Project is not in any way a conspiracy theory. It is officially documented and the documents are available online. In response to the threat of nuclear weapons, the U.S had to commission their own project. Such has always been the policy of the United States, to have the largest guns which act as a deterrent, and it is a policy which has traditionally been very successful.\nScope of the Manhattan Project\nThe Manhattan Project is the biggest true conspiracy theory to date. It was reported after it\u2019s imitation but can only be deemed officially \u201ctrue\u201d after the declassification and publication of official reports. It would employ more than 130,000 people and spawn many industrial and research industries and spin off industries. Entire towns were constructed in secret government supervision. The research took place in Canada, the U.K and the U.S.A. The primary research sites for the project were the Hanford Site, the Los Alamos National Laboratory and Oak Ridge, Tennessee. It is the sheer scope of the project that leads most to deny the existence of the Manhattan Project, not just the unlikelihood of the plot itself. The idea that a project this big has been kept a secret largely discredits the idea.\nInformation leaks\nSome say that many, many people did speak out about the Manhattan project. The very fact that it is being discussed right now indicates that it was not kept secret at all. And the Department of Energy has actually posted all accounts online with the official document history of the Manhattan Project. The last section in the document referring to intelligence and security states that:\n\u201cSince September 1943, investigations were conducted of more than 1,500 \u2018loose talk\u2019 or leakage of information cases and corrective action was taken in more than 1,200 violations of procedures for handling classified material\u2026.\u201d\nAnd people who contend that there is no way that the Manhattan Project would be kept a secret do not understand how projects of this nature actually work. Every individual is no more than a cog in a machine, developing a tiny part of a much bigger piece. Ten people could have a job and report to a supervisor, and 10 supervisors would report to their supervising officer, and so on. Thus the overall picture would only be seen by those at the top echelons. This is also how it works in warfare to a degree, with the regular officers being told to fire or engage, and the overall strategy generally only seen by those at the top. The people at the bottom simply follow orders. The front page of the New York times in 1945 reads:\u201dAtom Bombs Made in 3 Hidden \u2018Cities\u2019: Secrecy on Weapon So Great That Not Even Workers Knew of Their Product\u201d It further states:\n\u201cOne of these, Oak Ridge, situated where only oak and pine trees had dotted small farms before, is now the 5th largest city in Tennessee. Its population of 70,000 has 13 supermarkets, 9 drug stores, and 7 theatres.\nA second town of 7,000 was built for reasons and security on a New Mexico mesa. The third, named Rockland Village, houses 17,000 men, women, and children on the remote banks of the Columbia River in the State of Washington.\nNone of the people, who came to these developments from homes all the way from Maine to California, had the slightest idea of what they were making in the gigantic government plants\u201d\nThere are numerous reports of leaks, 1500 in total according to official government papers. One of these leaks includes a naval lieutenant, who observed the top secret project and simply speculated to many individuals that it must be for the creation of an atomic bomb. He was interviewed by journalists and outlined his thoughts. An employee for an engineering firm in New York was engaged in contracting work for the government. After losing top secret papers with regard to the project he ended up losing his job. Other cases of such leaks include sermons given by ministers and information pamphlets, all which outlines the dangers of Uranium 235 and the capacities of the resulting nuclear weapons.\nThe Manhattan Project Conspiracy Theories\nCzar Nicolas II\nFor every one true conspiracy, there are numerous fake theories or offshoots. Some theorists contend that there is a different Manhattan Project, relating to an underground bunker in Central Park, New York (aka central park conspiracy theory). Central Park was paid for by the federal government to house the first underground governmental facility. This facility was used to house a number of famous people over the years. Czar Nicolas II has held to have lived and died in the underground facility. After the Bolshevik revolution of 1917, the Czar asked President Wilson for assistance. The Czar and his family were the first to live in this underground facility. U.S Marines flew in and rescued the Czar and his family, who dressed as Jewish immigrants and lived a happy life in the U.S until their death.\nAdolf Hitler is also claimed to have lived there after his escape from the U.S. Before the end of the war Hitler contacted President Roosevelt. He would give Roosevelt the atomic bomb the Nazis had been developing and all scientific research and the hiding places of all his top scientists, if he gained political asylum in the U.S. He lived in the Manhattan Project until his peaceful death in 1956. The body found is the bunker by the Soviets in Berlin was that of his double, Gustav Weler.\nIt is also claimed that aliens found in Roswell, New Mexico, were nursed back to health and lived in the Manhattan Project. They lived happily in their home under Central Park until their death in 1968 and 1969. In return for the assistance, they gave many technologies to the United States, including Teflon, stealth plane technology and radar. Why they had this technology but did not have the capability to travel back to where they came is not clear. Evidence of these theories is allegedly available on the FBI website. Other claims in relation to the Manhattan Project are that it has up to 60 miles of underground roads, contains an underground lake and it is where all the gold of the United States is kept. It is also expanding and growing every since it\u2019s creation in the 1860\u2019s. It is now apparently a city underneath a city.\nConclusion\n\nThere is no doubt that there was an official, documented project to develop an atomic bomb by the U.S, and its existence was kept a secret, but without much success. This is simple, reasonable, natural and logical. There was a threat, the U.S needed to create a deterrent, and it had to be kept a secret, for a good reason. It would be naive to imagine otherwise. The atomic bomb was used in Hiroshima, in response to an attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese. The side conspiracies of a Manhattan Project in Manhattan with an underground bunker is absurd. Why would Marines fly to Russia to protect the Czar? And why would Hitler ask Roosevelt for asylum if he got free of Berlin in the first place, instead of simply moving to Brazil or somewhere remote? There is no basis for these theories, and they can be lumped in the same category of alien reptiles and UFOs.\nDocumentaries and Related Videos\nThe Moment in Time: The Manhattan Project\n\nWorld\u2019s First Atomic Bomb \u2013 Manhattan Project\n\nThe Day After Trinity\nThis documentary is about Robert Oppenheimer and his life\u00a0before and after the Hiroshima bombings.",

    "title": "Mars: Is There Life on Mars?",
    "content": "\nThe length of a day on Mars is similar to a day on Earthquake\nThe tilting of its axis is similar to Earth\u2019s, meaning it experiences seasons in the same way Earth does.\nMars has Polar Ice caps.\n\nA recent find by NASA on 22nd December 2016 found a large amount of underground ice, as well as long streaks of damp soil, which means there is water on the planet which was once thought dry and uninhabitable. This is significant in that it means that Mars is capable of being the home to micro-organisms, and therefore life in general. This is not to suggest that there is life on Mars, just that it is now possible that there could be. Scientists also found proof of a complex form of organics, the type which contain carbon, the building block of life, in 2014. More evidence that life on Mars is possible.\nIs there Life on Mars?\nAstronomer, Percival Lawrence Lowell\nThe idea that there was life on Mars initially started with the observations of astronomer Percival Lowell, who claimed he saw canals on the surface of Mars. This led to the writing of the popular fiction novel War of the World by British author H.G. Wells, along with other works of fiction depicting attacks from Martians. This brought the idea into the public awareness. In the 1960\u2019s and the 1970\u2019s this theory was disproven by satellites orbiting around the atmosphere of Mars. A soil sample brought back by one of these satellites, Viking 1, evidence that there was no life on Mars. This sample has since been disproven. The possibility of finding life on on the interior of Mars is actually quite high, according to the Professor of Planetary Geology at the University of Arizona, Alfred Mcewen.\nReliability\nIt is worth noting that NASA does not know the minimum number of parameters that are needed to sustain life. They do know that some combination of water, chemical environment, energy for metabolism and conductive physical conditions are needed. These are fundamental to all organisms, who consists of water, need a surplus of nutrients, a minority of toxins such as heavy metals, oxidants/reductants for metabolism and appropriate physical conditions such as pressure, PH, temperature etc. It is important to note that science operates on what is currently known. Thus there could be life forms which survive without one or all of the above. In this case all of NASA\u2019s parameters with regard to the existence of life could be thrown off,\nHuman Life on Mars\nWhen NASA sends probes and astronauts to space, there is a large chance that it will actually propagate life on Mars. This is because humans are contaminants, and when they travel to distant planets they carry small amounts of biological organisms. The same follows for spacecraft and satelites. Thus the possibility has arisen that they might find life which were brought by probes decades ago and jump to multiple incorrect conclusions about life on Mars. The original Martian landing probes were heated to over 230 degrees Fahrenheit for up to half an hour. The probes were encased in a ceramic sheath before being \u201cbaked\u201d This process is known as burden reduction. No Astronauts have been sent to Mars as of yet.\nThere is speculation from theorists that life may exist on Mars. Then there are claims by many, many conspiracy theorists that there is and always has been life on Mars.\nThere was Life on Mars\n\nAn Indian probe has caught images of Mars that appeared to show a crater on its surface. This has prompted many to speculate that there was life on Mars at one stage, which was all destroyed due to a nuclear attack. This has been propagated not only by far out theorists but also by physicists and astrobiologists. The nuclear isotopes in the atmosphere of Mars are said to resemble those of hydrogen bombs on Earth.\nLife on Mars: It\u2019s the Left\nRight Wing Talkshow host Rush Limbaugh has indicated that all news of life on Mars stems from a left wing Agenda. He purports that there is no water on Mars and that this has been made up by the Left.\n\u201dWhat\u2019s to stop them from making up something that happened on Mars that will help advance their left-wing agenda on this planet?\u201d Limbaugh state on his show.\nHe has assumed connections between a left wing agenda, climate change and life on Mars. He contends that there may have once been life on Mars and that dubious science was used to promote Climate change on earth. This theory is dubious at best.\nMartian City Published\nOne of the more current Martian theories circulating the internet is that a picture on the NASA website shows a Martian city with an apartment building. The fact that the photo in question was published as a thumbnail and not in high-resolution format prompted many to suggest that it was a cover up. This does not seem rational given that they could have simply not uploaded the picture at all. The primary driving force behind this allegation is UFO hunter Scott Waring.\n\nWaring enhanced the photo and put it on his blog. According to Waring buildings were seen with windows and doors. Contenders have claimed that this is a standard human logical inconsistency to see what they want in pictures and images in unusual contexts to make sense of what they see. After all, there is nothing whatsoever to suggest that Extra-Terrestrial life would inhabit buildings with doors and windows.\nMars is an Alien Outpost\nCanadian Andre Gignac has claimed that a bunker can be seen in a picture taken by the Mars Rover \u201cOpportunity\u201d. The bunker allegedly contains armed Aliens peering out of it. He claimed the bunker to be a corridor leading to another corridor, and that in close proximity to the bunker are missiles and nuclear arms. He also claimed that multiple bunkers have been found in previous NASA pictures. NASA have refuted these claims by stating that they are caused by shadows or lack of resolution. There are reports online of an anonymous \u201cwhistleblower\u201d going by the pseudonym Captain Kaye who allegedly spent 17 years serving at a military camp on Mars. The base is located within a crater and is known as Ares Prime. The air on Mars is apparently breathable and it is sometimes warm on the surface. According to \u201cCaptain Kaye\u201d there are two highly advanced species on Mars. One is related the conspiracy theory that is absolutely impossible to get away from \u2013 the Reptile race. The Reptiles are reported as being hostile and fiercely defensive of their territory. The other group were indigenous Martians and the relations between them and the humans was reported to be neutral. They were not interested in expanding their territory, only in maintaining it. Kaye describes a battle to recover an artifact in the territory of the Reptiles and reports that only him and 27 others escape. Other \u201cWhistleblowers\u201d include the great-granddaughter of President Eisenhower, Laura Magdalene Eisenhower, who claims that efforts were made to recruit her to join a colony on Mars, as well as Micheal Relfe, alleging that he spent over 20 years on duty on Mars.\nOther Martian speculation\nThere are countless theories with regard to life on Mars. A picture released by NASA appears to contain a picture of a human working on the Mars Range rover with no helmet on. This has led some to suggest that NASA engages in extra-terrestrial officers. There have been many claims of animals and animal fossils on Mars from pictures released by NASA. One picture allegedly shows a rat between two rocks. However scientists have said that the temperature on the surface of Mars if too cold for these types of animals to survive. There is alleged evidence of Egyptian pyramids on the surface of Mars, that there is a rock shaped exactly like Barack Obama\u2019s head, that Mars is, in fact, a nuclear outpost stocked with nuclear arms and Extra-Terrestrial mercenaries, and that NASA photos show a miniature woman watching the space probes as they operate. There are also claims of T-Rex Fossils as well as bones and fossils of Extra-Terrestrials, Alien Lizards and ET coffins found on the planet. Many claim that NASA timed the announcement of the findings of water on Mars to coincide with release of the Movie \u201cThe Martian\u201d which tells the story of an astronaut stranded on Mars who manages to grow life and survive.\nThe only source of evidence of any claims about Mars are from pictures and statements given to the public by NASA. Thus all that is available is only speculation.\nScientific Response to Mars ET claims\n\nThe brain has evolved to be able to distinguish faces and other significant objects in crowds and within the environment in general. This is known as Pareidolia, and it is claimed that humans use this to enrich the imagination and to see things that are simply not there. Another theory contends that humans cannot deal with logical gaps and thus tend to make up things that fit, in order to maintain a stable existential framework. It\u2019s hard for many to admit they do not know or are not sure about anything; thus alternative theories are invented to instigate themselves as a person who knows the way things actually operate, as opposed to dealing with the fact that the typical human knows relatively little about Space, physics or Extra-Terrestrial lifeforms.\nIt is possible that life does exist on Mars, and NASA has made this it\u2019s prime objective. This possibility is slim given the small amount of water available. No life has been found as of yet, and until life is found any claims are fraud or speculation, based on third-hand information gained from photos published by the National American Space Agency.\nDocumentaries\nThere are many documentaries about\u00a0Mars Conspiracies, Life on Mars as well as space documentaries about Mars itself. Below are just some of the documentaries that might be interesting to watch.\nMARS\u00a0The New Life Evidence\n\nIs There Life on Mars?

    "title": "Martin Luther King Jr. Assassination",
    "content": "Martin Luther King junior was a famous civil rights activist renowned for his peaceful methods of protest against white supremacy. He is the most prominent figure in terms of attaining rights for African Americans in the Unites States. He was also a clergy man. He was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee in April 1968. Fugitive James Earl Ray pleaded guilty to the murder with a subsequent sentence of 99 years in Tennessee State penitentiary. MLK was shot on the balcony of his hotel room by James Earl Ray using a sniper rifle. No credible historian of official has denied the official story. Ray died in 1998 and professed his innocence up until his death. However his narrative changed with regard to why he initially confessed. The Martin Luther King Jr. Assassination stirred up much controversy and he is seen as a martyr and an icon for the plight of Africa Americans living in the U.S.A.\nLoyd Jowers\nJames Earl Ray\nLloyd Jowers owned Jim\u2019s grill which operated across the road from Lorraine Motel where King was shot. In 1993 Jowers claimed that he was given over $100,000 to murder MLK. He says he hired a different killer than he was supposed to. Memphis district attorney was unable to find any evidence that Jowers was involved in the murder of MLK after over 6 months of investigation. In 1998 ABC\u2019s Primetime announced Jowers as a fraud, after initially airing his story and making it public in 1993.\nU.S government\nLoyd Jowers\nThe King family, among others, believe that Martin Luther King Junior (MLK) was assassinated at the hands of the U.S government, indicating that James Earl Ray was no more than a scapegoat. This was also alleged by Loyd Jowers. In 1993 Jowers went live on television on ABC\u2019s Primetime and gave details of the conspiracy involving the Mafia and the U.S government to kill MLK. Earl Clark was hired to fire the first shot. This theory was supported in Memphis courts in 1999, however on 2000 the U.S States Department of Justice dismisses the findings of the earlier court case. An interesting aspect of the earlier case was that it was Jowers v the King family, as Jowers was in as part of the plan to kill King. The government itself could not take part as they were not named as defendants. Jowers were essentially confessing to a conspiracy to kill MLK. The jury was swift in its deliberations, indicating that the evidence was strongly in favor of a conspiracy against MLK with involvement of both the government and the mafia. With regard to the initial court case in Memphis, President of the King Center Dexter King stated that:\n\u201cWe can say that because of the evidence and information obtained in Memphis we believe that this case is over. This is a period in the chapter. We constantly hear reports, which trouble me, that this verdict creates more questions than answers. That is totally false. Anyone who sat in on almost four weeks of testimony, with over seventy witnesses, credible witnesses I might add, from several judges to other very credible witnesses, would know that the truth is here.\u201d\n\u201cThe question now is, \u201cWhat will you do with that?\u201d We as a family have done our part. We have carried this mantle for as long as we can carry it. We know what happened. It is on public record. The transcripts will be available; we will make them available on the Web at some point. Any serious researcher who wants to know what happened can find out.\u201d\nThe full transcript from the MLK trial in Memphis is available online. An interesting exchange happens between the presiding judge and a representative of business interests at the start of the case. Mr Pera argues extensively that the jury selection process be open to the media .\nWilliam Prepper also claims that Ray was set up by the U.S government. Prepper was Ray\u2019s last lawyer, and claims that a team of Green Berets accompanied Ray and his accomplice \u201dRaul\u201d. Raul was a mafia hit man, ray the fall guy, and the government pulling all the strings. Prepper outlines his ideas in the book Orders to Kill: The Truth Behind the Murder of Martin Luther King and mentions the involvement of the CIA (there has never been a conspiracy theory where the CIA was not involved), The FBI and the Memphis police. He also claims that the commander of the Green Berets, Billy Edison, was killed to keep the conspiracy a secret. It is contended that Prepper has convinced the King family of his views about the murder. Prepper was found to have forged a military telegram, and also of outright lying about Billy Edison, who was alive and well and furious at the mention of the involvement of the Green Berets in such a conspiracy theory. Despite this his book was still published( in the same year that Ray died in prison) and generated much misinformation surrounding the deal of Martin Luther King Junior. The second son of MLK, Dexter King, believes that President Lyndon Johnson was involved in the death of his father.\nRaul\nRay has claimed that a character named Raul stood him up for the murder. Allegedly Ray never learned Raul\u2019s real name though he had been involved with operations with him before. Raul told Ray to purchase a rifle and then to give it to him. When Ray handed him the rifle he never heard fro him again. In another version of this theory Ray was in the car while Raul committed the murder. A retired FBI employee has claimed that he found a pieces of paper in Ray\u2019s car with the name \u201cRaul\u201d written on it. The agent took the evidence home and kept it for Thirty years before eventually claiming that he had found it. This information is regarded as fabricated by the FBI. In 1994 \u201cRaul\u201d was apparently found. The individual was quickly acquitted of all involvement in the assassination of MLK. However he is still not free from the groundless accusations.\n\u201cThey have turned my life upside down\u2026 When Dexter King said that I had been found, my wife and I were shocked. This will never end for me, I fear\u2026 Doesn\u2019t the truth matter anymore in this country?\u201d\nThe Raul story does not tally with the confession of the fact that Ray\u2019s fingerprints were found on the rifle, or direct evidence from witnesses who saw him flee the crime scene.\nConclusion\n\nThe official story is quite robust and conclusive. Multiple witnesses report seeing Ray fleeing from his hotel room after the shot was fired. His fingerprints were found on the rifle which he had purchased 2 days before the shooting. Following the two month chase in the aftermath of the assassination, Ray had robbed a bank before finally being apprehended in Heathrow Airport. He confessed to the murder, though he recanted his confession Three days later. It is conclusive that Ray committed the murder himself, though it is possible he was working with others or paid off. There being no concrete evidence of this, it is obviously best to accept the most likely scenario instead of assuming it was a conspiracy.\nMLK Documentaries\nThe Assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nConspiracy 5/11 \u2013 Who Killed Martin Luther King Jr.",

    "title": "The death of Max Spiers",
    "content": "On July 2016 Max Spiers died after vomiting up two liters of black fluid. Spiers had been due to give a conference in Poland about UFO\u2019s, Governments cover-ups and black magic, and was well known for his views on the topic. While this alone would have been enough to rouse suspicion. Polish authorities considered it a death of natural causes, causing distress to followers of Spier\u2019s work and of course to his immediate family. This was in spite of the fact that no post-mortem was carried out. Even more sinister was the text message sent to his mother days before his death, saying \u201cIf anything happens to me, investigate\u201d. What is even more bizarre is that the Polish authorities refused to give the paperwork to Max\u2019s mother Vanessa Banes on the basis that she did not obtain his written permission. She was simply given his death cert. Max also has a brother and sister who are trying to get answers about the nature of his death.\nMax Spiers Conspiracy Response\nVanessa claims that Max was staying with a woman in Warsaw he had not known for long and that the woman had arrived home to find him dead on the sofa. She states\n\u201cBut I think Max had been digging in some dark places and I fear that somebody wanted him dead\u201d.\nMax Spiers had made a living out of investigating UFO sightings and government cover-ups but was rumored to be investigated into the lives of well-known political and corporate figures before his demise.\nMax Spiers\u2019 Friend Danuta Anna Sharma\nThe views and writings of Max Spiers can be accessed online at www.MaxSpiers.com. The site was set up for him by his friend Danuta Anna Sharma. Donation efforts are ongoing to continue the investigation. Renowned conspiracy theorist David Icke claims to have given 1000 pounds sterling to Max\u2019s mother Vanessa after Polish authorities refused to continue the investigation. Max\u2019s ex-girlfriend claimed that before his death he had been subjected to a satanic ritual in order to deprogram him and that he was in a coma for two days. He allegedly phoned her and said he was in a house in a remote forest and could not leave, needing to get to a church quickly but could not.\nJournalist Nick Pope responded to Max Spiers conspiracy proponents by tweeting that UK government officials do not go around killing UFO researchers. He had previously investigated the UFO phenomena on behalf of the UK Ministry of Defence.\nThe Views of Max Spiers\nMax, like Icke, was also a believer in the extraterrestrial. He said: \u201cWe are receiving all kinds of help from masters, ETs and extra-dimensional type angelic beings, and learning very quickly to go inward. The more we are able to go in and listen to that still quiet voice within us, the more we will be in tune with the changes that are occurring around us, and ultimately free us from this ultimate form of control\u201d. Thus the views of Max are comparable to those of Icke and other well-known conspiracy theorists. Max believed in the New World Order, a group of Elites attempting to subjugate the masses via debt financing and media Mind Control.\n\nHe also believed in the MK Ultra Conspiracy Theory, that the Nazi\u2019s who were not imprisoned after World War 2 went underground to continue experiments of mind control. Max also claimed to have been a victim of this \u201cFourth Reich\u201d, a term used for this control regime by the Nazi\u2019s, and to have awoken at the age of 31, brainwashed with the mantra \u201cpain is pleasure, pleasure is pain\u201d. Yes, similar to the mantra used in the famous fight club movie. The idea behind this Fourth Reich is that the Germans are still trying to subvert the world, this time in secret. Max believed that up to 2 million American citizens are subjected to the MK Ultra scheme. The rest of the population are subjected to Mind Control via Falsified history, advertising and fake news headlines. Conspiracy theorists seem to be polarized on the issue of who controls the globe. Some say it is an international cabal of Jewish Bankers, and others say World War II Nazis.\nBig Pharma\nMax believed that Big Pharma and the psychiatric industry play key roles in this Fourth Reich mind control, convincing people that all their perception is a hallucination and prescribing medication to prevent any memories of Mind Control and to stop them from developing creative paranormal powers. Max also believed that there are numerous underground cities where genetic and Mind Control Experiments are carried out on a large scale on unwilling humans. On top of this Max believed that the world is ruled by Black Magic Magicians and that the assassination of JFK and Princess Diana was a Mind Control Experiment. Other beliefs held by Max Spier was that 9/11 was a false flag and that the Bush and Royal family are reptiles. The basis of this is that if the DNA of the body contains more than 50% reptile, these people have the ability to shapeshift and that everybody has some level of Reptile DNA. This is where the Max Spiers Conspiracy loses ground somewhat. The Max Spiers Conspiracy is linked to black magic and the occult, thus losing substantial credibility.\nA Step too far\nNeedless to say, there are quite a lot of skeptics with regard to the theories of Max Spiers. Aliens, Reptiles and underground bases are quite far flung and unsubstantiated. The idea behind Genetic experimentation and Mind Control is gaining some level of traction, however. Numerous whistleblowers get labeled Conspiracy theorists, as they obviously cannot prove they were experimented upon. One notable journalist, Jon Rappaport, provides a more balanced and realistic view about experiments carried out by the CIA and other Government factions throughout the decades with sources provided.\nThe Max Spiers Conspiracy is yet another unresolved case, with bizarre actions by the official authorities in strange circumstances. While the theories of Max Spiers will never be validated there is no doubt that his death was highly suspicious. And the number of cases against the government with regard to Extra-Terrestrials and Government cover ups seem to be mounting year on year, with more and more coherence among the theorists. Should the Max Spiers Conspiracy theory hold at all, it is more likely that he went too far in investigating the wrong number of high profile individuals, as opposed to it being some sort of systematic, unified governmental cover up.\nMax Spiers\u2019 Last Interview\n\nMax Spiers Documentary",

    "title": "Michael Jackson",
    "content": "Micheal Jackson, the \u201cKing of Pop\u201d, was a hugely influential singer, songwriter, dancer and actor who died in June 2009. His controversial personal life became the subject of much debate in his later years. He released the best-selling album of all time, Thriller, with a sale of over 65 million copies worldwide. He is one of few artists to be introduced to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice and is recognized by the Guinness Book of Records as the most successful entertainer of all time. He has 26 American Music Awards, 13 Grammy Awards and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He was arguably the most influential musical figure of all time, rivaling the Beetles, Johnny Cash, Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley. He released 13 number one singles in the U.S with estimated sales of 350 Million records worldwide. He also supported over 39 charities.\nDespite his many accolades his reputation was all but destroyed from the 90\u2019s onward. His personal appearance and behavior generated huge controversy. In 1993 he was accused of child sex abuse. It was settled out of court with no charges. In 2005 more charges were brought. However, he was found not guilty on all counts. Micheal Jackson admitted to the completion of a sex change operation in order to have children of his own. While on trial for child abuse he was really on trial for much more \u2013 Narcissism, Racial Identity Disorder, Transgenderism, clothing preferences and poor parenting. Fans said he was the victim of much abuse as a child (which is true) while opponents say he used his boyish image and childlike demeanor as tools to molest young children. Micheal Jackson was a conflicting figure in many ways with a complicated sexual identity which seemed to be a mix of gay and straight, man and women, child and adult. When authorities raided his home, they found straight and gay porn which only adds to the confusion.\nMicheal Jackson died from cardiac arrest resulting from acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication at his home in Los Angeles. His physician Conrad Murray was convicted of manslaughter for prescribing inaccurate medication to the singer. The physician also took over 30 minutes to initiate the telephone call upon finding the singer with a bare pulse on the floor. The CPR method he employed to revive Mr. Jackson was also inappropriate, on the bed instead of a hard surface such as a floor. Conrad Murray has since served a two-year prison sentence. Different accounts are given by various agencies surrounding his death. Murray\u2019s attorney stated that Jackson had a pulse when he was put into an ambulance. The Los Angeles Police Department indicated that they found Jackson in full cardiac arrest upon arrival and did not observe a change in his situation on route to the hospital. After two autopsies had been carried out, there was no indication of foul play. The death was ruled a homicide due to the various pharmaceuticals inside of Jackson\u2019s body, though the full toxicology report has not been released. Aside from the pharmaceutical factor, he was reported to be quite healthy.\n1. He never really died\n\nThis theory is associated with any famous individual who dies, from Elvis Presley to Tupac to Princess Diane. There are multiple videos, pictures and claims that Micheal Jackson is alive and well and is hiding out in either Canada or Africa. The pictures often show someone who looks a lot like Micheal Jackson but is far from what could be considered concrete evidence.\nThere are reports that Michael Jackson is now living in Ontario Canada and goes by the name Alain P. Shipments of animals and cosmetics are frequently delivered to the estate of the pale middle-aged man near Lake Dore. Three bodyguards surround the estate at all times and when asked about the bodyguards are reported to just state that \u201cAlain P is a very private individual\u201d. Jackson is also reported to have been seen in Perth, Australia in 2014, as well as in an elevator in Las Vegas. There are hundreds of reported Micheal Jackson sightings, available here. In most sightings, he is reported to be completely covered and dressed completely in black, surrounded by bodyguards.\n2. Killed by Business Interests\nLa Toya Jackson, Michael Jackson\u2019s sister\nMicheal Jackson\u2019s sister, La Toya Jackson, indicates in her memoir Starting Over that her brother was actually killed by business interests in order to profit from his estate. Allegedly he was worked to death with tours and concert and was then given a dangerous concoction of chemicals to put him over the edge. Conrad Murray, the personal physician who was held by the courts to be accountable for the death of Micheal Jackson, is described in the memoirs as \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d. The memoirs indicate that La Toya was told my Michael over and over that he was going to be killed for his estate and that there was a conspiracy against him.\n\u201c\u2018La Toya, I\u2019m going to be murdered for my music publishing catalog and my estate\u201d\nThe brunt of the blame rests on a new business adviser of Jackson\u2019s, Dr. Tohme. As soon as he became Jackson\u2019s chief business adviser, he fired all the key personnel close to Michael. And once he shut out these outside interests he was ale to steer Michael towards business interests profitable form Tohme and his associates. La Toya also indicates that the same business advisers in conjunction with the influence of doctors, mere representatives of the pharmaceutical industry, convinced Michael to take drugs which he had been adverse to taking all his life.\n\u201cMichael didn\u2019t believe in putting any chemicals in his body, and he was devoted to health food throughout his life. When we both lived at home, Michael once became upset with me when he saw me take an aspirin \u2026 \u2018La Toya, why are you taking that aspirin?\u2019 he asked. \u2018That\u2019s a drug.\u201d\nDaughter Paris Jackson also believes that her father was murdered and that it is evident to true fans and anyone with eyes to see. She also quoted, like La Toya, how Michael often mentioned that \u201cthey\u201d were going to get him.\n3. Micheal Jackson Video Game Conspiracy\nAnother theory that has recently resurfaced is that Micheal Jackson played the music on the popular Video Game in the early 1990\u2019s: Nintendo\u2019s Sonic the Hedgehog. The theory emerged from a former Jackson and Sonic the Hedgehog fan, Ben Mallison, a UK resident. \u201cBen\u201d is so named after Jackson\u2019s 1972 Golden Globe-winning title track \u201cBen\u201d. Sonic Three became Ben\u2019s famous game, and he started noticing similarities between Jackson and the Sonic Three soundtrack. By 2003 Ben had been comparing Sonic soundtracks and Jackson music for years. In September of the same year, he started posting that Jackson had a part in the soundtrack of Sonic Three but was for some reason not given any credit. This started a chain reaction of Sonic and Jackson die hard fans who would spread the theory far and wide as well as send thousands of emails to various artists, producers and sound engineers of Sega\u2019s Sonic Three team. The typical response, of course, was that members of the team did not respond to these emails, as it is well documented that the more responses that are given, the more it will encourage people to ask more questions. Sega was the organization responsible for the development of Sonic. One Sonic Forum member claimed that he interviewed Roger Hector, Sonic\u2019s coordinator, who informed him that Sega had worked with Jackson to develop a soundtrack but that they had been scrubbed from the game. While this served to spread the spur the Sonic theorists onward it does not seem plausible on the face of it \u2013 How would the songs be recognized in the first place if they had been scrubbed, and why would Sega pay the money to work with Jackson and then scrub them out?\nA different Sonic enthusiast noticed that Jackson\u2019s \u201cStranger in Moscow\u201d sounded very similar to the Sonic Three ending credits. And James Hansen compiled a video on Youtube of all existing evidence with regard to Michael Jackson producing the soundtrack for Sega\u2019s Sonic Three.\nAnd in 2009 French Magazine Black and White secured an interview with Sonic Three sound artist Brad Buxer, who was also Jackson\u2019s musical director at a certain time. Like Hector, he suggested that Jackson\u2019s music never made it into the final Sonic Three output, but that the Sega team did work with Jackson Sonic Three songs. This was proclaimed as proof that Michael Jackson did, in fact, produce songs for Sonic Three; however, Ken Horowitz, who runs Sega-16, an influential website for Sega enthusiasts,\u00a0deemed the site\u2019s proclamation premature. Kotaku had to clarify. \u201cBuxer\u2019s statements about Michael Jackson\u2019s musical efforts in the Genesis game do not yet constitute proof of anything,\u201d it conceded in an update. \u201cIn other words, our long national nightmare of not knowing whether or not Michael Jackson worked on \u2018Sonic 3\u2019 without a shadow of a doubt is not yet behind us.\u201d\nOther evidence cited is that Hector\u2019s daughter Leslie met Jackson at Sega\u2019s top secret Sonic facility. Jackson was allegedly a fan of the game and the company had released \u201cMoonwalker\u201d, a film based on a Jackson movie. Hector then goes on to say that one of the Sonic Three developers would like to play music for the game. Cirocco Jones, Bobby Brooks, Doug Grigsby III, Brad Buxer, Darryl Ross & Geoff Grace were the six songwriters listed on the credits at the end of Sonic Three. And they all claim that Jackson worked with them to produce the songs. Quotes from the ex-Sega executive Roger Hector states:\n\u201cIt was a big secret \u2013 Sega \u201cdidn\u2019t want the word to get out at all \u2026.I was really impressed with how much of a signature Michael Jackson sound there was in this, and yet, it was all new,\u2026.It clearly had a Michael Jackson sound to it, so that anyone who listened to it would recognize that, gee, that was done by Michael Jackson.\u201d \nAll in all the theory actually seems plausible. Sony at the time wanted to take over the world. After the recording, news of child molestation came out and Sega were wary of attaching Michael\u2019s name to the brand. All the sound artists have claimed that Jackson worked with them on the Sonic project, including former Sega executive Hector. And there is an apparent resemblance between the music of Sonic Three and multiple Michael Jackson soundtracks. Sega cannot admit they worked on it without admitting that they lied before. Which could explain why Roger Hector says that Jackson did work on the soundtracks, but they were removed from the game. Like Roger Hector, Sound engineer Buxer states:\n\u201cI\u2019ve never played the game, so I do not know what tracks on which Michael and I have worked the developers have kept.\u201d\nA clever way to say that we did work with Jackson, but I can\u2019t say for certain that any of his tracks feature in the game as I have never played. Thus avoiding liability.\nConclusion\n\nAs with many conspiracy theories we will never know for sure the true story with regard to the death of Michael Jackson. On the face of it the official story seems to be the most obvious, that an incompetent personal physician gave him the wrong prescription. It is highly unlikely that he is alive. It is possible that he was killed by business interests and that his physician was the \u201cfall guy\u201d, but there is not enough evidence of this to say such is the case. Until more evidence emerges it is best to assume the most probable scenario of death by manslaughter though Conrad Murray.\nThe minor theory that he worked on the Sonic Three soundtrack seems likely, as it crosses the supply of reasonable evidence needed to push it beyond the boundaries of reasonable probability. The testimonies from the sound artists from Sonic Three and Sega Executive Roger Hector lend it much weight.\nDocumentaries and Related Videos\nThere are tons of Michael Jackson documentaries out there about this life and death, as he was an influential figure. We try to include the related ones about the conspiracy of his death.\n\nMichael Jackson last days and True reason behind his death\n\nMichael Jackson: What Really Happened",

    "title": "MK-ULTRA",
    "content": "MK-ULTRA is becoming more and more well known as time goes on. It is increasingly mentioned within conspiracy \u201ccommunities\u201d. The theory about MK-ULTRA is that it was a government funded CIA operation aimed to investigate how the human mind could be controlled through various means. The project was rumored to last for 10 years between the years 1952-1963, with some suggesting operations continued all the way up until 1977. The main proponent of the MK-ULTRA theory is investigative reporter & past US congressional seat candidate Jon Rappaport. More details are available from this official document titled Project MK-ULTRA, The CIA\u2019s program of research in behavioral modification, originally published by the New York Times in 1977.\nHow would MK-ULTRA\u00a0work\nAllegedly, it would start when the subject or patient is very young. It involves electric shocks, torture, lights, spinning tables, drugs, sleep deprivation, hypnosis, mind control, amnesia, etc. If enough trauma is introduced, it results in a split in the personality, as the patient could not deal with the pain of the trauma. The split or sub-personalities would then be programmed to work for the CIA as agents, to do assassinations, blackmail, espionage, etc. The subject would respond to certain triggers which are usually words or symbols. There are people who have testified as the victims of such experiments. And there are reported CIA documents which mention the MK-ULTRA mind control program.\nMK-ULTRA Official Documentation\nOfficial documentation about the MK-ULTRA program is available online. The site includes images of the official documentation.\n\u201c21 December 1954 MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence\u201d\nSUBJECT: Project MKULTRA, Subproject 35\n4. Practically, the control seems to be established as well as circumstances permit. Certainly, as long as the individual is alive and in his present position, we have every reason to expect his complete cooperation in the future as in the past, unless through some act or fault of our own he is alienated. Even in the event of his death or incapacity, there appears to be a reasonable chance of continuing the project. If these probabilities seem sufficient to obtain an adequate return for the expenditure, there can be no legal objection to this aspect of the project.\u201d\nAnd\n\u201cDraft\n5 May 1955\nA portion of the Research and Development Program of TSS/Chemical Division is devoted to the discovery of the following materials and methods:\n1. Substances which will promote illogical thinking and impulsiveness to the point where the recipient would be discredited in public.\n2. Substances which increase the efficiency of mentation and perception.\n3. Materials which will prevent or counteract the intoxicating effect of alcohol.\n4. Materials which will promote the intoxicating effect of alcohol.\n5. Materials which will produce the signs and symptoms of recognized diseases in a reversible way so that they may be used for malingering, etc.\n6. Materials which will render the induction of hypnosis easier or otherwise enhance its usefulness.\n7. Substances which will enhance the ability of individuals to withstand privation, torture, and coercion during interrogation and so-called \u201cbrain-washing\u201d.\n8. Materials and physical methods which will produce amnesia for events preceding and during their use.\n9. Physical methods of producing shock and confusion over extended periods of time and capable of surreptitious use. \u201d\nScope of MK-ULTRA\nMK-ULTRA is held to have originated by the Navy in 1947 as Project CHATTER and then expanded by the CIA in 1950 with Project BLUEBIRD, renamed to PROJECT ARTICHOKE and finally developed into Project MK-ULTRA in 1953. MK-DELTA was the term given to the mind control operations of the CIA abroad. Project SPELLBINDER was used to create Manchurian candidates (sleeper assassins under mind control \u2013 Jason Bourne). MK-SEARCH was the title given for an operation commenced in 1964 to discover the perfect truth drug so that spies would divulge their secrets. Some suggest that practically all-powerful individuals in society are under the mind control of some sort, but that leads to the unanswered question as to who would be doing the programming itself. It is said that we cannot know the full extent of the operations of MK-ULTRA because all documentation was destroyed by CIA director Richard Helms in 1973.\nThe Scope of work done by the CIA was enormous, with the Supreme Court noting that the regime consisted of up to 149 subprojects. The CIA then used front operations such as universities and research centers to carry out the experiments in its name.\nMK-ULTRA is linked to a wide variety of projects and organizations. It is claimed that over two million Americans are victims of CIA mind Control in one way or another. \u201cThe Montauk Boys\u201c is a term given to a style of electronic programming given typically to young boys, and there is allegedly a major Montauk programming center in every major U.S city. The idea is that people who are subjected to mind control are not aware of it, as they have no conscious memory of it. This path swiftly leads to Aliens and time travel.\nMind Control in Psychiatry\nJon Rappoport, Investigator reporter\nMK-ULTRA fits into the broader theory that mind control is all around us, at all times, through advertising, media, radio and television. It has also been linked to psychiatry. Investigator reporter Jon Rappoport believes that the use of psychiatry is all about mind control, with the use of psychiatric drugs all about \u201cstuffing you back in\u201d. The underlying idea being that the mind is infinitely expansive and drugs merely try to put you into a mindset which is considered normal by standard definitions. It is alleged that some of the current psychiatric drugs which are seen today fit the description as per the above CIA draft \u2013 Zoloft, Prozac, Adderall.\nIt is rumored that the father of ADHD, Dr. Leon Eisenberg, confessed in 2009 that ADHD was a prime example of a fictitious disease. While \u201cfather\u201d may be a stretch, there is no doubt that he contributed significantly to the field on which treatment of these types of diseases are based. This rumor is somewhat true. He did say in an interview in German something similar to \u201cADHD is a prime example of a fictitious disease\u201d \u2013 However, when allowing for variances in translation, it can really be interpreted more that ADHD was more that genetic predispositions for ADHD were vastly overestimated.\nDespite this, it is still quite obvious that ADHD is a pure work of fiction. The following is an interview between German Newspaper Der Spiegel and Harvard Psychologist Jerome Kagan:\nSPIEGEL: In the 1960s, mental disorders were virtually unknown among children. Today, official sources claim that one child in eight in the United States is mentally ill. \nKagan: That\u2019s true, but it is primarily due to fuzzy diagnostic practices. Let\u2019s go back 50 years. We have a 7-year-old child who is bored in school and disrupts classes. Back then, he was called lazy. Today, he is said to suffer from ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). That\u2019s why the numbers have soared.\nSPIEGEL: Experts speak of 5.4 million American children who display the symptoms typical of ADHD. Are you saying that this mental disorder is just an invention?\nKagan: That\u2019s correct; it is an invention. Every child who\u2019s not doing well in school is sent to see a pediatrician, and the pediatrician says: \u201cIt\u2019s ADHD; here\u2019s Ritalin.\u201d In fact, 90 percent of these 5.4 million kids don\u2019t have an abnormal dopamine metabolism. The problem is, if a drug is available to doctors, they\u2019ll make the corresponding diagnosis.\nThere are other obvious reasons why ADHD is in fact not an illness or even a disorder. ADHD cannot be proven, as there are no lab tests. There is not even anything that proves it has anything to do with the brain. The symptoms include \u201cbeing easily distracted\u201d and \u201cdoes not like to sit still\u201d. There is simply no objective way to measure a child\u2019s behavior like this. In other words, ADHD does not pass the basic scientific standard in order to be classified as an illness. The only reason that it is so prevalent in society is because of the strength of the pharmaceuticals in its promotion of drugs; an area covered extensively on the web which is outside the ambit of the article.\nMedical Fascism\nThis is a term used to describe Aldous Hudley\u2019s \u201cBrave New World which some claim we are entering into. The idea behind it is that doctors and scientists are seen as experts at life. Thus Because everything has a cause and an effect and the human experience is simply a bunch of chemicals interacting in our brains, there is nothing wrong with simply altering the level of neurotransmitters to maintain a \u2018happy\u2019 human. T Policy Makers would decide how much of each \u201ctype\u201d of human is needed to maintain an \u201ceffective\u201d society. This is known as extreme social engineering.\nTheorists use the frog in boiling water analogy quite often. While the above might seem quite far flung and ridiculous, the Brave New World would occur in stages. Each year there would be more and more diseases which emerge due to various reasons. People would turn to science in order to cure such diseases. The Scientists would invent more labels to solve them. Thus the social engineering would not be announced overnight but would really be a gradual slide over decades. People do not question doctors, and they are looked up to and respected in our society. A prime example is the previously mentioned ADHD, a disorder which has no basis in science but is widely accepted. This is due to the unquestioned respect that is given to the medical industry. And not only is ADHD a fictional disease, but the medical solutions to the imagined problems have very real and physically disastrous consequences for it\u2019s consumers.\nConclusion\nThere is documentation backing up MK-ULTRA. We do have official documentation and a Supreme Court ruling referencing its operations. We have testimonies of people on record. It was initiated as a response after US prisoners of war were experimented on as test dummies for mind-control in North Korea. Thus we do have all reasonable standards of proof for the existence of a very shady practice. Though MK-ULTRA has been discontinued and its head operations had stated that its operations were all but useless, it is naive to believe that it is simply not going on under another acronym.\nThat said it is, like a number of theories, perhaps somewhat overblown. It is cited in every major event or mass shooting that the main figure is for some reason mind controlled. Some go as far to say that most significant political or military figures are under mind control of some sort. This is not the case, and all evidence seems to indicate that the experiments did not go smoothly. Thus at this point, we have evidence that the CIA committed horrific experiments on a number of people in the name of documenting behavioral changes that amounting to mind control. The claims that millions of Americans are under mind control or that every significant figure is under mind control is unsubstantiated and false until proven true.\nWith regard to medical Fascism, the increase of prescription drugs is on the rise; however, the public is now more or less aware of the dangers of over-prescription and of taking supplements in particular. Many are too savvy to blindly take pills from doctors and are waking up, looking to alternative therapies and eastern and preventative medicine. However, it should be noted that this is almost solely due to independent investigative reporters on its effects and the operations of the pharmaceutical industry. Nothing to do whatsoever with a government crackdown looking out for the benefit of its citizens. Thus medical fascism and the brave new world has been deterred not because of government policy, but actually in spite of it.\nDocumentaries and Related Videos\n1.

    "title": "Moon Landing was Faked",
    "content": "Why Faking It?\nIn order to understand the theories, it is first essential to answer the fundamental question: Why? Faking a moon landing is not a trivial matter; it not only requires massive resources, and technical prowess, but also the trust of a large number of people who would be involved in the moon landing conspiracy. In terms of practicality, attempting such a hoax would only make sense if the reasons behind it were solid enough. Most theorists point at the very Space Race as the reason.\nDuring the Cold War, both the United States and the USSR did all they could to outsmart each other, and to demonstrate their technological superiority. The idea of launching rockets and satellites into the space was not only a practical undertaking but also a very clear demonstration of power. It became quite apparent that the faction who would win the Space Race would win the Cold War.\nAstronaut Buzz Aldrin stands on the Moon\nTo support this theory, it is important to consider how complex and expensive it would be to get to the Moon in the first place. Some say that our current technology is just not enough to get there yet, let alone the technology we had in 1969. So, bearing in mind that traveling from the Earth to the Moon was an impossibility, it is not so far-fetched to imagine that somebody in the NASA, or in any other relevant government agency, would come up with the idea of faking such epic accomplishment. After that, the rest would be just a matter of logistics. Knowing the \u201cWhy\u201d makes the \u201cHow\u201d much easier to understand.\nFlapping Flags and Dark Skies\nSome of the main arguments that are related to the moon landing conspiracy stem from the pictures and the video recordings of the event. Many experts have watched over and over those recordings and analyzed the pictures from every point of view. Under such an intense scrutiny, some strange things become apparent:\n1 \u2013 The flag is flapping\nConsidering that the Moon has no atmosphere, that would mean that there is no wind. With no wind, the mere idea of a flapping flag is just preposterous. On the other hand, it is important to consider that the flag was equipped with a traversal pole along the top of the fabric; otherwise, it would have hanged loose, affected only by the satellite\u2019s gravity.\n2 \u2013 There are no stars\nThe pictures show no stars in the background. That fact itself is suspicious. Those trying to disprove the moon landing conspiracy theorists argue that the reflection of the sunlight on the surface of the Moon would be so intense that distant lights, such as stars, would be invisible to the camera, as it happens in big cities by night.\n3 \u2013 There is a rock with a letter \u201cC\u201d in it\nIn one of the pictures, there is a rock with a letter \u201cC\u201d clearly inscribed in it. Conspiracy theorists argue that the rock would be a prop and that the technicians of NASA would have made a gross mistake by leaving it there, with the letter \u201cC\u201d on display. The main argument against that theory is that the letter \u201cC\u201d is just a speckle in the picture\u2019s negative, not a real inscription on a rock.\n4 \u2013 Visible lighting equipment\nIt is quite easy to see two big shining objects in the left side of one of the pictures. Some people defend that the shining objects are in fact lights, mounted on large tripods, that appeared in the picture by accident. Those lights could also be lens flares, as some NASA defenders argue; making public a picture featuring two massive lights would not be the smartest move by the space agency. However, the lights are there, and their shining presence project some shadows over the whole lunar odyssey.\nCelebrity Director\nAstronauts Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong in NASA\u2019s training mockup of the Moon\nMany moon landing conspiracy theorists go quite far in their pursuit of this line of investigation. After all, the video footage and the pictures are the most important proof we have of the veracity of the moon landings, and contesting their truthfulness would make the whole world doubt of the veracity of the entire Space Program. One of the most interesting theories in this regard is the one concerning to the man allegedly in charge of filming the fake landings: Stanley Kubrick.\nIt may seem a bit random, but this name is very well justified. In 1964, Kubrick released his military satire \u201cDoctor Strangelove\u201d. His budget was admittedly small, and the Pentagon had refused him the right to film inside a B-52 bomber, jeopardizing the whole production. Kubrick managed to create some impressive special effects \u2013 even though they would not look that impressive judging by today\u2019s standards \u2013 with close to no money, giving the illusion of shooting inside the real bombers. Somebody at the Pentagon watched the movie and was very impressed by his technical ability.\nAccording to this theory, Kubrick was given unlimited funding to shoot the landings, as he was the perfect man for the job. However, it is hard to imagine that the legendary film director would agree to take part in such a hoax. Some moon landing conspiracy theorists point to the possibility of Kubrick being blackmailed by the Pentagon; after all, his brother Raul Kubrick was back then the leader of the American Communist Party. On top of that, Kubrick would have been given unlimited financial support to shoot his next movie; the Science Fiction Epic \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d.\nScientific Explanations\nLunar Roving Vehicle used on Apollos 15\u201317\nOn an entirely different side of the spectrum, some other groups of conspiracy theorists take a much more scientific approach to the issue. The main proposition of their theories is that it is actually impossible for the human race to send anyone to the Moon, considering our current technological level. One of these theories is based on the existence of the \u201cVan Allen Radiation Belts\u201d; technically speaking, a belt of energetic charged particles that are attached, or held in place, around a magnetized planet by\u00a0its magnetic field. The Earth, for example, has its own Van Allen Radiation Belts. According to these theories, no human would be able to cross those belts unscathed; they would more likely die in the process. Those who defend this thesis also agree that our technological level is not enough to build an effective shield against the Van Allen Radiation Belts.\nIn Other Words\nSome people believe the landings were real, and some don\u2019t. Some challenge the integrity of the clearest pieces of evidence provided by NASA; the video footage and the pictures. Others doubt the scientific and technological factors involved in the moon landings. Whether they were real or not, one thing is certain: since 1969, many people have made a huge effort in analyzing and understanding the evidence and the science that supports it, and have formulated all sorts of theories based on those pieces of evidence. Regardless of personal beliefs, the whole subject is really attractive, and the amount of well thought and deeply considered material created by so many moon landing conspiracy theorists is undeniably fascinating. Maybe even more than the moon landings themselves.\nDocumentaries\nAs well as the professional BBC Documentary, there were amateur fake moon landing scenarios that we found useful in this case, therefore we have included those as well.\n1 \u2013 The moon landing hoax\n\n2 \u2013 The Truth Behind The Moon Landings\n\n3 \u2013 Moon Landing Hoax \u2013 Conspiracy Theory",

    "content": "\u201cThis multinational banking family is a byword for wealth, power \u2013 and discretion\u2026 The Rothschild name has become synonymous with money and power to a degree that perhaps no other family has ever matched\u201d\n\u2013 The Daily Telegraph, UK newspaper\nThis unique family began with their patriarch, Mayer Amschel Rothschild. He was a Jew living in Germany in the 18th century. He was a court Jew or personal banker of the German royals and governors of the Roman states in Hesse-Kassel. In the year 1760, he has begun a banking business in the city of Frankfurt. Over time, he provided his services to the nobles and royals of Germany and accumulated a huge fortune.\nAmschel had five sons and he passed on his wealth to them. They include Nathan Mayer-Rothschild, Salomon-Mayer von Rothschild, James-Mayer de Rothschild, Carl-Mayer von Rothschild and Amschel Mayer Rothschild. These sons went on to establish banks in the European cities of Vienna in Austria, London in the United Kingdom, Naples in Italy, Frankfurt in Germany and Paris in France. Together, they coordinated the banking activities of all of Europe. They laid the foundations of banking and even innovated some of the processes of the banking sector for example high volume, confidentiality, diversification and fast communications. They also formed close relations with the ruling families in the countries where they went to establish banks.\nFor example, Carl Rothschild grew very close with the Italian noble family, the de\u2019 Medici. Since then, the Rothschild family has amassed a family fortune estimated to be $500 trillion by some conspiracy outlets. However, the total wealth of the world was estimated to be at $250 trillion in 2015 according to Credit Suisse\u2019s \u201cGlobal Wealth Report\u201d. However, they do own a large if unspecific sum of money and assets and are so powerful that they have a family coat of arms that is recognized internationally. In addition to that, Sir Evelyn de Rothschild is the personal financial adviser to the Queen of England. Some people say that this fortune was built using unscrupulous means. People believe in the Rothschild conspiracy theories due to their secrecy and also due to their immense fortune.\nThe Rothschild family\nPractically every member of the Rothschild family is very rich and occupies a position of immense power. The following are some of the more well-known and established Rothschild elites.\n#1 Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744 \u2013 1812)\nReferred to as the founding father of international finance, Mayer Amschel Rothschild was ranked number 7 on Forbes list of most influential business men of all time in 2005. An apprenticeship under Jacob Wolf Oppenheimer at the banking firm of Simon Wolf Oppenheimer taught the Mayer much knowledge about human nature and the nature of money itself. He became a dealer in rare coins and this business grew to make him quite rich. By the early 19th Century he had become a prominent international banker and began to issue his own international loans. He had 5 sons, the most famous being Nathan De Rothschild.\n#2 James Mayer De Rothschild (1792 \u2013 1868)\nA German French banker and founder of the French section of the Rothschild dynasty. The fifth and youngest son of Mayer Amschel Rothschild. He was the advisor to two kings in France and played a major role in the railroads and mining industries in the aftermath of the Napoleon wars. He was a shrewd businessman and become one of the richest men in the world with intelligent investments in things such as tea and wine. Some researchers suggest that his wealth would be 5 times that of Bill Gates in today\u2019s terms.\n#3 Nathanial Mayer Rothschild (1777 \u2013 1836)\n\nThe third child of Mayer Amschel Rothschild. Nathan Rothschild is one of the most revered of all Rothschilds. Or perhaps infamous is a better term. There are few in the history of mankind who have pulled off a swindle of such epic proportions, effectively taking control of the economy of Britain by starting a war financing both sides of the war, selling bonds, selling fake news and buying backing the same bonds at ultra-low prices. In one masterstroke, the whole of England was in his grasp and in the hands of the Rothschilds. Nathan Rothschild himself is reported to have described it as \u201cThe best business I ever did\u201d. This tactic of backing both sides and selling fake news is still very prevalent in America, where the news has turned into something of a comedy show. The recent presidential election is a prime example of this phenomenon where professionalism has been thrown out the window. By 1826 Nathan Rothschild was so rich that he lent enough money to the bank of England to avert a liquidity crisis. The only reason he would have done so was to gain even more power and prestige. Rothschilds have a tradition of naming their sons after previous family members. Thus, there are many more Nathan and Nathanial Rothschild\u2019s since the death of Nathanial Mayer Rothschild in 1836.\n#4 David Mayer de Rothschild (1978)\nThe son of Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, David Mayer appears to be more of global traveler and human rights activist then the stereotypical global elite associated with being a Rothschild. He has an interest in climate change, travels frequently and authors books on ecology and sustainable living. While the tendency is to categorize all Rothschilds as evil these families are not as integrated as they once were and he could simply have grown up with different interests than world domination. In 2002 he studied at the London College of Naturopathic Medicine where he received a diploma.\n#5 Lynn Forester de Rothschild (1954)\nLady De Rothschild is a British American business woman who happens to be the CEO of E.L. Rothschild. She is a promoter of an ideology called inclusive capitalism and is the wife of Sir Evelyn Robert de Rothschild. E.L Rothschild owns \u201cThe Economist\u201d magazine as well as an independent wealth management firm. It also has economic and agricultural interests, and it seems that the Rothschild enterprises are showing much interest in food and energy, two very valuable resources.\n#6\u00a0The Lady Serena, Baroness Rothschild (1935)\u00a0\nBaroness Rothschild is the wife of none other than Jacob Rothschild and the owns a number of thoroughbred British racehorses. She married Jacob Rothschild in 1961 and had 4 children, Hannah Mary Rothschild, Beth Matilda Rothschild, Emily \u201cEmmy\u201d Magda Rothschild and Nathaniel Philip Victor James Rothschild. Lady Serena comes from the aristocracy and is the daughter of Sir Philip Gordon Dunn, Bt., and Lady Mary Sybil St. Clair-Erskine\n#7\u00a0Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild(1936)\nAfter Nathan Rothschild, Jacob occupies the chief spot as head honcho of the Rothschild empire. Born in 1936, he is a famous British banker and honorary President of the Institute for Jewish Policy Research. He is known as the 4th Baron Rothschild, the son of Victor Rothschild(the 3rd Baron Rothschild). There was known to be some rivalry between the 4th Baron and his cousin Sir Evelyn Robert de Rothschild. Jacob has significant ties to both the tobacco and the oil industry. In 2003 the shares of a Russian oil industrialist mysteriously passed to him under a business arrangement. He was deputy chairman of BSkyB television and was director of RHJ International until his retirement in 2008. He was a close personal friend of Princess Diana and maintains links with Henry Kissinger, Ronald Regan, Bill Clinton and Margaret Thatcher. He is married to Serena Mary Dunn, granddaughter of Canadian financier Sir James Dunn. He is a banker, philanthropist and industrialist with many ties and linked to important people and industries as well as many positions, connections and awards. Forbes has estimated the net worth to be around $5 billion, but again it is impossible to verify such estimates.\n#8\u00a0Edmond Adolphe de Rothschild (1926 \u2013 1997)\nBorn in France and died in Switzerland. He was a former member of the infamous Bilderberg group. Like practically all Rothschilds he spent a number of years in the banking industry after finishing his law degree. In 1953, he set up his own investment bank. He did not lead the extravagant lifestyle so typical of Rothschild bankers and he focused his business activity in Switzerland, the home of finance. He was awarded the legion of honor in 1994 and was a passionate Zionist. In an interview with a French magazine he stated:\n\u201cI am fundamentally a citizen of the world, devoted to France, where I was born, to Switzerland, where I was made welcome, and to Israel because I am a Jew\u201d\n#9\u00a0Leopold David de Rothschild (1927 \u2013 2012)\nThe fourth and youngest child of Nathan De Rothschild. A talented pianist and violinist, he spent much of his earlier years involved in the musical scene in London and also served in the Royal Navy for two years. But all Rothschild paths seem to converge back to banking. He worked for Morgan Stanley and Glyn Mills and Co before becoming a partner in Rothschild and Sons in 1956. While he remained a banker his whole life he always maintained an interest in music and had many philanthropic pursuits like most Rothschilds.\n#10\u00a0Sir Evelyn De Rothschild (1931)\nSir Evelyn De Rothschild is rumored to be worth over $20 billion. It can safely be said that the public will never know for certain the exact wealth of such elites. He could be worth far more or far less, as the activities of such powerful entities are far beyond ordinary scrutiny. Who knows how many layers of security and subterfuge lie between the actual value of assets and liabilities and the official published accounts? In truth, probably nobody aside from the Rothschilds themselves. Sir Evelyn De Rothschild is/was\nSir Evelyn De Rothschild is rumored to be worth over $20 billion. It can safely be said that the public will never know for certain the exact wealth of such elites. He could be worth far more or far less, as the activities of such powerful entities are far beyond ordinary scrutiny. Who knows how many layers of security and subterfuge lie between the actual value of assets and liabilities and the official published accounts? In truth, probably nobody aside from the Rothschilds themselves. Sir Evelyn De Rothschild is/was financial advisor to Queen Elizabeth II, the chairman of Rothschild\u2019s Continuation Holdings AG, co-founder (along with his wife, Lynn Forrester de Rothschild), of the holding company E.L. Rothschild and nonexecutive chairman of N M Rothschild and Sons. He holds quite a number of positions. He was director chairman of The Economist, United Race Courses, and British Merchant Banking and Securities House Association. He was also Director of IBM United Kingdom Holdings Limited, as well as and Deputy Chairman of Milton Keynes Development Corporation. Sir Evelyn served as the director of Lord Beaverbrook\u2019s newspaper group and Lord Black\u2019s Daily Telegraph newspaper. Like Nathan and Evelyn he has amassed considerable power and positions in his international banking career. He has three children with his divorced wife Jeanette Bishop and was knighted in 1989. He spent his honeymoon at the Whitehouse. His 3 children are Jessica, Anthony and David Mayer De Rothschild.\nOther notable members of the Rothschild family include Jeff Rothschild ($1.8 billion) and Benjamin De Rothschild ($1.6 billion). According to Investopedia, the Rothschild family controls $2 trillion worth of assets today. However, this figure does not add up when calculating the net worth of individual Rothschilds. It is safe to assume that the majority of their wealth is hidden and they are doubtless pulling strings and investing for the future. The Rothschilds do not hold their wealth in public companies and therefore it is not possible to estimate their holdings and they are under no legal obligation to disclose their operations or provide proof of key financial metrics such as revenue and profit. Their diverse array of holdings including insurance, mining, natural resources, renewable energy, finance and banking, real estate and even charitable organizations, most likely for reputation management. We have not heard the last of the Rothschild family and they are still very powerful and operating behind the scenes.\nRothschild Conspiracy \u2013 War is profitable\nThe Rothschild family are known to have funded the losers and the winners of all wars since the Napoleonic Wars of 1803 to 1815. They fund both sides so that whichever side wins, they profit. In 1815, Napoleon Bonaparte was campaigning to take over Britain itself. Seeing an opportunity, the Rothschild family got together and made a plan. Jacob Rothschild was stationed in Paris, France. He was told to fund Napoleon\u2019s war effort to conquer Britain. On the other hand, Nathan Rothschild, stationed in London was told to fund General Wellington\u2019s war effort against Napoleon. The two sons did that and the war raged. Soon, the family decided that it was more profitable to them if Britain won the war and the British royal family was indebted to the Rothschild family. Thus, Jacob limited the funds to Napoleon\u2019s army and General Wellington began to win.\nNathan was involved in the British stock market. Shrewdly, he saw an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone. Knowing that Britain was winning the war, he started selling off his British bonds in lump sums. Other traders on the floor saw his actions and concluded that France must be winning and Britain losing. They also dumped their British bonds in large sums. As a result, the price of the bond plummeted and became very low. This caused an economic crash in Britain. Once Nathan saw that the other traders had sold all their bonds, he began buying them back at ridiculously low prices. He was from the richest family in the world so he could easily buy them all. He actually managed to buy all the bonds that the Bank of England had issued that year. When the news reached the ordinary citizens that Britain had won the war, the value of the British bond rose so high that Nathan made a profit of 20% on all his investment in the bonds. In addition to that, since the Rothschild family owned all the bonds in Britain, they effectively owned the British economy and the Bank of England. Ever since, the Rothschild family have used their money and power to design the economies of other countries in the world. They have also created economic crashes to make a profit out of them, just like they did in Britain in 1815.\nThe Rothschild Family Bank Conspiracy\n\u201cGive me control of a nation\u2019s money supply and I care not who makes the laws\u201d\n\u2013 Mayer Amschel Rothschild \u2013 Rothschild Dynasty Founder.\nThe Rothschilds have long been linked with debt and banking. The Rothschild family bank conspiracy dates all the way back to Mayer Amschel Rothschild. Ultimately, the Rothschild bank is a complex network of ownership with ties to various financial institutions and multiple acquisitions and mergers in recent years. Figuring out who owns what is the key difficulty in compliance industries in a post-2008 world of beneficial owners and controlling parties in financial institutions.\nUltimately the chief Rothschild conspiracy theory is that they are controlling the world through debt and usury and that this plan is centuries in the making. They are rumored to own the federal reserve. The Federal Reserve is the private bank that lends money to the US government at an interest rate. The end result of this is that the average citizen gets poorer and poorer by the day under the guise of saving the economy, when in fact it just makes things worse for everybody. Aside from the money lenders. The US government then invents complex reasons as to why this is an intelligent decision when in fact it is obvious that it is as blatant a robbery as has ever taken place. It is testimony to the power of advertising and appearances that people believed for so long that we could print our way out of debt even though the money goes straight to the military industrial complex and to already wealthy financial institutions who lend to the poor at extortionate rates and then call in the debt when the economy goes up due to excessive money printing. And the show goes on and on. The end result is that $21 trillion of US debt is ultimately owed to the owners of the Federal Reserve. And the owners of the Federal Reserve are the Rothschilds. There has yet to be a public rebut to this simple fact. The Fed is private and the majority of debt is owed to the private owners, to which all evidence points to being the Rothschilds. To put it more simply, more than 500 million people are in debt to less than 10 key players. This last paragraph is essentially a summary of the whole New World Order and Rothschild Conspiracy.\nKeeping wealth in the family\n\nThe original founder of the Rothschild family, Mayer Amschel Rothschild personally dictated that the female descendants of the family were not to receive any direct inheritance. This meant that a Rothschild lady could not inherit wealth from her father or mother. As soon as they reached the age at which they should marry, they were disconnected from the family wealth so that they had to figure out a way to fend for themselves. This was an indirect way to ensure that these girls married back into the Rothschild family. Having lived like princesses all their lives, it made more sense to marry their cousins, inherit the wealth of their new husbands and then continue to live like royals. Thus, for over 200 years, the Rothschild family have intermarried among themselves. This is officially known as avunculate marriage. It is where an uncle can marry a niece and an aunt can marry their nephew. Nathan Rothschild married his brother Carl\u2019s eldest daughter.\nThe Rothschilds and the Protocols of Zion\nMany have linked the Rothschilds to the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion. Essentially Zionism is an ideal held by Jewish citizens that they are entitled to a state where they are free of persecution. Antisemitism is the idea that Jews are evil and believe themselves better than the \u201cgoyim\u201d/\u201d Gentiles\u201d (People who are not Jews). Antisemitism has raged for centuries and the Jews have been driven out of many countries. The question is whether or not there is any real substance to these claims.\nIt cannot really be argued that the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion is a chilling read and that everything in those documents has come to pass in detail. Great detail. And anyone who reads the document with an open mind and no preconceptions will sense at least some truth in them. Because over a hundred years ago a document stated that debt and usury would bring down nations, that the populace would be controlled through media, that governments would be in debt to corporations, that war would run rife through the world, that a one world government would be established along with a one world currency, that religion would be abolished and that the class of nobility (viewed as the one defense of the lower classes against the elites) would be destroyed. All has come to pass as stated, and these are amazing predictions from a document that is over 100 years old. Though the documents are \u201cproven\u201d to be a forgery, the fact remains that the protocols are as prophetic as they come. It is easier for most minds to dismiss evidence that contradicts their views, beliefs and reality, which is why the protocols are simply accepted as forgeries and antisemitism.\nDespite the fact that the Rothschilds may be actively trying to dominate the world using many of the procedures set out in the protocols of the learned elders of Zion, the Rothschilds are not primarily Jewish. While many Rothschilds were supporters of Zionism, some members of the family were actually opposed to the creation of a Jewish state, which is the essence of what Zionism actually is. Lord Victor Rothschild was against granting asylum to Jewish survivors of the Holocaust. The link between the Rothschilds and Zionism is not clear and established. And while there may be a certain group of elite Zionists trying to take over the world through debt and usury, over 99% of Zionists are simply Jewish people looking for a place to call home.\nThe Rothschild Zionist Theory Continued\nMany people believe that the Rothschild family are Zionist Jews. There are two takes on the Zionist theory. One is that Zionists are willing to do whatever it takes to take control of a country and convert everyone to their religion and that they do this primarily through money. The other is that Zionists are a displaced people looking for a homeland.\nThe Anti-Zionist stance indicates that they have ensured that the most powerful people in the world are Jewish like them. This has been achieved by intermarriage. In Jewish culture, if a woman is Jewish then her children are Jews by birth. Conspiracy theorists speculate that Catherine, the current Duchess of Cambridge and wife of Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge is a Jewish lady since her mother, Madam Goldsmith is Jewish as well. This means that their son, Prince George is Jewish. If he takes over the throne as King George, he will be a Jewish, Zionist King on the most powerful throne in the world. With this much power, any country in the world will be his for the taking. If he decides to take over the Muslim countries in the name of the Jewish religion, then he can easily turn the world into a single religion with him as the head. Remembering that Sir Evelyn de Rothschild is the current financial adviser of the British royal family, the Rothschild influence will extend into the future King George\u2019s rule. As conspiracy theorists believe, it would greatly empower the Rothschild family.\nOther Rothschild Conspiracy Theories\nThe Rothschilds have been linked to practically every single conspiracy theory in some form or another. And this is aside from the Rothschild bank conspiracy that we have all heard about. The Rothschild conspiracy theories are growing in number with every passing day. Rothschild conspiracy theories have started with the rise of Mayer Amschel Rothschild and have been in circulation since.\nOne such conspiracy theory is that the Rothschilds were the cause of the Holocaust. This conspiracy theory makes little sense. First, because not all Rothschilds were Zionists, and many were not advent Jews in the traditional sense. Second, one Rothschild, Baroness Elizabeth de Rothschild (1902-1945), died in a concentration camp (she was the only Rothschild to die as a result of the Holocaust). And finally, it is simply much more likely that the Rothschilds were one of the enemies of Hitler, the very powers he was trying to exterminate. It stands to reason more that both the Nazis and the Rothschilds had plans to take over the world, with the Rothschilds proving a tougher and more intelligent group and ultimately winning out. Either way whoever won the war would end up in debt to the Rothschilds, but Hitler was far more volatile and fanatical and less likely to be controlled and manipulated.\nOther Rothschild conspiracy theories are that the Rothschilds sank the Titanic in order to set up the Federal Reserve and that the Rothschilds are a group of inter dimensional reptiles wearing human clothing. This is an ever-popular conspiracy theory initially put forward by conspiracy theorist David Icke that the global elites are all Aliens in disguise. Possibly the biggest conspiracy theory in relation to the Rothschilds are that they control up to 80% of the world\u2019s wealth with a net worth of over $500 trillion. This is simply not possible and there is little evidence to back it up. Just because we don\u2019t know how much the Rothschilds actually own does not give us leave to speculate that they possibly own this much wealth. We might as well say they own $500 zillion dollars. Neither claim is relying on logic, evidence or reason so the actual imaginary figure does not mean all that much. This is a prevalent myth and all we can say at this time is that the exact wealth of the Rothschilds is unknown. It is basically an extension of the anti-Semitic conspiracy that Jews control the media, the banking system the oil, the government and everything else, but because they own everything nothing can be proven.\nThe Rothschild Family today 2017\nWhat about the Rothschild family today 2017? In the 20th Century the Rothschilds took a low profile. They had made their name and established their wealthy, it was time to pull out the puppet strings and use them from afar as operations went underground. Rothschild enterprises are on a smaller scale than what they used to be. But this is contended by many theorists, who argue that this is due to design in that the Rothschilds do not want the extent of their interests to be revealed to the public. Many claim that they are still incredibly rich but that official figures deliberately put them at a mere fraction of their real worth. In the last couple of decades, the Rothschilds have been selling their banking operations in Europe. Over 20 % of Rothschild Continuation Holdings was sold in 2005 to a company called Jardine Strategic, which is a subsidiary of Jardine, Matheson & Co. of Hong Kong. In November 2008, Rabobank Group, the leading investment and private bank in the Netherlands, acquired 7.5% of Rothschild Continuation Holdings AG. Rabobank and Rothschild entered into a co-operation agreement in the fields of mergers and acquisitions\nThe Ccary Conclusion\nThe Rothschilds have had an enormous impact on world affairs and there can be little doubt that a family of this wealth, power and intelligence did not use their influence to influence political affairs in various ways. They are well connected and well established. While they have withdrawn somewhat from banking they seem to have put much of their wealth into natural resources and food. These are two areas that are set to be of continued importance in the future in terms of a growing global population. And for conspiracy theorists the story adds up \u2013 control of the food supply and energy are the next logical steps after the financial system has been locked up with everyone in debt. They will keep consolidating power until a one world government and new world order is established with the Rothschilds as central players with complete domination of the world\u2019s resources. They have also been strongly linked with the mystical Illuminati group. To a degree the phrases \u201cIlluminati\u201d,\u201dDeep State\u201c, Rothschilds and \u201cNew World Order\u201d are synonymous.\nThen again, it could be that the Rothschilds are now fragmented and do not really exist anymore. There is no driving force and no close ties as the Rothschild descendants are all doing their own thing, in a manner of speaking. The closest thing remaining to a real Rothschild family business is the Rothschild Group, a multinational banking company. Perhaps, like the Rockefellers, they will simply fall into obscurity like many other great families. Nobody can say for certain.",

    "title": "Nikola Tesla",
    "content": "Nicola Tesla was a Serbian inventor, engineer and physicist. It is arguable that there are more conspiracy theories linked to Nicola Tesla than anyone else in history. The claims have grown with time and most are exaggerated. Tesla is best known for his invention of Alternating Current (\u201cAC\u201d). He worked with Thomas Edison in 1884 before striking out on his own. It is becoming generally accepted that Edison was financially tight with business associates and that he kept reneging on agreements with Tesla. This forced Tesla to partner with two businessmen and formed Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing. Over 300 patents were attributed to Tesla in his lifetime in over 25 countries. Many of his patents were for futuristic and far-reaching concepts.\nHe was also hired by George Westinghouse for a short time in a consultancy capacity. His AC fought against Thomas Edison\u2019s Direct Current(\u201cDC\u201d) in what became known as\nThomas Edison\nthe \u201cWar of Currents\u201d. There were many legal battles involving patents over technology, and many large Corporations took an interest. Tesla was a futurist and his fans today proclaim that his work was instrumental to all modern technology. He was the first to propose wireless communication, x-rays and radio remote control. Tesla would live most of his life in New York Hotels and used the money he earned from his patents to finance his own projects. Tesla did not have time to act on his many ideas. Some of his research did not fit into the early 20th century, so he contented himself with publishing his ideas without a patent, including solar panels, a rocket engine design, an ultra high vacuum and directed beams. Other ideas were simply written down with no intent to patent or publish. Some of his wilder theories were said to touch upon time travel, invisibility, antigravity and free energy.\nB. A. Behrend, distinguished author and engineer:\n\u201cWere we to seize and to eliminate the results of Mr. Tesla\u2019s work, the wheels of industry would cease to turn, our electric cars and trains would stop, our towns would be dark, our mills would be dead and idle.\u201d\nNikola Tesla Core Conspiracy \u2013 Free Energy\nFree Energy is at the heart of Tesla conspiracies and features on most of the more far-flung conspiracy theories. As the theory goes, \u201cThe Powers That Be\u201d are opposed to free energy at all costs. Free energy would result in the empowerment of the individual. Because everything is related to energy. If energy were free, there would be no more electric or oil bills. Devices would be manufactured which completed much manual labor. And this fee energy could be applied to diseases of the mind and body. Thus everyone would be richer, not tied down to corporate jobs and debt, and as such would engage in positive processes which would be relaxing, empowering and rejuvenating. Thus \u201cThe Powers That Be\u201d are alleged to have systematically suppressed all devices which purport to not only suggest free energy but those which improve on the efficiency of existing models, such as the mileage in car engines. Tesla is said to have discovered free energy, but his works were suppressed during his lifetime and stolen after his death.\nWardenclyffe Tower, Tesla Tower\nThe free energy conspiracy is linked to the Wardenclyffe Tower/Tesla tower. This tower was initially built by Tesla to compete with Marconi\u2019s radio based telegraph system, to transmit messages across the Atlantic to England. It is contended by theorists that the backers of the Tesla Tower project, withdrew funding as this tower would have been able to produce limitless and free power worldwide. Tesla had planned to transmit power as well as communication initially. Tesla was warned that no more than $150,000 would be used to fund the project by J.P. Morgan (The individual, not the bank). In the meantime, Marconi had already succeeded in transmitting a letter across the Atlantic. Tesla then proceeded to explain to J.P Morgan that he needed more funding for a different aim than that initially given to J.P. Morgan \u2013 he now wanted additional funding to investigate if he could send power in addition to communication. Morgan had already told Tesla he did not want to spend more than $150,000 and Tesla did not reveal to him initially that he was also intending to investigate whether power could be transmitted. This theory is often summarized that Morgan did not want citizens receiving free electricity, radio and television and sold the Tesla Tower for scrap when he heard. This is not the case and a gross and inaccurate oversimplification. It is also contended that the belief that transmission of power = free energy is blown completely out of context and is simply not the way the facility was designed. Much of Tesla\u2019s life was about providing free energy to the masses via wireless waves with no wires or ground infrastructure.\nThe patents that Tesla had for free energy are also said by scientists to be completely overblown and taken out of context by free energy conspiracy theorists. Tesla\u2019s patent for radiant energy is said to be no more than a patent on electromagnetic energy \u2013 Essentially his devices would be no more of a free energy device than a solar panel, which converts one form of energy to another. Theorists content that Tesla had plans to tap energy from another dimension or from the \u201cether\u201d which was of a limitless supply. However, on the investigation into Tesla\u2019s devices and patents, they are energy conversion devices from already known energy supplies. Of course, his theories may have laid the foundations to what we already have including x-rays, wireless communications and alternating currents, which are marvelous inventions and are quite efficient. However, they do not constitute \u201cfree\u201d energy, which means that one unit of energy in would result in two or more units of energy out. Many scientists contend that Tesla\u2019s works are brilliant enough as they are and there is no need to insert any conspiracy to make them seem more interesting.\nNikola Tesla \u2013 Killed by Nazi\u2019s\nOne conspiracy theory contends that Nikola Tesla was actually assassinated by Hitler\u2019s personal bodyguard and assassin, Otto Skorzeny. This theory stems from Eric Bermen, who alleges that he met the bodyguard by chance who has since been given a new identity. Bermen got the confession from Skorzeny along with a shoe-box of photographic evidence. Tesla was suffocated on Jan 6th, 1943 by Skorzeny and fellow Nazi Reinhard Gehlen, at the age of 86 (allegedly). After the murder, they stole the contents of Tesla\u2019s safe, which they gave to Hitler. All these innovations would have been returned to the U.S after the war which they won. Skorzeny says that Hitler did not commit suicide, that he helped Hitler escape via plane to Austria and the dental records prove that the double though to be Hitler was not him, but this information was kept hidden by the Americans.\nNicola Tesla Extreme Conspiracy theory \u2013 Time Traveling Experiments\nOne online theory by Commander X goes as far as to suggest that Tesla conducted numerous time traveling experiments. Using a combination of high voltage electricity and magnetic fields Tesla is said to have been able to traverse the space-time continuum. He is said to have been able to have seen the past, present and future all at the same time but was simultaneously rendered paralyzed in this state. New York Herald 1895:\n\u201cI am afraid,\u201d said Tesla, \u201cthat you won\u2019t find me a pleasant companion tonight. The fact is I was almost killed today. The spark jumped three feet through the air and struck me here on the right shoulder. If my assistant had not turned off the current instantly in might have been the end of me.\u201d\nNicola Tesla and the Philadelphia Experiment\nTesla is linked to the Philadelphia experiment, where it is alleged that the US destroyer Eldridge turned invisible in a shipyard in Philadelphia before reappearing. This was a project conducted by the military on the technology given to them by Tesla. The experiment is said to have resulted in many mental illnesses with regard to the sailors onboard the vessel. Highly charged, rotating magnetic fields invented by Tesla are said to be the basis for invisibility and this is the technology said to be relied upon by the military in the Philadelphia Experiment.\nThe work of Nicola Tesla is reportedly used extensively by the military, including particle beam and radio frequency weaponry.\nMysterious Tunguska Explosion of 1908\n\nIn Tunguska Siberia 1908 one of the biggest cosmic impacts to have ever taken place occurred. It took decades for the Mysterious Tunguska Explosion to become common knowledge outside of Siberia, Russia being a largely secretive place at the time. On top of this, the climate in the region was very harsh and it was 20 years before an expedition to the area was mounted by Western scientists. When the team arrived at the epicenter of the blast, they found trees that had been stripped of all branches, a feat which requires fast moving shock waves.\nThe region is extremely remote and sparsely populated. Over 2000 square kilometers of forest were devastated, all of which was scorched for decades to come. The blast is estimated at 40 Megatones and the mass of the crashed object is estimated to be at 100,000 tons. What the object is made up of is not clear. Reports from Tungsten tribesmen at the time were said to have described a bright, flaming object hurtling towards the ground, with a huge plume of dust and smoke on impact and a deafening noise. Thunderclaps were reported to have been heard up to 500 miles away. A black rain of debris showered the area after the blast and is said to have caused all sorts of climate change all over the planet. Visibility was decreased worldwide and brilliant sunsets were reported in the aftermath of the impact. This is the only time in earth\u2019s recorded history that a large meteorite collided with the earth\u2019s surface. It should be noted that the size of this meteorite is estimated to have only been 60 meters in diameter. A huge global effect for such a small rock. Should this impact have occurred a few hours later, it could have hit central Europe, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of people, or more if it hit a well-populated city.\nThe explosion is linked by theorists to Nikola Tesla. Tesla was allegedly on working on a wireless torpedo, a remote controlled boat he offered to the U.S Navy. The exact specifics behind this theory are unknown, but the two most common variants are that Tesla was testing out his death ray or some type of machine or that his experiments actually attracted a meteorite itself. The timeline of 1908 does not lend weight to the theory. The Tesla Tower was only used until 1907 and most of it\u2019s operational capacities were disabled in 1903 when Westinghouse company removed most of the equipment. It seems to be a very far flung theory built on an already far-flung theory with no evidence, testimonies, logic or reason involved. Nikola Tesla did make reference to such devices however the idea that they are linked to the devastating explosion in 1908 is ridiculous.\nNikola Tesla\u2019s Death Ray Machine\nTesla did work on particle accelerators which aimed to send a concentrated beam of energy in a vertical line without diffusion. It is not known whether or not he was actually successful in building the device, but there is no evidence that he did. Many others claimed to have invented it in the 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s, such as Guglielmo Marconi and Edwin R. Scott. Tesla claimed until his death that he had successfully invented the death ray which he called teleforce.\n\n\u201cthis invention of mine does not contemplate the use of any so-called \u2018death rays\u2019. Rays are not applicable because they cannot be produced in requisite quantities and diminish rapidly in intensity with distance. All the energy of New York City (approximately two million horsepower) transformed into rays and projected twenty miles, could not kill a human being, because, according to a well known law of physics, it would disperse to such an extent as to be ineffectual. My apparatus projects particles which may be relatively large or of microscopic dimensions, enabling us to convey to a small area at a great distance trillions of times more energy than is possible with rays of any kind. Many thousands of horsepower can thus be transmitted by a stream thinner than a hair, so that nothing can resist \u201c\nHe also stated it could:\n\u201cdestroy anything approaching within 200 miles \u2026 [and] will provide a wall of power[ in order to] make any country, large or small, impregnable against armies, airplanes, and other means for attack\u201d\nHis intention to create a death ray go against the grain in terms of his popular perception as the father of the 21st century. He was trying to make weapons of mass destruction.\nTesla was a homosexual\nThis theory springs from the fact that Tesla took a vow of celibacy. He said that he was devoted to science and could not fully devote himself if he had a family to take care of. He did state that he fell in love with a woman while in school when he was young. He was also known to have been friendly with a number of women who were financially connected, such as Anne Morgan and Ava Astor. In 1927 he told a Serbian reporter than he had never touched a woman. Margaret Cheney in her autobiography states that Tesla may have been a homosexual, a point echoed by Paul Baker. Tesla was heavily influenced by Buddhists such as Swami Vivekananda, who believed that celibacy would result in a redirection of the sexual energy upwards, which Tesla put towards his inventions.\nNikola Tesla Opposition\nWhile Tesla is commended by many as the father of physics and the inventor of the 21st century, there is a considerable amount of scorn and perhaps even envy of the inventor. It is held that he was a showboater with wild dreams which never came to fruition, and was well known for his showmanship. He claimed to have had a dynamic theory of gravity which he never published. He criticized Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity however he never provided any alternate theory. He tried to establish a free energy device for the masses via electromagnetic induction, but this never came to pass. And some also hold that he tried to sell a device to the military that would end all wars, though this it most probably a conspiracy theory in itself. And it is hard to imagine that the military would simply have no time for such a device when it pretty much sums up what the military is all about. He is criticized as being an eccentric individual with a possible case of Asperger\u2019s Syndrome as well as Obsessive Compulsion Disorder.\nHowever, these criticism\u2019s fail in comparison to what he did do \u2013 provide the world with Alternating Current which it runs on to this day, not to mention wireless communications which are used to this day, including Bluetooth and mobile hotspots. Many of his theories are still in use to this day.\nTesla Conspiracy Conclusion\nMost of the theories surrounding Tesla have little standing. Free energy does not hold up, nor does the belief that Morgan refused to continue financing the project due to free energy. There is no evidence that he was killed by Hitler\u2019s bodyguard, Otto Skorzeny, other than his testimony. And the claims with regard to the Tunguska Explosion are simply beyond ridiculous, that Tesla was responsible for an asteroid hitting the earth. Claims relating to a disappearing naval destroyer and time travel are likewise ridiculous. He may have been a homosexual. However there is no evidence to support this claim, and all evidence does indicate that he was in fact celibate as claimed. And it is possible, yet highly unlikely, that he finished his death ray and sold it to the military. There are actually more Tesla conspiracies than the ones covered here, and they get more and more convoluted as time goes on.\n\nTesla\u2019s contribution to the world cannot be underestimated. The world runs on the ideas of Nikola Tesla. However, the Tesla haters may have some merit to their arguments. Some of Nikola Tesla\u2019s views are chilling. He was an atheist and believed men were no more than machines, governed by external stimuli. He believed in eugenics \u2013 Much like Aldous Huxley\u2019s Brave New World. Undesirable traits are to be bred out of the human being with social/chemical engineering. Marriage should be made more difficult. No one who is not a desirable parent should not be allowed to produce a child. As brilliant as he was it is perhaps best that he stuck to the engineering of the mechanical and not the social. To inventing and not to politics. And he proclaimed proudly of his death ray, which would destroy anything approaching within 200 miles. However to qualify this statement \u2013 This would be a defensive device placed around a city as a defense mechanism. Tesla\u2019s view was that this was the only way to stop warfare among the human race.\n\u201d If no country can be attacked successfully, there can be no purpose in war. My discovery ends the menace of airplanes or submarines, but it insures the supremacy of the battleship, because battleships may be provided with some of the required equipment. There might still be war at sea, but no warship could successfully attack the shore line, as the coast equipment will be superior to the armament of any battleship. \u201c\nDocumentaries and Movies\nHere are some of the documentaries surrounding Nikola Tesla, his theories, findings, his death and of course the conspiracy theories.\nThe Missing Secrets Of Nikola Tesla\n\nTesla The Race to Zero Point Free Energy\n\nNikola Tesla\u2019s Biography and Life New Full Documentary\n\nThe SECRET of NIKOLA TESLA\nBelow is a movie dedicated to Nikola Tesla.",

    "title": "Operation Northwoods",
    "content": "\nOperation Northwoods\u2019 Content\nThe content of Operation Northwoods is self-explanatory and leaves no room for ambiguity. It outlines clearly and precisely acts of terrorism which could then be blamed on Cuba and provide the basis for starting a war which would be of huge benefit to the military Industrial Complex. Pages Seven and Eight of the Joint Chief of Staff Document are the most telling.\n\u201cA series of well coordinated incidents will be planned to take place in and around Guantanamo to give genuine appearance of being done by hostile Cuban forces.\na. Incidents to establish a credible attack (not in\nchronological order):\n(1) Start rumors (many). Use clandestine radio.\n(2) Land friendly Cubans in uniform \u201cover-the-fence\u201d\nto stage attack on the base.\n(3) Capture Cuban (friendly) sabateurs inside the\nbase.\n(4) Start riots near the entrance to the base (friendly\nCubans).\n(5) Blow up ammunition inside the base; start fires.\n(6) Burn aircraft on airbase (sabatage).\n(7) Lob morter shells from outside of base into base.\nSome damage to installations.\n(8) Capture assault teams approaching from the sea\nof vicinity of Guantanamo City.\n(9) Capture militia group which storms the base.\n(10) Sabotage ship in harbor; large fires \u2014 napthalene.\n(11) Sink ship near harbor entrance. Conduct funerals\nfor mock-victims (may be lieu of (10)).\nb. United States would respond by executing offensive\noperations to secure water and power supplies, destroying\nartillery and mortar emplacements which threaten the base.\nc. Commence large scale United States military operations.\nA \u201cRemember the Maine\u201d incident could be arranged: We could blow up a US ship in Guantanamo Bay and blame Cuba. Casualty lists in US newspapers would cause a helpful wave of national indignation.\nWe could develop a Communist Cuban terror campaign in the Miami area, in other Florida cities and even in Washington. \u201c\nPresident Kennedy\u2019s refusal of Operation Northwoods\n\nPresident Kennedy was reported to have refused the creative strategies from his military advisors as to how to win the Cold War against Russia. The underlying mentality of the generals was also to stop communism at all costs, and even with civilian casualties, it was a war that at the time had to be won. Kennedy was reported to have stated to the Joint Chief of Staff that he could not envisage any type of circumstance \u201c which would justify and make desirable the use of American forces for overt military action\u201d in Cuba. The Chairperson for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Lyman L Leminitzer, was eventually replaced after he kept pressing for an invasion of Cuba.\nLyman L Leminitzer\nHowever the general was not the only issue Kennedy had to deal with, it was the mindset of the government in a Post-Cold War era where communism had to be stopped at all costs. He was required to deal with a vast array of generals and top CIA executives who were willing to do whatever it took to put an end to the spread of Communism, and the acts of domestic terrorism was more than likely viewed as patriotic in their own minds, a necessary evil in order to prevent a greater one from emerging. The withdrawal of missiles from Turkey and Italy, a neutral policy on Laos, as well as the Test Ban treaty and deal with Russia to not invade Cuba were all construed by these individuals as a defeat for Capitalism and a victory for Communism. Kennedy\u2019s refusal to bow down to the Pentagon generals who needed wars to stay in business and to defeat \u201cthe enemy\u201d is cited by many as one of the reasons why he was assassinated.\nOperation Mongoose\nOperation Mongoose was a proposal similar to Operation Northwoods involving operations against communist Cuba. The plan outlined a proposal to create the appearance of an attack on U.S facilities in Cuba, framing it as the work of the Cuban government, called Operation Bingo. Operation Dirty Trick was also included within the Operation Mongoose Memorandum, which proposed blaming Cuba for the crash of the Mercury spacecraft in 1962. Operation Mongoose was proposed after Lyman L Leminitzer lost his job as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, by the Joint Chiefs.\nOther possible false flag attacks suggested was an attack on Nations friendly to the U.S, which would be framed as Cuban attacks and would give the U.S a platform for a Cuban invasion. Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago were included in the list of nations, with the hope that the U.K would also be drawn into a joint attack on Cuba. Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago were members of the British Commonwealth at the time. A US Department of Defense report went as far as to suggest paying a member of Castro\u2019s government to attack the U.S Navy base at Guantanamo.\n\u201cThe only area remaining for consideration then would be to bribe one of Castro\u2019s subordinate commanders to initiate an attack on [the U.S. Navy base at] Guantanamo\u201d\nConclusion\n\nThere is no ambiguity over Operation Northwoods. It contemplated direct attacks on American citizens and framing the Cubans in order to defeat the apparent threat of Communist interests. It is freely available information. There are official documentation and no reason to believe that it is not true when official sources say otherwise.\nIn 2001, the National Assembly of People\u2019s Power of Cuba (the main legislative body for Cuba) issued a statement referring to Operation Northwoods and Operation Mongoose wherein it condemned the actions of the U.S government.\nOperation Northwoods Documentaries\nOperation Northwoods QF-104 DRONEs 1961",

    "title": "Pan Am Flight 103",
    "content": "Pan Am Flight 103 was a scheduled flight from Frankfurt to Detroit. In December 1988 the plane was destroyed by a bomb, killing all 243 passengers.The explosion took place over Scotland after taking off from London, and thus Europe had jurisdiction over the explosion. In 1999 Two Lybian nationals were handed over by General Gadaffi (the then leader/dictator of Lybia) for trial in a Scottish court in the Netherlands. The bomb was said to have been made out of Semtex plastic. Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi was jailed for life in connection with the bombing, released by the Scottish government in 2009 on compassionate grounds due to a diagnosis of prostate cancer. There was a significant lack of protest in the wake of his release, suggesting that many of the family of the victims do not believe him to be behind the bombing. Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al-Megrahi died in 2012.\nAl Amin Khalifa Fhimah\nAl Amin Khalifa Fhimah, the other Libyan handed over for the case, was found not guilty. Gadaffi accepted responsibility for the bombings in 2003. The CIA and the FBI worked with intelligence officers in Europe when processing the case. Over 15,000 people were questioned in over 30 countries. The explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 is also known as the Lockerbie bombing.\nIt is almost certain that the Libyan convicted had little to do with the Lockerbie bombing and that the real players are unknown. Just about only thing that remains uncontested is that a bomb went off in a suitcase and killed 243 passengers and 16 crew members. In a Report on and evaluation of the Lockerbie trial conducted by the Special Scottish Court in the Netherlandat Kamp Van Zeist, Dr. Hans K\u00f6chler, University Professor, International Observer of the International Progress Organization stated that:\n\u201c It was a consistent pattern during the whole trial that \u2013 as an apparent result of political interests and considerations \u2013 efforts were undertaken to withhold substantial information from the Court. \u201c\nThe Opinion of the Court is exclusively based on circumstantial evidence and on a series of highly problematic inferences. As to the undersigned knowledge, there is not one single piece of material evidence linking the two accused to the crime.\nOn the basis of the above observations and evaluation, the undersigned has \u2013 to his great dismay \u2013 reached the conclusion that the trial, seen in its entirety, was not fair and was not conducted in an objective manner. Indeed, there are many more questions and doubts at the end of the trial than there were at its beginning\u201d\nConspiracy Theory #1 \u2013 Revenge\nOne theory contends that it was an act of revenge stemming from Iran. Over 290 passengers were killed when US forces shot down an Iran Airbus over the Strait of Hormuz, including over 66 children. This was less than 6 months before Pan Am Flight 103. Investigative reporter Paul Foot believes that this is the most likely scenario and that Libya was actually framed by the British and Americans, with political factors coming into play: Libya openly backed Saddam Hussein and Iran were needed during the first Gulf War. A number of journalists have drawn attention to the fact that Margaret Thatcher dismissed the idea in her memoirs that the Lockerbie bombing an act of Iranian revenge.\nConspiracy Theory #2 \u2013 CIA drug smuggling cover up\n\nNot the first and most definitely not the last link between the U.S Central Intelligence Agency and illegal substances. This theory is backed up through Lester Coleman, a former member of the U.S Drug Enforcement Agency. Allegedly there was a route of drug smuggling between the U.S and Europe through Syrian drug dealers, who were allowed keep the ring going in return for CIA intelligence. The agency managed to ensure that the suitcases were not checked so the regime could continue; however, the scheme backfired when a bomb was put into the suitcase instead of the narcotics. In the 1994 film \u201cThe Maltese Double Cross\u201d, it was suggested that the CIA agents were to blame for turning a blind eye to the drug smuggling ring between Europe and the US in return for information.\nConspiracy Theory #3 \u2013 Abu Nidal on behalf of Gadaffi\nAbu Nidal\nAbu Nidal was an internationally renowned terrorist around the time of the Lockerbie bombing. U.S bombings in 1986 killed large numbers of Libyan civilians and Gadaffi\u2019s response was to engage the services of Abu Nidal. Nidal moved his organization to Libya in 1987. It is also contended that Abu Nidal warned U.S intelligence that a flight on route to Detroit would be blown up. Abu Nidal allegedly confessed to the bombing on his deathbed. The former head of Iranian intelligence was reported to have told German intelligence that Iran asked Libya/Gaddafi and Abu Nidal for help in bombing the American airline. Part of that report states:\nThe mission was to blow up a Pan Am flight 103 that was to be almost entirely booked by US military personnel on Christmas leave. The flight was supposed to be a direct flight from Frankfurt, GE, to New York, not Pan Am Flight 103 which was routed through London, UK. The suitcase containing the bomb was labeled with the name of one of the US passengers on the plane and was inadvertently placed on the wrong plane possibly by airport ground crew members in Frankfurt. The terrorist who last handled the bomb was not a passenger on the flight.\nConspiracy Theory #4 \u2013 PFLP-GC & Pan Am Flight 103\nKhreesat\nIn the aftermath of the bombing, the prime suspects in the Lockerbie bombing were the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine\u2014General Command. These were a warlike revolutionary group led by a former Syrian military officer. Mohammed Abu Talb was the head of the Swedish cell of the PFLP-GC and was one of a number of suspects before the focus shifted to Al Megrahi. PFLP-GC had a bomb maker at their disposal who was meant to be investigated by Scottish police until the FBI persuaded them to call off the warrant for the purposes of intelligence information. Khreesat was a Jordanian intelligence officer unknown to the PFLP-GC and relayed intelligence back to HQ, which relayed it to Western Intelligence. Allegedly, Khreesat relayed information that there would be a bomb planted on a Pan Am flight in October 1988, around 6 months before the actual crash. German intelligence raided the PFLP-GC acting on this information but did not progress further with regard to the bombing.\nConspiracy Theory #5 \u2013 Bernt Carlsson & Apartheid South Africa\nBernt Carlsson\nA more recent theory emerged from Wikispooks editor and former British diplomat Patrick Haseldine suggesting that the Lockerbie bombing was a clandestine assassination attempt on Bernt Carlsson. Carlsson was the highest ranked official on the plane and was the chief administration officer of the United Nations Council for Namibia. Haseldine wrote to the Scottish police commissioner in May 2015 asking that an inquiry be launched into the murder of Bernt Carlsson. He was en route to New York in order to attend the signing ceremony of Namibian independence from South Africa, who were in violation of United Nations Resolution with an illegal occupation of Libya. When the Tripart Accords was signed by the South African Foreign Minister instead of the diseased Bernt Carlsson, control of Namibia was given to South-African attorney Louis Pienaar. An official delegation of 22 South African diplomats changed their flight reservations from Pan Am 103 at the last minute, including South African Minister Pik Botha.\nConclusion to the Pan Am Flight 103 Explosion\nIt is certain at this stage that the official story of a lone Libyan civilian conducting the bombing is false. He did not bring down Pan Am Flight 103 alone. However, no-one is any the wiser to what actually happened. There are simply too many conflicting theories, too many intelligence agencies, too many countries involved and too many variables to construct a credible theory as to what went on. Even the theories listed above tend to blend and mix together with different variants. It is possible that the PFLP-GC, Gadaffi and Abu Nidal all had a role in some fashion, but separating what happened exactly and who is responsible is just impossible. One theory is that Iran asked Libya/Gadaffi and Abu Nidal to bomb Pan Am 103 in revenge, a mixing of two theories. It gets more complex the more that it is investigated with all the difference information from the intelligence agencies and reports from investigative journalists.\n\nMost probable is theory number one as proposed by Paul Foot \u2013 US officials shot down an Iranian plane and the Iranians retaliated. And most unlikely is theory Five, whatever the links made and evidence proposed by Patrick Haseldine. To bomb an entire plane to get rid of a single diplomat just does not make sense or add up in any way. For the tens of millions spent over the years on investigations and related activities, surely there is a more efficient and subtle way of removing someone than bombing an entire plane?\nLockerbie Bombing Documentaries\nPan am flight 103 (Lockerbie Bombing) is one topic where you will find a lot of documentaries on. The very known ones are listed below.\nLockerbie Bombing\n\nLockerbie: The Pan Am bomber\n\nLockerbie: Case closed\n\nThe Lockerbie Bombing Documentary\n\nInside Story \u2013 Who was really behind the Lockerbie bombing?",

    "title": "Pearl Harbor",
    "content": "Pearl Harbor: Branches\nBetrayal at Pearl Harbor, Book by James Rusbridger & Eric Nave\nThere are two branches to the theory that Japan was allowed to attack Pearl Harbor so that America could assist the Allies against Germany. The first is that the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill knew about the assault in advance and told Roosevelt, but they both agreed to sit on the information, obviously having some sort of arrangement. The second theory is more prominent, in that Churchill knew of the attack but did not tell Roosevelt. The second limb of this theory was initially endorsed in the book \u201cBetrayal at Pearl Harbor\u201d. The book was written by James Rusbridger and Eric Nave in 1991. Nave had in fact broken the Japanese naval cipher in 1939 and Rusbridger was a former M16 intelligence officer. The backgrounds of these two co-authors gave the book much publicity and credence. The central claim of \u201cBetrayal at Pearl Harbor\u201d was that Britain had broken the Japanese codes and knew of the attack in advance.\nA recently published declassified Naval memo stated that:\n\u201cIn anticipation of possible open conflict with this country, Japan is vigorously utilizing every available agency to secure military, naval and commercial information, paying particular attention to the West Coast, the Panama Canal and the Territory of Hawaii\u201d\nIt also said that the Japan Naval Inspectors Office was\n\u201cprimarily interested in obtaining detailed technical information which could be used to advantage by the Japanese Navy.\u201d\nThis Naval Intelligence Memo was dated Dec 4, 1941. While this is quite damning evidence to the Pearl Harbor conspiracy, it is nowhere near concrete. Reports such as this might have been filtering in all the time, and it was unlikely that Japan would make a trip so far from their homeland and refuel before hitting Pearl Harbor. And the information does not give any specific strategic information such as time or location. The only thing that could be done was to put the whole West Coast on alert from \u201csome\u201d sort of attack, and all they knew was that Japan was gathering intelligence for some reason. Thus while theorists might state that this memo is proof that Roosevelt knew about the attack on Pearl Harbor, it represents no more than one of possibly hundreds of similar documents indicating some threat, at some location, at some time.\nDay of Deceit, A Book on Pearl Harbor\nAnother theory is that not only was Roosevelt aware of the attack, but actively had a hand in orchestrating it. He was known to have been sympathetic to the Allies but could not intervene because it would have gone against public sentiment to engage in a European war. Roosevelt was frequently quoted as saying that he would never put American soldiers into \u201cforeign wars\u201d. Tyler Kent, a code clerk in the US embassy in London, was alleged to have discovered secret dispatches between Roosevelt and Churchill which revealed that Roosevelt wanted to win the war along with England. Kent spent the majority of the war in jail after being caught trying to smuggle documents out of the embassy. Theorists also hold that America had done it\u2019s best under Roosevelt to try to provoke Germany into a war, by freezing German assets, shipping destroyers, and U-boats to Britain. World War II Veteran Robert B. Stinnett has published a book titled \u201cDay of Deceit: The Truth bout FDR and Pearl Harbor(2000)\u201d, which further investigates the role that Roosevelt apparently had in entering World War II via Japan. America treated Japan much as it did Germany, freezing its assets and closing the Panama Canal. Japan was known at that time to have been quite belligerent in any case and quite easy to provoke. Admiral J.O. Richardson did fly to Washington to protest the decision to station the naval base in Pearl Harbor, which was quite deemed indefensible for a variety of reasons, including that it was vulnerable in any direction, could not be effectively rigged with nets and lacked adequate fuel supplies and dry docks. He came away from the exchange with FDR and stated:\n\u201cI came away with the impression that, despite his spoken word, the President was fully determined to put the United States into the war if Great Britain could hold out until he was reelected\u201d \nPulitzer Prize winner John Toland has also provided evidence about advance knowledge of Pearl Harbour by Washington in his book \u201cInfamy: Pearl Harbor and Its Aftermath\u201d. \nPearl Harbor Day\nThe conclusion is that it is, in fact, possible that Churchill was aware of the invasion in advance and opted not to tell Roosevelt about it. We have good reasons as to why this intelligence would not be given, at a time when England stood to lose the war which would have shaped the future of world affairs to this day. The decision could have come down to a couple of thousand of American troops at Pearl Harbor or millions of English citizens. And we also have two highly authoritative whistleblowers. This is as much proof as you are going to get in the land of conspiracy theories, as no mainstream papers are going to report international treachery of this level. Some could even say it\u2019s simply good business to not inform America, and not in the interests of the British Empire at the time. However, Churchill could have simply given the information to Roosevelt in good faith, and it could have been spun in order to get the American people to take part in the campaign against Germany. The theory that Roosevelt knew about and helped the attack on Pearl Harbor is far less likely, though there have been multiple credible testimonies that Washington knew about the attack in advance.\nYou may also be interested in reading the September 11 Conspiracy \nDocumentaries and Related Videos\n1.

    "title": "Princess Diana Conspiracies",
    "content": "Princess Diana died a horrific death in 1997. She was a well-loved figure, well spoken and compassionate. Part of the British Royal family, she married the prince of Wales in 1981. She bore two sons with the Prince however they separated in 1996\u00a0and had both been seeing other people before the breakup. This was publicly revealed in 1992. She died in a car accident in Paris with the man she was seeing, the son of an Egyptian billionaire. Given the nature of the breakup coupled with her royal/political status, from her death there emerged a number of conspiracy theories. The cause of death was deemed to be because of the intoxication and resulting negligence of Henri Paul,\u00a0the driver, coupled with the negligence of the media following closely behind.\nPrincess Diana Death Conspiracy\n1. Faked Death\nOne of the more poorly constructed Conspiracy theories. Princess Diana, upset with the intrusions into her private life by the media, staged the whole thing to get some privacy. The evidence for this is that the bodyguard; Trevor Rees-Jones is still alive. However, it is impossible to survive a crash at a car traveling at such a high speed. Other evidence cited is that Diana\u2019s usual driver was not used but was changed at the last minute. On top of this, the Princess allegedly informed the Daily Mail two days before the incident that she was going to slip away from public life. This Princess Diana Conspiracy Theory seems very unlikely. To go to such an extreme length to escape from public life is insanity, and she would have to be in hiding for the rest of her life, not to mention she would most likely have to get some sort of disguise and plastic surgery. An offshoot of this theory is that it was supposed to be a fake crash which went horribly wrong resulting in the death of the popular Princess Diana.\n2. Killed by Secret Services\nRichard Tomlinson, Former MI6 Agent\nShe was killed by MI6. MI6 is the British equivalent of the CIA. It\u2019s the intelligence agency of the United Kingdom and deals with intelligence relating to international affairs, generally used to combat oversea\u2019s threats (i.e. foreign intelligence). The rationale behind this conspiracy theory is that Princess Diana is a threat the stability of the Empire, and has to be taken out. MI6 were accused of bugging Princess Diana on numerous occasions and were also claimed to have been behind the revelation of the tapes which led to her break up with Prince Charles. Her security guard who survived the car crash had extensive military training, and this is given as a reason linking him with MI6 and the death of Diana. One former MI6 operative, Richard Tomlinson, swore that MI6 were at the heart of the death of Diana and that they had been following her for some time beforehand. He later retracted that statement, saying he must have misremembered.\n3. It\u2019s just good business\nDodi Al Fayed\nOther theorists have claimed that the death of Princess Diana was caused by business rivals of Dodi\u2019s father, the Egyptian billionaire. The death of Diana would act as a smokescreen for their real intent to kill Dodi. This is an exceptionally thin conspiracy, killing a princess to avoid suspicion. In reality, this would simply draw the attention of special intelligence who would swiftly find the perpetrators. It would have been more intelligent to assassinate Dodi when he was not in the vehicle with an internationally known figure.\n4. The Burial Ground.\nOne theory alleges that Princess Diana was secretly cremated and interred at a chapel in the town of Great Brington. Officially she is buried in the Spencer family estate at Althorp. There does not seem to be an underlying rationale for the emergence of this theory.\nOther Conspiracies\n\nSome say it was the Royal family who were simply unhappy at Diana\u2019s behavior and taught her a permanent lesson. Dodi Fayed was not a Christian and it apparently would not do to bring an outsider into the Royal family. He was allegedly going to propose to Diana on the trip, said to have purchased a ring from a jewelry store beforehand. This was backed up by Mohamed Al-Fayed, Dodi\u2019s father. It was also claimed that Diana was pregnant when the car crashed, another reason the Royal Family might not have been best pleased. The Coroner who carried out the postmortem examination claimed that this was not true.\n\nA British inquest in 2007 found the crash to be the result of extremely negligent driving by the driver of the Mercedes and of the paparazzi following behind. It is plausible that she told the driver to lose the media which contributed to the crash in Pont de l\u2019Alma tunnel. Dodi\u2019s father publicly accused Prince Philip of plotting the murder of the couple at the 2007 inquest. He also claimed that a White Fiat Uno caused the car to swerve and crash, stating that the owner of the Fiat Uno was a security services agent who had photographed Diana while at his villa. This security services agent provided documentary evidence about his movements on the date of the crash to French police, demonstrating that he could only have been at his home.\nDocumentaries and Related Videos\nHere are some of the documentaries about Princess Diana\u2019s death and interesting facts surrounding the incident.\n1.

    "title": "Sandy Hook Massacre",
    "content": "On the 14th December 2012, Adam Lanza killed his mother before traveling to the Sandy Hook Elementary School and murdering 20 children between the ages of 6 and 7. Seven adults also lost their lives while facing down the wrong end of an AR-15 rifle. He then shot himself before the police arrived on the scene. The shooting provoked much debate over key political issues after it\u2019s occurrence, mainly around gun control in the United States. The official report indicated that Lanza acted alone in the shooting. No evidence was provided as to why he did what he did.\nUS Government involvement\nA number of theorists have contended that the incident was a hoax by the United States Government. Talk show host Clyde Lewis wrote:\n\u201cDon\u2019t you find it at all interesting that Adam Lanza, the alleged shooter at Sandy Hook, woke up one day and decided to shoot up a school and kill children at about the same time that Barack Obama told the U.N. that he would sign the small arms treaty?\u201d \n\nSome allege that the motivation behind the \u201choax\u201d was to push stricter gun control laws and to take guns away from survivalists. Many pro-gun owners believe they have a right to guns and that the government is trying to disarm the populace so they may be controlled more easily. Many of these individuals are theorists who believe that there is an oncoming economic collapse and that when it arrives guns will be paramount to survival.\nA step too far\nA number of Sandy Hook theorists believe that no attack took place. One individual believed that the whole event had been staged by the New World Order and videotaped footage of the town where the incident occurred. A Florida University Professor wrote an article expressing doubts as to whether or not the incident happened at all. He was later investigated by his University and was on tenure at the time. The professor taught a class on conspiracy theories.\nJames Tracy\nThe professor, James Tracy, has since withdrawn his allegation about the shooting. Republican candidate Tom Ready even questioned whether or not it happened during a debate, and later apologized for his remarks.\nA week after the massacre a Youtube video emerged titled \u201cThe Sandy Hook Shooting \u2013 Fully Exposed\u201d, asking questions which implied that the shooting was a fake. State officials received phone calls asking questions about the shooting, and even the families of victims have been practically harassed, told that their children never existed and that it was all a government conspiracy. Online accounts of the parents of the murdered children were targeted in comments shortly after the incident. While most American\u2019s actually do believe in conspiracy theories in one form of another, it is rare to see them unified on a single issue with such little evidence. Alex Jones, the producer of Conspiracy hub infowars.com, claims that the Sandy Hook massacre was \u201csynthetic\u201d and \u201cmanufactured\u201d. He did temper it by stating;\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t know what the truth is. All I know is the official story of Sandy Hook has more holes in it than Swiss cheese.\u201d\nJones lost some credibility after stating multiple times that the Sandy Hook Shooting was a hoax and then retracting his statement by saying his statements were taken out of context and that he never actually called the shooting a hoax.\nThe father of a child murdered in the massacre set up an organization which takes legal action against theorists who claim that the incident never occurred or who needlessly harass victims of the tragedy. Two people have received jail sentences for harassment of Sandy Hook victims.\nIt was the Jews\nAnother theory holds that the attack came about as a result of Israeli Death Squads. This was a perceived act of revenge due to Obama\u2019s nomination of an Israeli critic to the position of US Secretary of Defense. Max Fisher debunked this as weak rhetoric with obvious logical fallacies, noting that the same author who initially proposed this theory also believed that Israel had been accountable for the 2011 Norway attacks. James H Fetzer also said that the attack was conducted by agents of Israel. The same individual also denies the Holocaust. Most theories which suggest Israeli or Jewish involvement contain significant elements of antisemitism.\nOther Theories\nA number of conspiracy theories hold that Lanza did not act alone. Fox News anchor Ben Swann suggested that another shooter accompanied Lanza. He said the same about the Aurora shooting and the Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting. Some allege that there were as many as four shooters.\nConnecticut crime statistics shows that no murders occurred in 2012. Infowars.com/Alex Jones took this as an admission by the FBI that no murders took place in the area at the time in thew town of Newtown, where the Sandy Hook incident took place. They are accounted for under \u201cState Police misc\u201d as opposed for Newtown murders, as the State Police were the primary investigators.\nReferences are made to the fact that Suzanne Collins, author of the Hunger Games, lives in Sandy Hook and in her novel 22 children are killed. The theorists refer to this as predictive programming.\nOther theories include:\n\nThe school was closed years before the shooting\nThere is footage of the kids leaving the building before the shooting\nThere is footage leaving the building after the shooting\nNo emergency helicopters were launched in response to the shooting\n\n\nSandy Hook Conclusion\nThere can be no doubt that the massacre took place. There is no evidence whatsoever that there was any element of foul play in Sandy Hook. Much more dangerous than any government conspiracy is a group of individuals frustrated in other areas of their lives and channeling it into poorly constructed, semi-coherent and outright ridiculous Conspiracy theories.\nDocumentaries\nThere are numerous professional and amateur\u00a0documentaries about Sandy Hook out there.\u00a0Below is a short one you might find interesting.\nThe Sandy Hook Shooting \u2013 Fully Exposed",

    "content": "Let\u2019s take a look into the folded bills theories a little deeper.\nThe 20 Dollar Bill Conspiracy\nUnsure of the exact origins of this theory, but in 2002 this started popping up in chatrooms and websites across the Internet. The science behind the 20 dollar bill 911 conspiracy is that when folded a certain way, the U.S. twenty dollar bill will form the twin towers on money. Many theorists suggest that this was a sign by \u00a0United States government or that it came from a higher power foreshadowing these horrific events.\u00a0\u00a0 At Conspiracies.net, we do not judge the theories presented; we just choose to present them and let the reader make their own decisions based on the information. Follow this tutorial below and see for yourself, make sure you use an old $20 bill.\nStep 1 \u2013 Fold the bill this way\n20 dollar bill twin towers\nStep 2 \u2013 Next,\u00a0 fold the bill this way\nMake sure that you fold exactly like the picture.\nThen fold like this\nStep 3 \u2013 Fold the right side under the same way that you folded the left side\nIn this picture is the Pentagon on fire as some theorists claim. Check the red circle below to see the alleged 20 dollar bill conspiracy that is the Pentagon ablaze.\nStep 3 \u2013 Fold the other side the same way\nStep 4 \u2013 Flip your bill\nSome people believe that you see a replica of the twin towers after both of the original airplanes struck the towers and before they toppled to the ground.\nThen we have the $20 bill showing 911\nMore Alleged Proof of the Twin Towers on money in the $5 and $10 bill. See below.\nThe 5 Dollar Bill Conspiracy \nThe picture below is of the $5 bill folded the exact same way that the 20 dollar twin towers bill was folded. While the 20 bill twin towers shows the towers after the two planes crashed into the buildings, the $5 conspiracy theory is that it shows both the World Trade Center and the Pentagon BEFORE the attack.\n5 Dollar Bill \u2013 Twin Towers\nThe 10 Dollar Bill Conspiracy\nThe $10 money focuses on the building in front of the Twin Towers, as seen in the picture below.\n$10 bill folded and showing twin towers again\u2026\nThe 50 Dollar Bill Conspiracy\nWhat is on the $50 Bill according to theorists? Check out the picture comparison below of the crumbling of one of the Towers to the $50 twin towers picture. According to those who follow these alleged 911 theories.\n$50 bill folded \u2013 crumbling of one of the Twin Towers\nThe 100 Dollar Bill Conspiracy\nLast but not least among the conspiracy group is the 100 dollar bill conspiracy that depicts the memorable scene of the smoking tower after the initial collapse. While this is not as a common theory as the 20 dollar bill 911 theory, it still has been linked to these horrible attacks.\u00a0 Check out the comparison below.\n100 dollar bill conspiracy\n\nAdditional\u00a0 9/11 Theories\nBesides the folding of the various bills to match the foreshadowing of the most tragic day in the United States history, there are several other theories that have been thrown around over the years that accompany the 911 money theories. Here are a few of the most common ones.\n\nThe one dollar bill theory, if folded the same as the 20 dollar bill forms a picture of an eagle with its head and wings cut off and upside down. The pyramid on the bottom is a representation of the New World Order or Novus Ordo Seclorum.\nWhen looking at the 20 dollar bill Pentagon side, the bill when folded has 5 sides which match up with the Pentagon.\nAnother 911 money theory is that on the side with the World Trade Center, if the two sides are folded together. You will notice the word American and one side and the word United on the other side. These folded symbols together are the two airlines that crashed into the Twin Towers, American and United.\n\nOverall 9/11 conspiracies are the most talked about and discussed of all conspiracies of all-time. Whether it is the twin towers on money or it is the \u201cinside government job\u201d, theorists from almost every angle have presented arguments on these theories.\nRelated Videos\n\nYou have read Twin Towers Conspiracy on Money would you like to read about the actual incident?

    "title": "Shakespeare",
    "content": "William Shakespeare\nThe Shakespeare conspiracy theories revolve around the idea that Shakespeare himself did not write any plays. Most of them make reference to the fact that Shakespeare grew up in a poor, backward town of Stratford upon Avon, had no education and money, yet his plays revealed much of courtly and foreign affairs, including aristocratic sports such as hunting, fowling and tennis, and descriptions of courtly life in intimate detail. There is no documentation of Shakespeare attending any educational facility. No letters or signed documents of Shakespeare exist. His surname was actually written differently on literary and nonliterary documents \u2013 Shakespear, Shake Spear, ShakesSpeares, Shake-Spear, etc. The language used in Shakespeare\u2019s will is unpoetic and makes no reference to personal works or essays. And All other members of William\u2019s family were illiterate.\n\u201c So far as anybody actually knows and can prove, Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon never wrote a play in his life. \u201d \u2013 Mark Twain\n1. Sir Francis Bacon\nSir Francis Bacon\nIs Shakespeare, Bacon? There is a theory going around that the plays attributed to Shakespeare were actually written by Sir Francis Bacon. Bacon was a philosopher, essayist, and scientist and has been called the founding father of empiricism, that scientific knowledge should be based on observations deduced from external events. This eventually led to the scientific method for approaching and solving problems in today\u2019s world. Various ideas are given with regards as to why Bacon would have wanted Shakespeare to take over as a front for his plays. Some suggest that at the time being a playwright was not seen as noble or artistic and would have hindered Bacon\u2019s political and scientific career. The theory is based on the fact that many ideas appear in both Bacon\u2019s writing and Shakespeare\u2019s plays. Some even claim that memoirs and biographies allude to the fact that the plays of Shakespeare were in fact produced by Bacon. However, academics generally reject this theory.\nThe \u201cBaconian Theory\u201d is not a modern one, but actually originated in the 19th Century. The theory was first published in a 16-page pamphlet called \u201cWas Lord Bacon the Author of Shakespeare\u2019s plays\u201d, written by William Henry Smith in 1856. The pamphlet suggested that letters between Shakespeare and Bacon hinted that Bacon might be the actual author of the works. The theory took off from here, with other writers such as Delia Bacon, John Bruce and Mary Fearon propagating the idea that Bacon was the original producer.\nShakespeare Conspiracy & Baconian Cryptology\nIn 1880 US Congressman Ignatius L. Donnelly started the Baconian Cryptology theory. He argued that Bacon revealed his authorship of Shakespeare\u2019s plays through means of hidden ciphers within the text. This was the start of much cipher theory in relation to Francis Bacon and William Shakespeare. Orville Ward Owen published a new book titled Sir Francis Bacon\u2019s Cipher Story in 1893, which claimed that Bacon was Queen Elizabeth\u2019s son, information hidden by means of a cipher in the works of Bacon/Shakespeare. Elizabeth Gallup built on Owen\u2019s work, arguing for a bilateral cipher, agreeing with Owen that Bacon was indeed the son of Queen Elizabeth. Many other writers took up the cipher theory, including Alfred Dodd and C.Y.C Dawbarn. In 1916 a court judge effectively ruled that ciphers identified by Elizabeth Gallup did, in fact, reveal Bacon to be the author of the Shakespearean Canon. However, In 1957 William and Elizabeth Freidman, two expert cryptologists, undertook a study of all the proposed ciphers combined and arrived at the conclusion that there was no hidden message in the works of Shakespeare by means of a Cipher. None of the Ciphers claimed to exist by the Baconians were valid.\n2. Edward De Vere\nEdward De Vere\nThis theory is known as the Oxfordian Theory of Shakespeare authorship, contending that it was, in fact, Edmund de Vere who wrote the plays of Shakespeare. De Vere was the 17th Earl of Oxford. The rationale behind the theory is that Shakespeare is a pseudonym for De Vere to operate under, as at the time aristocrats did not generally publish plays or poems and also to escape the consequences of the subject matter discussed. De Vere is rumored to have been nicknamed \u201cSpear Shaker\u201d at court and lived in the same district as Shakespeare. Shakespeare wrote a total of 37 plays and 134 sonnets.\nThe Oxfordian Theory is not well developed, with very little evidence to back it up. De Vere has mentioned in Delia Bacon\u2019s book The Philosophy of Shakespeare\u2019s plays unfolded, as a high born poet, and Oxfordians believe this is enough to justify De Vere\u2019s inclusion in the Shakespearean author committee mentioned in the book. The Oxford theory soon took over the Baconian theory. This was mainly due to the book Shakespeare Identified in Edward de Vere, (De Vere being the 17th Earl of Oxford) written by Thomas Looney. Looney made reference to the fact that the characters in the plays were not a match to the personality of Shakespeare. For example, the hero\u2019s of the plays were often free spending figures, whereas Shakespeare was identified as someone who took acute care of his finances. Looney concluded that the characters and ideas in the works of Shakespeare were much more suited to the disposition of the Earl of Oxford. Despite the lack of evidence or rationality, many were onboard with the Oxfordian theory. Sigmund Freud, Marjorie Bowen, and many 20th century celebrities all subscribed to the Oxfordian theory of Shakespearean authorship. It soon took over in popularity from the Baconian theory. Interpreting plays as autobiographical and then deducing the author from this interpretation is a method seen by the vast majority of literary specialists as unreliable. One of the major issues with the Oxfordian theory is that De Vere actually died in 1604 before 12 Shakespearean plays were actually composed. The Oxfordian response to this is that the dating of the plays is not accurate. In The Shakespeare Claimants, a 1962 examination of the authorship question, H. N. Gibson concluded that \u201c. . . on analysis, the Oxfordian case appears to me a very weak one\u201d Oxfordians have also tried to attribute many Non-Shakespearean works to Edmund De Vere.\nThe Oxfordian theory traveled all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States. In 1987 three-justice of the Supreme Court took a one-day moot trial to hear the case. The burden of proof was on the Oxfordians to prove that De Vere was, in fact, the author of Shakespeare. Literary experts were not represented. The judges concluded that the Oxfordian theory was based on a conspiracy theory, one which typically relies on a group of people colluding together in such a way that the proof cannot be obtained. They also concluded that the reasons given for the theory were incoherent and unpersuasive. A repeat of the case took place in England in 1988, and the High Lords of the UK confirmed the American verdict.\n3. Christopher Marlowe\nChristopher Marlowe\nThe Marlovian theory of Shakespearean ownership indicates that Christopher Marlowe did not actually die but faked his own death and wrote his works under the pseudonym, William Shakespeare. There is evidence as to why he would actually fake his own death. At the time he was accused of converting a number of people to atheism, and this was a serious offense guaranteed to result in execution. The first time the name of Shakespeare was associated with a literary piece occurred two weeks after the death of Marlowe. And it is accepted that Marlowe had friends in high places who could have arranged the faked death. And there are anomalies surrounding the death of Christopher Marlowe. Thus we have a theory which \u201cfits\u201d the bill but without any evidence supporting it.\nThe arguments against the Marlovian theory is that 16 jurors accepted the death of Christopher Marlowe as genuine and that there is no evidence of him after his death in 1593. Like all theories associated with the works of Shakespeare, there is no historical or academic record that evidences that Marlowe completed any of the works of Shakespeare. And while there is some similarity in their works, many have commented on the fact that Marlowe\u2019s style, humor, weakness, strengths, and vocabulary are completely different from Shakespeare\u2019s. The Marlovian theory was started initially in 1892 by T.W. White, followed up with a book by Willian Zeigler called It was Marlowe: a story of the secret of three centuries. There have since been many other books and essays promoting the Marlovian theory of Shakespearean authorship. In 2009 the International Marlowe-Shakespeare Society was founded.\nThe theory is like the others, considered fringe theories and highly unlikely. There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that his death was faked. The only reason to believe it was faked is that he wrote Shakespeare. Therefore his death must have been faked, known as circular reasoning.\nIn quite an interesting progression, Oxford University Press have actually named Christopher Marlowe as a co-author for the three Henry VII Shakespearean plays. The method used for deducing authorship was by analyzing every word of each play and looking for patterns and clues. Mathematicians are involved in the process. However, this addition does not settle the question of Shakespearean authorship. Just because Oxford University Press puts their brand on a name does not prove anything significant, and as Shakespearean professor at the University of Warwick Carol Rutter states\n\u201cIt will still be open for people to make up their own minds. I don\u2019t think [Oxford University Press] putting their brand mark on an attribution settles the issue for most people .. I believe Shakespeare collaborated with all kinds of people, but I don\u2019t believe Marlowe was one of them\u201d \n4. Other Candidates of\u00a0Shakespeare Conspiracy\nThere are numerous other candidates for Shakespearean authorship such as Roger Manners, the Fifth Earl of Rutland. While put forward in 1907 by Karl Bleibtreu, the theory did not have the same following as the Marlovian, Oxfordian or Baconian theories of Shakespearean ownership. James Greenstreet put forward William Stanley, the Sixth Earl of Derby, as a candidate in 1891. A minor variant of the Oxford theory is the Prince Tudor Theory, which has received less attention, where De Vere is a literary genius who becomes the lover of Queen Elizabeth.\nConclusion\nThe theories that are contended have no basis in reality. Much is speculation from literary artists, who argue that the characters in the plays of Shakespeare do not fit with the personality of Shakespeare. This is obviously a very shaky branch to hang a theory off of, as it is entirely subjective and not at all verifiable. There is no concrete evidence to imply that anyone other that Shakespeare wrote his own works.\nWilliam Shakespeare Statue\nPractically all academic documentation of the type commonly believed to be the founding piece of evidence for the authorship of a literary work points to Shakespeare being the owner of his own plays. This includes title pages, testimonies from other poets and historians as well as official records. Many notable poets at the time described Shakespeare as an excellent poet \u201cand of honest, and of an open, and free nature; had an excellent fancy; brave notions, and gentle expressions\u201d [Ben Johnson, playwright, and poet]. The earlier quote from Mark Twain is actually false. By all conventional standards of proof, we can prove that Shakespeare is, in fact, the author of Shakespeare. It is up to the theorists to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Shakespeare was not the author of Shakespeare, which they were unable to do in two court cases of independent judges well versed in logic and reasoning.\nHowever, the theorists contend that these documents are falsified, leaving the theory in the irreconcilable position where nothing can be proven. Much of the theories stem from the class division, with many of the wealthy aristocratic class unable to accept that a literary genius named William Shakespeare grew up in a poor and backward district and could write exceptionally well without being educated in an establishment such as Oxford.\nDocumentaries and Related Videos\n1.

    "title": "The 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami",
    "content": "On December 26, 2004, an undersea earthquake triggered a Tsunami which devastated South-East Asia. The Earthquake measured 9.0 on the Richter scale with an epicenter of 160 kilometers. It was the third largest Tsunami ever recorded on a Seismograph. The Tsunami arrived over two hours after the earthquake hit, which suggests that the earthquake must have triggered something else which led to the Tsunami. It was judged to be the 10th worst natural disaster of all time. The country hardest hit was Indonesia, with the region known as Aceh taking the brunt of the waves and left completely destroyed.\nIt was the fourth largest Earthquake in the past hundred years. Tsunamis generated via Earthquakes are not uncommon. However, this tsunami was particularly large. The unfortunate fact about the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami is that a simple warning system of floated buoys would have saved thousands of lives. Such a system is implemented in the U.S.A. The \u201cTsunameters\u201d used to detect Tsunami\u2019s cost only $250,000 each, and only one is necessary with another as a backup. The Indian government lacked the funding to purchase them. Over 200,000 people died as a result of the Tsunami. Over eleven million were displaced.\nPrimary Conspiracy\nThe primary Conspiracy in relation to the The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami is that it was caused by underground Nuclear tests conducted by the United States. Underground nuclear testing is common, indeed practically the only place where tests of such nature can take place. And these can result in adverse consequences for land masses. Australian Research Joe Vialls wrote an inflammatory article titled \u201cDid New York Orchestrate The Asian Tsunami?\u201d outlining how simple it would be to trigger a nuclear bomb at the bottom of the ocean. Egyptian weekly magazine\u00a0Al-Osboa claimed that the Tsunami was triggered by Indian Nuclear testing which a team of American nuclear engineers participated.\nIn a European case brought against the French government (Case T-219/95 R ) it was found that:\n\u201cSince the geology of Mururoa is already unstable due to large-scale fracturing caused by previous tests, further major landslides are likely. Such landslides in the past have given rise to tsunamis causing coastal damage in areas as far away as Pitcairn and Tahiti and endangering residences such as that of Ms. Danielsson. They can also release radioactive material into the sea, with catastrophic effects on the food chain in an area such as French Polynesia where fish is an important part of the diet\u201d\nHowever, the idea that nuclear testing results in Tsunamis are new and under-researched. No atomic bomb was at the time strong enough to cause a tsunami of that stature. And no bomb is strong enough at the present time to generate a Tsunami wave. The energy required would be enormous. But it is possible that it would trigger an Earthquake which would lead to a Tsunami.\n\nThe strongest bomb ever denoted was known as the Tsar Bomba. This hydrogen bomb devastated everything around it for 22 miles. It yielded 50 megatons of energy. In 2011 a Japanese earthquake created massive waves off the coast of Japan that resulted in a nuclear meltdown. 480 megatons of energy were released. And even in the investigations that were completed by the US administration into the effect of bombs on Tsunamis and Earthquake, they could not replicate anything near a large wave. In other words, even if the US government were evil and somehow wanted to send a Tsunami towards India, they would not have the capacity to do so. The idea is somewhat ridiculous and there is no evidence to support it.\nOther Indian Ocean Tsunami Conspiracy theories\nThere are the more standard theories associated with the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. One is that the Tsunami was caused by Reptiles who wanted to destabilize the Earth. Even by Reptile theorist standards, this is quite a poor effort at logic or reason. Other\u2019s say that both the Indian and American government worked together to trigger to cause the Earthquake. It has also been claimed that the U.S government knew ahead of time that the Tsunami was underway due to their Tsunami sensors, yet failed to warn the Asians. And still, others say that the Australian and Thai governments failed to respond to the warning from the US about the earthquake. There is no evidence to back up any of these claims.\nConclusion\n\nIt is possible that a nuclear explosion could cause an earthquake which would result in a Tsunami. The problem with this theory, and with most other conspiracy theories, is that there is simply no evidence whatsoever to suggest that the USA were testing nuclear weapons at the time. And if there was, then a link between the nuclear testing and the earthquake and the Tsunami would have to be established. This theory has no documentary evidence supporting it, no testimonies, no motive, no prior record, and no rationale. As it stands, it is simply conjectured and joins billions of other theories that \u201ccould\u201d be true but until it comes up with some evidence it\u2019s best to assume it false.\nAvailable Documentaries\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any professional conspiracy documentaries about 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. However, there are documentaries about the incident itself, which may help the readers see the reality one bit.",

    "title": "Peak Oil Conspiracies",
    "content": "The Peak Oil Conspiracy traces its roots back to geologist Marion King Hubbert back in 1956. He presented a paper indicating that any finite resource must have a beginning, middle and end of production and must reach a point of maximum output followed by a decline. Thus technology will keep improving to extract oil at a faster rate which must eventually reach a point of decline. He accurately predicted a decline in oil in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s which marked him as the first to bring the problem of peak oil to public attention. The term \u201cpeak oil\u201d refers to the maximum production of oil, not to the falling supply of oil.\nThe Oil Overview\nNikola Tesla\nMany allege that inventor Nicola Tesla developed an alternative form of energy to Oil called Free Energy over a hundred years ago, but that this discovery was covered up by oil baron John D Rockefeller. Thus this form of energy faded away. However, there is no evidence that such an energy source actually exists and it is unreasonable to suggest that it does give no scientist has since been able to find a basis or even create any working models. Thus nothing at the present moment can replace oil.\nThe world today runs on oil. And should we reach a point of peak oil then it would result in a crisis? Many contend that should we reach this point then the free market will solve the problem, as more resources are turned towards discovery alternative forms of energy and different ways of doing things the solution will be found. And this does have the basis in fact. However what is missing is the length of time this would take to implement along with the scale of implementation. It would take many years to get it right while people need to utilize transport to get to work and for all industrialize factories to make products which are needed worldwide. Thus the adjustment period could get problematic in terms of production and distribution of needed produce. Similar to global warming, where it is not the fact that the world is heating up but the speed at which it\u2019s heating up, the speed at which we run out of oil will be a determining factor in terms of the economic fallout. In a general sense, it is quite obvious that a decline in the supply of something so intrinsic to the modern economy would have adverse economic consequences. However, there are a number of peak oil conspiracies which contend with some of the assumptions of peak oil, which are outlined below.\n1. Peak Oil invented by Oil Industries\nThe main peak oil conspiracy put forward is that there is no shortage of Oil and that artificial demand is created by the oil barons. The oil companies are aware of peak oil but does not utilize additional reservoirs because it needs to maintain the illusion of scarcity. If there is a perceived shortage of oil, then prices can shoot through the roof, as has happened historically. It is true that a decrease in supply will result in an increase in price and therefore more money for oil producers who hold oil. And it would be in their interest for the prices of oil to go up.\n\nHowever this is not to say that the Oil Industries somehow have all scientists, geologists and the world at large completely fooled by fabricating the message that oil supplies are running out, in much the same way that Climate Change is not a giant hoax pulled off by the environmental energy sector. Such claims need evidence to back them up, of which there is little. Further, it would take a collusion of all oil barons involved, which is unlikely.\n2. Oil is Renewable\nLittle credence can be given to this theory. Oil is not renewable in any way. It has been proven beyond reasonable doubt that oil is biotic in origin and nonrenewable. And the point would be moot in any case. We are using oil faster than it would be replenished leaving the world in the same position with regard to peak oil \u2013 Needing to find an alternative energy source.\n3. Renewable Energy Sources have been suppressed\nThere are many who contend that alternative energy sources are alive and well and actively suppressed, in order for the energy industries to maintain their monopoly. The energy sector is huge, and should an alternative energy source be developed it will end a lot of multi-billion dollar industries. All appliances run on energy. All cars run on energy. All manufacturing runs on energy. There is tremendous wealth in the oil industry. Thus should a renewable device be developed which powers your house, car and everything else, it would definitely be a crippling blow to a variety of monopolies and a massive plus to ordinary citizens, as energy would be more or less free. There are a number of cases which involve inventors working on renewable energy sources and who have met stiff opposition from the energy industries including:\n\nAl Wordsworth: Electrical Generator and Advanced Carburetor\nMike Brady: Perendev 300 kW Self-Running Electromagnetic Generator\nRobert Stewart: Stewart Cycle Heat Engine\nGary Vesperman (Reporter): CIA Agents at 1996 Tesla Society Symposium 8 Stewart Harris: Theory of Magnetic\nInstability 8 Ron Brandt:\nRichard Diggs: Liquid Electricity Engine\nGianni A. Dotto: Anti-Aging and Anti-Gravity Thermionic Couple\nWilliam Bolon: Automobile Steam Engine\n\nBill Williams: Joe Cell Technology\n\u201cThe driver stated that they wanted me to stop working on all forms of alternative energy. He also stated that we know everything about me, my family, and all my projects past and present.\nAt about that time the passenger reached and held up a file that was about 2 or so inches thick. He opened it up and showed me telephone transcripts, emails, messages from the groups that I had belonged to.\nThey knew where my kids worked, the times they are at work; also my wife\u2019s working hours, my grandkids\u2019 school, etc. They knew everything.\nThe driver said that if I did not stop working on this (he then opened up the left side of his jacket and showed his weapon that was holstered) that there would be other consequences.\nHe also stated that he wanted me to post that I was no longer working in this field and to destroy all my work, i.e. Cells, Drawings, Lab Journals, everything!\nAt that point he walked around and got into the rig. I shut the hood and got the hell out of there. They followed me for about 2 miles and then must have turned off somewhere.\u201d\nThe details of these and more renewable energy cases are available online (unverified). Reports include cutting of research funding, harassment, murder, threats of bodily harm and damage to the family, blackmail, phone tapping, destruction to property and research facilities and suppression of findings. Oil companies are well known for purchasing patents for inventions which propose to increase fuel efficiency. The inventions are then left unused by the Oil Industry. In many other cases, the company is bought outright. The film documentary Who Killed the Electric Car? Investigates the suppression of the Electric car in the U.S. The film investigates how the automobile manufacturers, the oil industry and the Bush Administration collaborated to kill off the Electric car before it took off, and questions the logic of destroying all models of electric car. Unless they are reintroduced in such a way that the oil and manufacturing industries can make a profit off of we will not see the introduction of either a new energy form or electric car of any kind.\nThe initial \u201ccase\u201d of suppression of renewable energy would be the illegal possession and subsequent destruction of the works of Nikola Tesla immediately after his death. Some theorists also contend that J.F.K was assassinated due to his promotion of renewable energy, linked in particular to the Passamaquoddy renewable energy project and other investigations into sources of coastal energy as an alternative to the burning of fossil fuels. The Peak Oil Conspiracy naturally evolves to the free energy Suppression theory when taken towards it\u2019s ultimate conclusion. The free energy Suppression Theory indicates that should a renewable energy device be created then nobody would have to pay for anything and the Capitalist system would collapse. This concept was explored in the works of Iain M. Banks and is even found in Star Trek. However it is utopian and idealistic in nature and far removed from where we are today. It would result in a vastly changed way of doing things, but it would be illogical to suggest that it would lead to a collapse of the capitalist system. There would still have to be a medium of exchange for goods and services.\nHowever, Peak Oil conspiracy Three is gaining traction and will continue to grow as more and more people look into alternative energy. The suppression of alternative forms of energy has been by far the largest, and most accurate theory proposed by theorists. It is more important than any theory about debt, moon landings or absurd Alien Reptile conspiracy claims. The suppression of alternative forms of energy has had more of an effect on the financial, mental and emotional well-being of humanity than any other single factor.\nConclusion\nIt would seem on the face of it that the win is for human ingenuity and the free market. Marion King Hubbert was actually correct in his initial prediction of peak oil in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s \u2013 until the successful application of massive hydraulic fracturing to existing U.S reservoirs. He was correct based on the data/known variables at the time. And new reserves are being discovered all the time. The ultimate failure with every projection is that it is a projection upon which not all variables are known.\nThus current estimates indicate that oil will run out in the future. However, it cannot take into account how many oil reserves will be found or how technology that will be inevitably created will resolve current issues. Any equation or projection can only take into account known variables, and it is unknown variables that often have the greatest effect \u2013 such as the internet, bitcoins or other unknown disruptions. Also of note is that in 1919 U.S chief geologist David White indicated that with regard to petroleum\n\u201cthe peak of production will soon be passed, possibly within 3 years\u201d. \nAnd In 1953, Eugene Ayers, a researcher for Gulf Oil, projected that production in the US would peak no later than 1960. In conclusion there is no need to worry about peak oil. It is not that there is a peak oil conspiracy, it\u2019s just that that there are unknown variables, humans are highly inventive and 99% of all predictions and projections have been incorrect, and always have will be. With regard to the suppression of free energy, it is just a matter of time before awareness is generated and the monopolies can stem the tide of the invention no more.\nDocumentaries\nPeak Oil",

    "title": "The Philadelphia Experiment",
    "content": "The Philadelphia Experiment Theory\nThe theory began with a letter from an individual supposedly on board the destroyer, the USS\u00a0Eldridge\u00a0(DE-173), named Carlos Allende. He claimed that The Eldridge disappeared and reappeared in front of him, and then linked this occurrence to Einstein\u2019s Unified Field Theory.\nThe scientific rationale behind the theory is that invisibility is possible using on the basis of Unified Field Theory, a class of theories describing the interrelated nature of electromagnetic and gravitational forces. Electrical Generators would bend light around large objects via refraction, rendering it invisible. Being a useful technique to have the Navy allegedly undertook the Philadelphia Experiment in 1943. There are few reliable accounts and testimonies.\nThere are a number of different variants as to what actually happened with the apparent disappearance of the USS Eldridge. Some say that the destroyer was rendered almost completely invisible, others that it was covered with greenish fog. Sailors are reported to have gone insane with one account indicating that a sailor\u2019s hand got trapped within the ship when it reappeared. The bodies of the sailors were still on the ship when it went invisible, and sailors were reported to have been nauseous after the event. After the negative response from the sailors the experiment was stopped by the Navy. The Experiment did not go as planned due to the failure to properly calibrate all the equipment. There are many claims of adverse side effects on crew member such as some being turned inside out, disappearing and reappearing, begin nauseous, suffering from serious mental illnesses and subjected to brainwashing in order to keep the experiment a secret.\nAnother offshoot of the Philadelphia Experiment theory was that the Navy tried to repeat the experiment later on in the year with more success. In this report, the USS Eldridge actually teleported itself over 300 Kilometers away to Norfolk, Virginia, where it remained for a few minutes. Sailors aboard another destroyer, the SS\u00a0Andrew Furuseth, viewed the Eldridge for a few minutes before it teleported itself back to Philadelphia.\nAlien Contact\nIn\u00a01955 a book was published titled The Case for the UFO, linking theories about how UFO\u2019s might fly with Unified Field Theory. The book was written by an astronomer, Morris K Jessup.\nMorris K Jessup, Astronomer\nThis book has resurfaced in significance with the modern writings of James Moseley and Karl Pflock in 2002, who claim that Jessup was contacted by Aliens who made reference to the importance of Unified Field Theory in the propulsion of Flying Saucers. They allege that Jessup was also in contact with the Office of Naval Records, who first put him in touch with the Aliens by a book, to further investigate the merits of his theories so that the effects of invisibility, teleportation and space travel could be further researched by the Navy. Some also claim that the reason that Jessup was so aloof and heard to find was that he was assassinated by the Office of Naval Research as he knew too much about the Aliens and about the secrets of Unified Field Theory, teleportation and invisibility. Should it be leaked to the public that such technology was available and not being utilized to treat diseases, eliminate poverty or clean up the planet, it would result in a huge scandal, instead of being used solely for the purpose of espionage and warfare. Proponents claimed that his suicide was staged by the Office of Naval Research. However, it is widely accepted that he was failing in his writing career, that his wife left him, and when his sister was informed she simply asked: \u201cHow did he do it?\u201d. This would imply that she was not surprised, Jessup, having a history of serious depression. At the time of the suicide, he had been in a serious car accident and was recovering very slowly.\nReferences to the Philadelphia Experiment have appeared in much popular culture. The movies 100 Million BC, Outpost and Devils Pass all make reference to the Philadelphia Experiment. Notable TV shows which mention the Philadelphia experiment include the X-Files, Pawn Stars, Sanctuary, Warehouse 13 and the Macros. It has also appeared in the literary works of Clive Cussler\u2019s Mirage, Jeff\u2019s Smith\u2019s graphic novel Rasl and Green Fire, as well as video games such as Assassins Creed and Half-Life.\nCredibility of the Philadelphia Experiment Theory\nThe science does not back up what the Philadelphia Theorists are saying. If a working Unified Field Theory was put into place, the technology would be incredible. A working theory has yet to be discovered.\nIt is said that there was a correspondence between Carlos Allende and Morris Jessup before and after the Philadelphia experiment. Such correspondence would be the nail in the coffin for a theory such as this. Because the theory originates from one person and one person only. And then this person would have happened to be in touch for the main instigator of the theory. Allende is also said to have had a history of psychiatric illnesses and as a result fabricated the story on his own.\nThere are also some inconsistencies with regard to the timeline of the event. The ship was said to have remained in New York until September-October; however, the Philadelphia experiment took place in October 1943. The usual response from theorists, when met with this, is that it is possible that the shipping logs were falsified to cover it up. Possibly true but the onus of proof lies as always with the theory proponents. Navy veterans have also told a local Philadelphia newspaper that the ship never made port in Philadelphia.\nFor its part the Office of Naval Research (ONR) stated in 1966:\n\u201cONR has never conducted investigations on radar invisibility, either in 1943 or at any other time \u201c\nConclusion\nIt is true that the government does actively suppress it\u2019s technology. It is general policy to keep the public as ignorant as possible for a variety of reasons, but it also important to keep technology a secret from their competitor countries who would then engineer similar technology. There are real conspiracies which have documents and have actually happened. Operation Northwoods, for example, where the CIA considered acts of domestic terrorism and blaming it on the Cuban populace to incite a war against communist Cuba is well documented and logical. And the US Public Health Service recruited up to 400 African Americans to test for the cure to syphilis and instead of actually treating them like they said they would, they treated them as guinea pigs without the use of penicillin which would have saved their lives. Thus there are a number of conspiracy theories which when looked at closely, are not really conspiracy theories at all \u2013 Just common sense and a necessary extension of human nature, including desire, motivation and fear of loss.\nThe Philadelphia Conspiracy Theory does not fall under this category of Conspiracy Theory. It rests on one person with no documentation and involves Aliens as well as technology that is simply not available at the present time.\nPhiladelphia Experiment Conspiracy Documentary\nHere is a documentary from History Channel; True Story Of The Philadelphia Experiment (Documentary)",

    "title": "The Protocols of The Elders of Zion",
    "content": "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (or \u201clearned\u201d Elders of Zion) is a text outlining a plan of world domination by the Jewish elites. It is generally accepted that the text was fabricated by Russian Police at the time to spread antisemitism. The term \u201cProtocol\u201d is used to denote minutes of the meeting of the learned elders of Zion. The terms Goyim/Gentile is used by Jews to denote those who are not Jewish \u2013 people who do not follow the religion of Judaism. According to Jewish law, a child born to a Jewish mother or an adult who has converted to the religion of Judaism can be considered Jewish (It is not quite so clear-cut; however, this is generally accurate). A Zionist is someone who believes that the Jewish people should have a homeland in Israel. Zionism was founded by Theodore Herzl in 1897 at the First Zionist Congress. The proponents of the theory go much further and say that the Jews have no intention of settling down in the promised land but instead wish to be separated in the Diaspora far and wide, so they have influence over vast spheres of the economy in different locations. Protocol XI:\n\u201cGod has granted to us, His Chosen People, the gift of dispersion, and from this, which appears to all eyes to be our weakness, has come forth all our strength, which has now brought us to the threshold of sovereignty over all the world\u201d\nThe Protocols of the Elders of Zion is often linked with the New World Order theory. Those events are unfolding exactly as set out in the hundred-year-old document outlining usury and debt as a key method of enslaving the populace to secure obedience through poverty. It links in with the idea of a one world government with a minuscule group of elites at the top who represent Jewish bankers. The Jewish now have now returned to the chosen land of Palestine which theorists contend is the homeland of Jews despite them having no racial connection to it, only a religious one.\nPolitical Landscape\nIt is important to outline the political and historical setting as a background to the publishing and creation of the Protocols. The Bolsheviks ( or \u201cthe Reds\u201d) were a faction of the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). They broke away to form a separate party in 1912 called the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks) or RSDLP(b). In 1918 it was renamed the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks).\nVladimir Lenin\nThey were a revolutionary party whose aim was to unite the various revolutionary groups in Russia under one political party. They ultimately became the Communist Party of Russia. After the Russian revolution of 1917, they founded the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) as they came to power. They were founded by Vladamir Lenin and Alexander Bogdanov and were major political players by 1905. Before the Bolsheviks broke off to form a separate party, there was a split between the Bolsheviks, who advocated militarism, and the Mensheviks who were inclined towards peaceful socialism. Lenin was ultimately viewed as fanatical and not willing to budge on any of his ideas, dividing the world into people who were for him and people who were against him. He was described by fellow revolutionary Leon Trotsky as a Russian Robespierre. Ultimately Lenin\u2019s narrow mindedness would lead to a split in the party. He ultimately viewed that a revolution can only take place with a dictator or a select number of people leading the masses. Lenin was not a complete Marxist. He wanted to abolish social classes but wanted to maintain a distinction between common workers and those in politics. This caused unease within the party.\nIn 1917 Czar Nicholas II was forced to abdicating. Russia was hit harder than any other nation in World War I. There were widespread food riots which the soldiers joined in with. A bitter war would be fought between Lenin, the dictator of the first Marxist state in the world, and the Czarists/aristocracy, who were ultimately annihilated in 1920 in a brutal civil war. In 1922 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was established. Lenin died in 1924 and was ultimately succeeded by Stalin. Hitler and others would later use the Protocols as evidence of a Jewish \u2013 Bolshevik conspiracy to take over the world and eliminate the aristocracy. Protocol III of the Learned Elders of Zion:\n\u201cThe people, under our guidance, have annihilated the aristocracy, who were their one and only defense and foster- mother for the sake of their own advantage which is inseparably bound up with the well-being of the people. Nowadays, with the destruction of the aristocracy, the people have fallen into the grips of merciless money-grinding scoundrels who have laid a pitiless and cruel yoke upon the necks of the workers.\nThe Timeline\nThe Protocols were written at the start of antisemitism in Russia, with thousands of Jews fleeing the country and the start of the pogroms, Jewish concentration camps. Setting the scene for antisemitism was Frederick Millingen\u2019s The Conquest of the World by Jews and Hippolytus Lutostansky\u2019s Jews and the Talmud. Both works claimed that the Jews wanted to divide Russia up for themselves. Jews were also blamed for the loss of the Russo-Japanese war and the revolution of 1905.\nA member of the Czarist secret police, Professor Serge A Milus, is reported to have edited and initially published the protocols. The Protocols first appeared in a Russian newspaper, Znamya, in 1903. It was published originally in 1905 in a book titled The Great in the Small: The Coming of the Anti-Christ and the Rule of Satan on Earth. This was written by Serge A Nilus. Most agree that the protocols were fabricated sometime between 1897 and 1899 under Pyotr Rachovsky, head of the Russian secret police.\nIt is generally accepted the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion was a forgery. In 1921 the London Times produced conclusive proof that the Protocols were a forgery, describing the Protocols as a \u201cclumsy forgery\u201d. Most of the passages of the Protocols have been taken from a French political satire that never mentioned Jews \u2013 Maurice Joly\u2019s Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu (1864). The phrasing between the two texts is almost identical.\nIn 1923 Alfred Rosenberg\u2019s The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and Jewish World Policy was internationally popular. Nazi Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, Joeseph Goebbels, writes in his diary:\n\u201cI believe that The Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion are a forgery. . . . [However,] I believe in the intrinsic but not the factual truth of the Protocols.\u201d\n\nThe protocols would come to play a significant part in the Jewish Holocaust. They had a serious influence on Adolf Hitler who mentioned them frequently in Mein Kampf. The Nazi party published 23 editions of the Protocols before the start of World War II.\nIn 1935 a Swiss court declared the Protocols as \u201cridiculous nonsense\u201d and \u201cobvious forgeries\u201d. The US Senate issued a report in 1964 that the Protocols were fabricated. However even while the Protocols were ridiculed by many, it also had quite a following. In 1974 it was published in India under the title International Conspiracy Against Indians. In 2004 the Protocols were published in Japan. In 2005 an edition of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, authorized by the Syrian Ministry of Information, claims that the Elders of Zion coordinated September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States.\nIt is worth noting that the Bible is only mentioned once in the Protocols and that the Old Testament is quoted in Latin. The Protocols also claim that the Jewish elites had a hand in the French revolutions. However, this is cited as evidence largely discrediting the work of the protocols. At the time of the French revolution, there were only a handful of Jews who were, by and large, the subjects of antisemitism. However, this can also be construed in the opposite light, that there was antisemitic behavior followed by unrest and upheaval, meaning that the antisemitism was proven correct.\nDespite the declaration that the Protocols are a forgery, there are still many followers, described as Neo-Nazi, White Supremacists and Holocaust deniers. Books based on the Holocaust are disseminated worldwide and has a surprising following in Japan, where there are little Jews. The Arab and Islamic world actively teach the protocols to children. It is often used to justify terrorism against Israeli citizens. There is no denying that it is a forgery, however a very accurate one.\nThe Case for the Protocols of the Elders of Zion\n\u201cThe only statement I care to make about the PROTOCOLS is that they fit in with what is going on. They are sixteen years old, and they have fitted the world situation up to this time.\u201d  \u2013 Henry Ford 1921 in an interview with the Washington Post.\nFord funded the printing of over half a million copies, and the Nazi\u2019s used the protocols to stir up antisemitism.\nThe case for the Protocols of the Elders of Zion is quite difficult to debunk. Because it can\u2019t really be argued that the text is prophetic to an incredible degree. Even if it was just a fabrication by the Russian Police, the results of all protocols have come to pass, and the text is not ambiguous in any way. The predictions are performed much more efficiently that what is done by scientists and chartists of today, who rarely get predictions right mere months into the future. The Jews are reported to have been the \u201chidden hand\u201d (a term referred to in many books and novels by the intelligentsia) behind the rise of the Bolsheviks/Communists/Marxists in Russia. They were allegedly put into place to destroy the aristocrats/Czarists and to support communism, both ideas being supported in the Protocols. The table of contents reads as follows:\n\nProtocol I The Basic Doctrine\nProtocol II Economic Wars\nProtocol III Methods of Conquest\nProtocol IV Materialism Replace Religion\nProtocol V Despotism and Modern Progress\nProtocol VI Take-Over Technique\nProtocol VII World-Wide Wars\nProtocol VIII Provisional Government\nProtocol IX Re-education\nProtocol X Preparing for Power\nProtocol XI The Totalitarian State\nProtocol XII Control of the Press\nProtocol XIII Distractions\nProtocol XIV Assault on Religion\nProtocol XV Ruthless Suppression\nProtocol XVI Brainwashing\nProtocol XVII Abuse of Authority\nProtocol XVIII Arrest of Opponents\nProtocol XIX Rulers and People\nProtocol XX Financial Programme\nProtocol XXI Loans and Credit\nProtocol XXII Power of Gold\nProtocol XXIII Instilling Obedience\nProtocol XXIV Qualities of the Ruler\n\n\nProtocol III regarding poverty and rights indicates that rights themselves are practically useless:\n5. All people are chained down to heavy toil by poverty more firmly than ever. They were chained by slavery and serfdom; from these, one way and another, they might free themselves. These could be settled with, but from want, they will never get away. We have included in the constitution such rights as to the masses appear fictitious and not actual rights.All these so-called \u201cPeoples Rights\u201d can exist only in idea, an idea which can never be realized in practical life. What is it to the proletariat laborer, bowed double over his heavy toil, crushed by his lot in life, if talkers get the right to babble, if journalists get the right to scribble any nonsense side by side with good stuff, once the proletariat has no other profit out of the constitution save only those pitiful crumbs which we fling them from our table in return for their voting in favor of what we dictate, in favor of the men we place in power, the servants of our AGENTUR \u2026 Republican rights for a poor man are no more than a bitter piece of irony..\u201d\nProtocol 7 on the Press:\n\u201cWe must compel the governments of the goyim to take action in the direction favored by our widely conceived plan, by what we shall represent as public opinion, secretly prompted by us through the means of that so-called \u2018Great Power\u2019 \u2014 the Press, which, with a few exceptions, is already entirely in our hands\u201d\nOn Politics and institutions\n\u201cThe principal object of our directorate consists in this: to debilitate the public mind by criticism; to lead it away from serious reflections calculated to arouse resistance; to distract the forces of the mind towards a sham fight of empty eloquence. In all ages the peoples of the world, equally with individuals, have accepted words for deeds, for they are content with a show and rarely pause to note, in the public arena, whether promises are followed by performance. Therefore, we shall establish show institutions\u201d\nProtocol No 21 on loans and debt:\n2. We have taken advantage of the venality of administrators and slackness of rulers to get our moneys twice, thrice and more times over, by lending to the GOY governments moneys which were not at all needed by the States. Could anyone do the like in regard to us? \u2026. Therefore, I shall only deal with the details of internal loans. \n3. States announce that such a loan is to be concluded and open subscriptions for their own bills of exchange, that is, for their interest-bearing paper. That they may be within reach of all the price is determined at from a hundred to a thousand; and a discount is made for the earliest subscribers. Next day by artificial means the price of them goes up, the alleged reason being that everyone is rushing to buy them. In a few days, the treasury safes are as they say overflowing and there\u2019s more money than they can do with. The subscription, it is alleged, covers many times over the issue total of the loan; in this lies the whole stage effect \u2013 look you, they say, what confidence is shown in the government\u2019s bills of exchange.\n4. But when the comedy is played out there emerges the fact that a debit and an exceedingly burdensome debit has been created. For the payment of interest, it becomes necessary to have recourse to new loans, which do not swallow up but only add to the capital debt. And when this credit is exhausted it becomes necessary by new taxes to cover, not the loan, BUT ONLY THE INTEREST ON IT. These taxes are a debit employed to cover a debit.\nProtocol 17 refers to the destruction of the clergy and the self-surveillance of citizens by other citizens.\nWE SHALL DESTROY THE CLERGY\n2. we have long past taken care to discredit the priesthood of \u201cgoyim,\u201d and thereby to ruin their mission on earth which in these days might still be a great hindrance to us. Day by day its influence on the peoples of the world is falling lower. Freedom of conscience has been declared everywhere so that now only years divide us from the moment of the complete wrecking of that Christian religion: as to other religions we shall have still less difficulty in dealing with them, but it would be premature to speak of this now. We shall act clericalism and clericals into such narrow frames as to make their influence move in retrogressive proportion to its former progress\u2026\n7\u2026in our programs one-third of our subjects will keep the rest under observation from a sense of duty, on the principle of volunteer service to the state. it will then be no disgrace to be a spy and informer, but a merit.\u201d\nThe Second Edition Protocols\nIt is rumored that Professor Nilus had a second edition ready for print in 1917. However Kerenskil, the new ruler in the aftermath of the revolution, ordered the edition to be destroyed. In 1924 Nilus was arrested in Kiev, imprisoned and tortured, and told by the Jewish president of the court that the treatment was just as he did \u201cthem incalculable harm in publishing the Protocols\u201d. He died in exile in 1929.\nA number of copies of the second edition are alleged to have been sent to various countries.\n\nGermany, Gottfreid zum Beek. (1919)\nEngland, The Britons (1920).\nFrance, by Mgr. Jouin in La Revue Internationale des Societes Secretes, and by Urbain Gohier.\nThe U.S.A , by Small, Maynard & Co. (Boston 1920), and The Beckwith Co (New York 1921).\n\nLater, editions appeared in Italian, Russian, Arabic, and even in Japanese.\nProbably so much money and energy were never before in history expended on the effort to suppress a single document.\u201d The period of 1920 \u201d marks the end of the time when the Jewish question could be impartially openly discussed in public.\u201d Douglas Reed \u2014 \u201cThe Controversy of Zion\u201d\nConclusion\n\nIt is widely accepted that the Protocols of the Elders of Zion was a fabrication. The exact date of the forgery is unknown. And everything associated with the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion is reported to be a hoax of hate and amounts to no more than a spewing of hatred against the Jewish people who have suffered considerably.\nHowever, it could be argued that this point is moot. There is a document of 100 years old which has shown that debt would increase, that, civil liberties would fail, that gold would be removed from the currency, that the press would be manipulated, that usury would be the method of the day, that materialism would replace religion. And everything predicted has come to pass. Not only did it predict it, but it outlined how it would come to pass, how control would be maintained, the destruction of the aristocracy, the condition of the human condition and psyche and exactly what the strengths and weaknesses of the \u201cGoyim\u201d were. In other words, it outlines in graphic detail how the world would move towards debt and class polarization. Thus the situation is that we have an obvious forgery, however one that also predicts, more than a century in advance:\n\nThe death of the Aristocracy, who were finished in Russia 15 years later\nThe rise of money, materialism, debt, inflation and usury\nThe destruction of the clergy and civil liberties\nThe importance of gold as a defense against debt and inflation, which are now all in the hands of a certain few.\nThe use of terrorism to keep governments in check\nThe use of the Media to spread misinformation\nThe surveillance of individual citizens\n\nA more reasoned approach would be to assume that a small faction of Elites who happen to be Jewish are trying to control global resources. It is obvious that if the protocols are true, they do not represent the views of the Jewish people, who simply want a home to call their own and to be free to practice their religion in peace. Thus it might be easier to just call the Zion Elders \u201cBankers\u201d \u2013 the common enemy would be identified without getting quagmired in contentious and fiercely debated religious issues.",

    "title": "Trump Conspiracy Theories",
    "content": "1. Russian Alliance\n\nThere is much hard evidence that Russia interfered in the US election, and that this interference has been designed to damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. There is substantial evidence linking Trump\u2019s foreign policy advisers to Russia, and Trump\u2019s stated policy ideas are extremely favorable to Russian interests. There are numerous interests between the Kremlin and Donald Trump, and they are effectively helping each other. Independent Cybersecurity firms have verified that the DNC hack was related to Russian linked groups, with an IP address linked to a Russian-based IP address that previously attempted to hack the German Parliament.\n\u00a0\nWhen seen in the light of critical thinking the Trump conspiracy is not really a Trump conspiracy after all, more of a probability based on objective reasoning. Trump is friendly towards Putin. Putin was most certainly not a fan of the American\u2019s continued invasion of multiple countries and it\u2019s nuclear threat to the world at large. Hillary claimed that Russia had a hand in hacking her campaign servers which resulted in the revelation of her satanic rituals, Podesta emails and open border policy. All of this is most likely exactly what it is, it\u2019s the under lying conspiracy that gets people tripped up, the core conspiracy. That Hillary is tied to the Elites and the New World Order which aims to impoverish us all. Trump and Putin, though possibly not being angels themselves, have a common enemy of the old established deep state, in the eyes of the Trump Conspiracy Theorists.\nThe truth of the matter is much more straightforward. Trump simply wants more money asking why NATO should protect smaller countries which don\u2019t pay, and Putin wants a restoration of the balance of power in an era of nuclear warheads. Trump wanted to get elected and Putin wanted to remove the more cohesive and established powers of which Clinton was seen to be a part of. What is more interesting is the reports from the various media outlets, spinning the \u201ctruth\u201d, to tie in with which ever faction they happen to be tied to. In any case the truth can be hard to find and often multifaceted, with the Guardian reporting that the Hack might have been staged to look like Russia was behind it, citing former Trump advisor Carter Page. Also of interest are the allegiances of the Intelligence agencies, with the CIA more or less pro-Hillary and reporting on Russia\u2019s definite involvement, and the FBI actively trying to indict Clinton. Trump responded to a CIA intelligence briefing reporting that Russia helped in securing his election with \u201cThese are the same people that said Saddem Hussein had weapons of mass destruction\u201d. It is not a theory that America\u2019s political class seem to be disintegrating and that there is open conflict between intelligence agencies and indeed in fighting within the agencies themselves. The old power structures seem to be breaking down.\n2. Trump Conspiracy and Climate Change\nAbout Climate change Trump has stated:\n\u201cThe concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive\u201c\n\u201cWith the coldest winter ever recorded, with snow setting record levels up and down the coast, the Nobel committee should take the Nobel Prize back from Al Gore\u2026Gore wants us to clean up our factories and plants in order to protect us from global warming, when China and other countries couldn\u2019t care less. It would make us totally noncompetitive in the manufacturing world, and China, Japan and India are laughing at America\u2019s stupidity\u201d\n\u201cIce storm rolls from Texas to Tennessee \u2013 I\u2019m in Los Angeles and it\u2019s freezing. Global warming is a total, and very expensive, hoax!\u201d\n\nClimate Change is a theory that has only grown more conclusive as more studies have been done. There is a direct link between the increasing temperature of the Earth and the burning of fossil fuels, and no other plausible theory to suggest an alternative reason as to why the Earth is actually heating up. Practically all scientists are in agreement with this. It has also been suggested that Trump is biased on this issue due to past experiences with environmental regulatory frameworks as an entrepreneur. A study carried out on different political parties on an international basis found out of 9 Conservatives parties The GOP was the only one to deny Climate Change and that Americans are the most likely to reject Climate Change. Trump wants to put Scott Peruitt in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency, who has stated that Scientists disagree on the man made effects of Global Warming. While most of Trump\u2019s claims are motivated by political concerns to shift doubt on his opponents, Trump does seem to believe that Climate Change is not related to human activity and will doubtless be getting rid of Environmental Regulations which tend to hurt the private business sector.\n3. Vaccines\nTrump has asked Robert Kennedy Junior, a skeptic of childhood vaccines, to lead a panel on the safety of Vaccines. This resulted in widespread concern among the medical community, who are worried about the safety of objective science. There is a general consensus in mainstream science that vaccines do not cause autism and that more research is just wasted money. There is also a consensus that delaying and spreading out the frequency of vaccinations to children is ineffective, something which Trump advocates. Trump also met with Andrew Wakefield, who lost his license after being found to have conducted fraudulent research linking vaccines to autism.\nTrump tweeted:\n\u201cA study says Autism is out of control \u2013 A 78% increase in 10 years. Stop giving Monstrous combined vaccinations !!\u201d\nResponses to this are usually measles related, with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention stating that Measles vaccines have prevented 322 million illnesses and saved nearly $1.4 trillion in costs. However to blindly believe such wild statements is incredibly naive, as this are just projections which are wrong far more often than they are right.\nIn any case it is unclear how much authority Trump will have over childhood vaccinations. There are no Federal laws mandating vaccinations, as it is done on a state by state basis. Most states require children who attend day care centers or schools provide documentation showing proof of vaccination. However there are many exceptions including medical, religious and philosophical reasons. Thus each state has its own vaccination requirements. However the Federal Government has power over policy, much of which is set by the Center for Disease Control. Trumps choice in this matter will set the vaccination schedule, which Trump believes should be spread out and which most scientists agree should stay the same. Trump did Tweet:\n\u201cI\u2019m not against vaccinations for your children, I\u2019m against them in 1 massive dose. Spread them out over a period of time & autism will drop! \u201c\nTrump is currently exploring the possibility of forming a committee on autism and wants to investigate whether or not vaccines are safe. The issue most have with this is that these safeguards are already in place and the results are not really contended. The American Academy of Pediatrics pointed out the importance of vaccines in response to the possible creation of a new Federal Commission under the Trump administration in relation to immunization.\n\u201cVaccines have been part of the fabric of our society for decades and are the most significant medical innovation of our time. Vaccines are safe. Vaccines are effective. Vaccines save lives.Claims that vaccines are linked to autism, or are unsafe when administered according to the recommended schedule, have been disproven by a robust body of medical literature. Delaying vaccines only leaves a child at risk of disease. Vaccines keep communities healthy, and protect some of the most vulnerable in our society, including the elderly, and children who are too young to be vaccinated or have compromised immune systems\u201d\nOther Trump Conspiracies\n\nTrump is himself a devout \u201cconspiracy theorist\u201d, on all issues, not just Vaccines and Climate Change. He has:\n\nBelieved for quite some time that President Obama was not born in the United States.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a birth certificate, or if he does, there\u2019s something on that certificate that is very bad for him. Now, somebody told me \u2014 and I have no idea if this is bad for him or not, but perhaps it would be \u2014 that where it says \u2018religion,\u2019 it might have \u2018Muslim.\u2019 And if you\u2019re a Muslim, you don\u2019t change your religion, by the way.\u201d \nAfter receiving his birth cert he eventually admitted that Obama is in fact a United States Citizen. Obama was born in Hawaii in 1961 and this claim is said to be what initially propelled Trump into politics. He also claimed that Obama did not write the book \u201cDreams from my father\u201d, saying it was written by Bill Ayers, that the official who had the real copies of Obama\u2019s birth cert died suspiciously in a plane crash, that he was originally born \u201cBarry Sotoro\u201d, that Obama never attended Colombia University, that Obama would start a war to win reelection among many other Obama related claims. It seems obvious that he does not believe most of what he says, just makes statements to generate controversy Trump related media. A tactic which quite possibly secured him the presidency.\n\nQuestioned the murder of Vince Foster, aid to former President Bill Clinton. He says the murder was\u201dfishy\u201d and that there are people who believed that the Clinton\u2019s had a hand in the killing as Foster had information damaging to the Clinton\u2019s.\n\n\u201dI will say there are people who continue to bring it up because they think it was absolutely a murder. I don\u2019t do that because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair\u201d\n\nClaimed that the father of his Presidential rival Ted Cruz had a hand in the death of President Kennedy. After Cruz dropped out of the race he said he never really believed that Cruz had a anything to do with the assassination.\nBelieves that Islams hates America, that hatred is at the core of the Islamic religion and that over a third of Muslims would wage war against America.\nClaimed That ISIS tried to attack him\nClaimed That Syrian refugees, are not properly vetted, that they are predominantly young males and that the same refugees bill ISIS for their phones. He also claimed that these refugees are sent only to Republican states and not Democratic ones, and that Syrian refugees are being brought in as part of a grand scheme.\n\n\u201cObviously some people think it\u2019s evil intentions, I think it\u2019s incompetence, regardless, a lot of people think it\u2019s evil intentions.\u201d\nConclusion\n\nTrump and Putin both worked to overthrow and discredit Clinton to an extent and Russia were most likely behind the hacks, but active collaboration is unlikely and Trump is most certainly not a mere puppet of Russia, as claimed by some. The Trump/Putin Conspiracy, by and large, is not really a Trump Conspiracy at all, more likely reasoned observations about recent political events.\nMost of the allegations by Trump which hint at broad conspiracies were created for the sole purpose of attacking his opponent in an under hand manner. He just posits leading questions which don\u2019t exactly say what he means but are designed to lead the consumer down a particular and definite line of thought.\nWhile this is true Trump is definitely anti-vaccine and anti-Climate Change. He is going to bring in legislation and committees which investigate the effects of each of these. Unfortunately all people suffer from confirmation bias, the tendency to re construct reality to back up an already existing belief system. Thus Trump will being in scientists and politicians who already believe that Vaccines are unsafe and that Climate change is a hoax. And experiments will be carried out which prove that this is the case . The aim of all scientific experiments done under the Trump Administration will be carried out to prove that Vaccines are bad and that Climate Change is a hoax.\nDocumentaries\nAs the current President of United States, Donal Trump had several conspiracy theories surrounding him as discussed above. The documentaries below by BBC and the Fifth State make an attempt to examine those theories.\nThe Fifth State: Putin, The FBI and Donald Trump\n\nThe Conspiracy Files: The Trump Dossier \u2013 2016 \u2013 BBC",

    "content": "Perhaps the greatest hip-hop artist of all-time, Tupac Shakur, was one of the first celebrities with ties to the Illuminati. Dying at a young age, 2pac left us with many questions surrounding his death and his thoughts and feelings on life. One of these that can be considered a Tupac conspiracy is his connection and feelings on the Illuminati.\u00a0Tupac was the celebrity that put the term Killuminati meaning on the map. His post humorous rap album entitled \u201cMakaveli:\u00a0 The Don Killuminati\u201d was a testament to some of his thoughts and feelings on the Illuminati. Let\u2019s take a look deeper into the connection between the legendary Tupac Shakur and his thoughts and music related to the Illuminati.\nWhat is the Illuminati?\nThe Illuminati, sometimes referred to as the New World Order, is allegedly a society of rich and powerful families that control basically everything in the world. There are 13 families in the alleged Illuminati and there are also to believe to be a number of celebrities and other rich and powerful people that work for the Illuminati.\nThose who believe in the Illuminati conspiracy feel that the Illuminati controls everything in the world including presidential elections,\u00a0 medical industry, Wall Street,\u00a0 music, film and anything that has to do with money. Ther\u00a0symbol is even on our currency. The Illuminati is believed to pick political leaders with bloodlines that are close to those families that are in power. Believers of the Illuminati theory believe that they not only control almost everything in the world, but also are responsible for deaths of people who are against the Illuminati.\nTupac & Illuminati \u2013 Killuminati\n2pac in prison circa 1995\nThere are many theories on Tupac Shakur\u2019s actual thoughts and feelings about the illuminati,\u00a0but many believed the origins came when he went to prison in 1995. In prison it was said that Tupac learned more about the Illuminati and developed a hatred for the idea of the Illuminati. While much of this was not really spoke of during Tupac\u2019s life, the Illuminati or Killuminati conspiracies came up after his controversial death.\nThe Killuminati meaning\nAfter being gun downed on Las Vegas strip on 09/13/1996 Makaveli: The Don Killuminati album was released. Unlike his previous all-time classic album titled \u201cAll Eyez on Me\u201d, the Don Killuminati album had many deeper songs with very strange predictions of his death. While this album was recorded before Tupac\u2019s passing, many of the lyrics projected his death.\nThe Killuminati meaning was still not as popular in mainstream media as it is today and this album was the catalyst to bring the Tupac Illuminati conspiracy theory to not only mainstream media, but to the younger generation of Americans who mostly did not know much about the Illuminati.\nTupac conspiracy theories are among the most common among African-Americans and younger people who grew up listening to his music. Many people who believe in Tupac conspiracy theories pin his murder on the work of the Illuminati. These conspiracy theorists feel that Tupac was becoming too popular and his message was becoming too influential and that is why the Illuminati stepped in and took his life.\nDocumentaries and Related Videos\n1.

    "title": "Turkey Failed Coup Conspiracy",
    "content": "In July 2016 a rebellion took place in Turkey in response to the harsh policies of dictator Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The coup d\u2019etat was an attempt to rescue Turkey from it\u2019s elected leader, and the Turkish military has a long-standing tradition of stepping in. The Turkish military played a key role in the formation of the state. The voters wish neither the military nor Erdogan to take control and thus the country is in much disarray at present.\nErdogan served as prime minister from 2003 to 2014 and as Mayor of Istanbul from 1994 to 1998. Erdogan had governed in increasingly authoritarian fashion after winning the Turkish election in 2014 for President. The press was censored, political opponents were arrested, protests were stamped out and he continually attempted to exert greater control than what was traditionally indicated by the office of Turkish President.\nHe also increased Islamic rhetoric to a great extent and took a hand in the education system, sign typically associated with a dictator wishing to indoctrinate followers as early as possible. The Turkish military has traditionally seen religion as the enemies of the state and progress, and religious bodies were initially brought under the hand of the government by the army in its formation. The term coup d\u2019etat is used to denote a blow against the state carried out by the military or other elite organizations, as opposed to a typical rebellion carried out by the civilians of the State.\nBackground to Turkish politics\n\nIt is important to note that Turkish politics are deep, dark and highly conspiratorial. There is deep distrust and fear of politics in particular, as well as an atmosphere of fear and distrust in general. Ordinary Turkish civilians are held to be more likely to believe in conspiracies than anywhere else in the world. The \u201cDeep State\u201d is said to operate heavily in Turkey, a term used to denote the \u201chidden hand\u201d used by Adam Smith and numerous other intellectuals to describe the guiding forces behind all politics and all the world\u2019s main treaties and large events. It describes an anti-democratic cabal of vested interests who have a hand internationally in all intelligence agencies, banks, politicians, political parties, judiciary, police and paramilitary forces. The reason that they appear to have a deeper, or at least more obvious, presence in Turkey is the history of Turkey for brutality, dictatorship and proof of activities once believed to be a mere conspiracy. On example of such would be \u201cOperation Gladio\u201d, a European program to provide a contingency force in the event of an invasion by the Soviets, which heavily involved the Turkish military. \u201cOperation Gladio\u201d had links to heroin smuggling and other organized crime and it was held to have been backed by CIA funds.\nWhile there may be some truth to the deep state conspiracy, unfortunately, the exact truth will elude everyone \u2013 To religious fanatics it aims to crush religion, for voters it is intended to crush democracy, for nationalists, it\u2019s a representative of the U.S, for the Anti-Semites the Jews are trying\nTurkey, Coup in the 1980s\nto take over the world. The issue would be that the \u201cDeep State\u201d serves to supply an entity behind whatever fears the individual may have, backed up loosely by the idea of a \u201cDeep State\u201d which has similarities with folklore and fairytale. That said by the 2000\u2019s the Turkish public was fed up of being lied to and demanded to known the links between the media, security forces, government, organized crime and Deep State. The prevailing view is that the Deep State have a hand in all and the lines between all these organizations are very blurred. By 2011 a national survey revealed that the military was perceived as being as corrupt an institution as the political institution, a shape change from being viewed as the most trusted organization less than a decade before. Erdogan rose to power primarily on the basis that he overthrew the Deep State, but since his election, he has been worse than the Deep State and some contend is no more than a mere extension.\nThe Turkey failed coup conspiracy attempt\nTurkey may have had a traditionally powerful military in times past. However this has since changed in the modern era. The coup was a complete failure and served to consolidate Erdogan\u2019s power. The coup d\u2019etat was attempted by a faction of the Turkish armed forces known as the Peace at Home Council. Several key locations were to be captured however all efforts failed after being defeated by State forces. The reasons cited by the council for the rebellion was the disregard for human rights, the rise of the Deep State and the reduction of democracy as well as Turkey\u2019s loss of international standing due to Erdogan\u2019s foreign policy. The government responded to the coup by indicating that the group had links to a known terrorist organization. More than 300 people were killed during the coup and 1200 injured, and there was damage to many government buildings. After the coup, Erdogan consolidated his power and used it as an effort to indict all his enemies. Over 40,000 people were detained, including 10,000 soldiers and almost 3000 judges, for reasons that are not yet clear. 15,000 education staff were suspended. This indicates that Erdogan wants to indoctrinate children with select values and a personal version of history. The licenses of over 20,000 teachers at private institutions have been revoked. The response from Erdogan has all the signs of a classical dictator consolidating power. The response by International bodies was surprising. NATO and other bodies all issued statements to the extent that the democratic institutions of Turkey should be respected. Since 2014 nearly 2000 journalists have been charged with insulting the President, an indictable offense.\nConspiracy\u00a0#1\nThe coup attempt was carried out so poorly and left Erdogan in such a strong political position that many believe that he either engineered it or at the very least took advantage and allowed it to play out. One questioned raised is; why the coup plotters did not execute the primary steps traditionally used when seizing power. They did not target Erdogan and other high-ranking officials, nor any of his party members. No media outlet was taken over and no support was gathered.\nFettullah Gulen, US Cleric from Turkey\nGiven that Turkey has a history of such coup attempts and the military is quite good at their execution it is surprising that this one was carried out without any of the necessary steps to a coup. Within hours of its commencement, ministers were able to issue statements on radio and television which appealed to loyalists to prevent the coup from progressing. No airports or other central transportation hubs were secured by the coup planners. Erdogan\u2019s $700,000,000 palace was neither occupied nor harmed in any way, and they failed to intercept his plane. Everything that would have been evident and beneficial to the success of the coup d\u2019etat was not carried out. The man that Erdogan accused to be the head of the movement swiftly responded that it was most likely a staged coup. US cleric Fetullah Gulen told reporters:\n\u201cThere is a possibility that it could be a staged coup\u201d\nErdogan denied all such claims and indicated that two of his bodyguards were killed when he escaped from his Villa while on holiday in the Mediterranean.\nAnother strand of this theory is that it Erdogan did not plan the coup but took advantage when he became aware of it. There is evidence indicating that Turkish intelligence was aware of the coup six hours in advance. In any case whether directly orchestrated by Erdogan or not there can be no doubt that he took full advantage in its aftermath to secure his political power. And Erdogan was more popular among voters after the coup than he was before it. Erdogan\u2019s claim about the cleric based in Pennsylvania are not without evidence. In 2013 Gulen\u2019s followers in the police opened an investigation into business associates of Erdogan.\nIt is alleged that Erdogan is a mastermind and expert at manipulating the public. Despite his actions, 50% of the population are alleged to be loyally devoted to him, with the other 50% opposing his rule. It is important to mention that he has raised living standards. Setting the public against each other is a tactic cited as being beneficial to political elites who gain from the discord.\nConspiracy\u00a0#2\nThe second conspiracy in relation to the 2016 Turkish Coup d\u2019etat is that it was orchestrated by the CIA. One Turkish paper reported that the coup was financed with CIA funds. Former NATO commander and retired U.S. Army General John F. Campbell is said to have started the coup from a cell in Afghanistan. The financing of the coup is said to have been done through Nigeria\u2019s United Bank for Africa, who have since denied any involvement. The vast majority of Turks believe Gulen was behind the plot, as indicated by Erdogan. Less than 4% of Turks are reported to believe that the U.S had a hand in it. More seasoned Turks with military experience recollect possible U.S involvement in a coup in 1980, where the CIA are reported to have stated \u201cour boys did it\u201d. Many draw parallels between NATO\u2019s endorsement and the alleged coup leadership of former NATO commander and US officer John F. Campbell. And a Turkish coup in 1960 was led by a U.S trained officer. The reasons given for U.S backing is unclear. It either gave funds to the coup in the hope that it would go as badly as it did, consolidating Erdogan\u2019s power. Or it started the coup in a genuine hope that Erdogan would be overthrown. However, this is unlikely, as most CIA-backed foreign operations are traditionally quite successful.\nConclusion: Was the Coup in Turkey Staged?\n\nThe coup was most likely a masterstroke by Erdogan. The most interesting part of the whole coup was that while Erdogan was despised, civilians answered his call to defend the homeland against the coup plotters. While he is not popular the military are not a favorite of the Turkish people either, who do not wish to see a return to military rule. A popular political quote in Turkey is that \u201c the worse democracy is better than no democracy\u201d. This sentence neatly embodies the backing of Erdogan against the coup by Turkish citizens. It is contended by many that the only reason the civilians were able to attack the coup was that the coup was not hostile towards the civilians \u2013 meaning they were freedom fighters for the people.\nTurkey is a place where protest and dissent is not recognized, and thus they flocked to Erdogan\u2019s defense. The key point to mention about Turkey is that it is Democratic, and not Liberal. Meaning it has freely elected leaders but protests are frowned upon. Erdogan had even clamped down harshly on peaceful protests.\nThe staged coup was a huge blow to the traditionally popular military, Erdogan\u2019s greatest enemy. He had been reducing their powers for over a decade but the 2016 coup d\u2019etat was the most crushing blow yet. Shifting blame towards the CIA, the U.S.A\u00a0and the U.S cleric is always going to work on a certain segment of the population, which adds to the misinformation.\n\nErdogan can mention the CIA along with the Deep State and the public will endorse him against this common enemy. There does seem to be a chance that the CIA are involved in every coup or conspiracy and it is easy to shift the focus on the U.S. In the meantime Erdogan enjoys immense and almost unchecked powers. Judges, Journalists and teachers were all replaced in the aftermath of the coup with those more sympathetic to his policies. The rule of law, the free press and an objective education system are now gone from Turkey. But the bottom line for many Turkish citizens is that they still have democracy.\nDocumentaries\nCleansing Turkey",

    "title": "Vaccines",
    "content": "Vaccines are made of weak invaders. Vaccines are effectively small samples of the disease itself. After the immune system has fought off this weakened version of the disease, it now recognizes the antigens for future attacks. Thus if it encounters the same antigens in full force, it will have antibodies at the ready to fight the invaders. From the CDC:\n\u201cVaccines help develop immunity by imitating an infection. This type of infection, however, does not cause illness, but it does cause the immune system to produce T-lymphocytes and antibodies. Sometimes, after getting a vaccine, the imitation infection can cause minor symptoms, such as fever. Such minor symptoms are normal and should be expected as the body builds immunity. Once the imitation infection goes away, the body is left with a supply of \u201cmemory\u201d T-lymphocytes, as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that disease in the future\u201d\nThere are many criticisms of the Vaccine protocol and not just from those usually considered \u201cquacks\u201d. It cannot be argued that the long-term effects of vaccines have not nor will be studied extensively. That said there are some theories which do fall firmly into the realm of conspiracy as they are not substantiated.\n1. The cause of Homosexuality\nItalian Scientist, Gian Paolo Vanoli\nOne Italian Scientist, Paolo Vanoli, has gone so far as to say that Vaccines are the cause of Homosexuality. His assumptions are that Mercury in the brain leads to the straight child becoming homosexual. He blames the increase in vaccines for the increase in the rise of homosexuals. The bias and homophobia are apparent in his representations. Italy is a strongly, Catholic Country that does not respect same-sex marriage where politicians have likened supporting gay marriage as akin to supporting pedophilia. Political and personal biases aside, the 70-year-old scientist does little to support a link between vaccines and homosexuality and falls prey to the standard correlation/causation confusion. The fact that homosexuality is on the rise and the fact that vaccines are on the rise is not indicative that one causes the other. GMO food also has been on the rise, as well as the use of iPads. There is no link between the increase of GMO food and homosexuality.\nIt is still inconclusive whether or not sexuality is the result of nature or nurture, genes or environmental factors. This theory ultimately fails due to the fact that homosexuality was prevalent in ancient cultures, and thus the idea that this \u201caberration\u201d resulted from a toxin in vaccines is preposterous. Homosexuality also occurs in nature. The American Psychological Association has publicly stated that\n\u201cThere is no consensus among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual, bisexual, gay or lesbian orientation.\u201d\n3. The cause of AIDS\nThis one has gotten a little more traction and is linked to the above. It was spread by the media that AIDS originated in Manhattan in the 80\u2019s due to the sexual activities of healthy homosexual predominantly white males. The theorists content that a mass vaccination of Hepatitis B to these men in Manhattan was what resulted in the spreading of the disease. Allegedly over one thousand homosexual males were given the vaccine in the New York Blood Center in Manhattan, with the help of private health contractors Merck and Co. The experiment and results are confidential and thus unverified. In 1981 the first outbreak of AIDS was reported in Manhattan, with over 180 cases by the end of the year.\nAcademic sources have cited the links between the Hep B vaccines and the AIDS\u2019 outbreak. Stevens et Al report that of the initial confidential trial 40 % were HIV positive by 1984. In San Francisco, a Hep B study indicated that 75% were infected with HIV 10 years after the initial study as per Rutherford at Al, 1990. A statistical analysis provided by Tom Keske outlined the probability that AIDS in Manhattan occurred as a result of the Hepatitis B Experiments. It is available here.\nWhile the link between AIDS and Hepatitis B experiments is not conclusive, the widely disseminated media statements that AIDS originated from Homosexual males is quite obviously ridiculous. There is nothing homosexual men were doing in Manhattan in the 80\u2019s that they have not been doing for thousands of years.\n3. Cause Autism\nDr. Andrew Wakefield\nEpidemiological and biological studies have thus far failed to establish a link between autism and the administration of vaccines, as stated on the Oxford Journal web page. The idea that there may be a link between Vaccines and Autism started with Andrew Wakefield, the father of the anti-vaccination movement in the U.S. The initial vaccine that was deemed to cause autism was the MMR ( Measles, Mumps and Rubella) shot. Wakefield was found to have authored a fraudulent study in the 90\u2019s on a small sample set which established an apparent link between autism and the administration of the MMR vaccine. He did not disclose financial interests and the study has since been retracted. Scientific consensus is that the study suffered from numerous procedural errors. No control subjects were included in the study. The data was not disseminated or collected properly. The results of the study were alleged to have been misinterpreted and illogical, not doing enough to ensure a link between the vaccine and Autism. Wakefields\u2019 observations were based on gastrointestinal symptoms. Many later studies (ecological, retrospective and prospective) were carried out with larger historical records and on a larger sample set and found no relationship between the MMR vaccine and the development of autism in children.\nThe presence of Thiomersal is deemed to be the element that causes the alleged autism in children. Thiomersal is a Mercury based preservative found in the MMR vaccine. Studies in Denmark, Sweden and England found that Thimerosal exposure and pervasive developmental disorder diagnosis were found to be independent variables. Meaning that there is no link between Thimerosal and autism as claimed. Alternative theories emerged in relation to the failure to identify a link between Thimerosal containing Vaccines and Autism. One such theory is that too many vaccines cause a weakened immune system which then results in autism and that the immune system in a baby is already weak. This is flawed for several reasons outlined in the website of the Oxford Journal, namely that Autism is not an immune related disease, babies have strong immune systems, multiple vaccinations do not weaken the immune system, and single vaccines do not weaken the immune system. Over twenty epidemiological studies have failed to establish any kind of link between the MMR vaccine, Thiomersal and the emergence of autism in children. Only the truly die-hard conspiracy theorists can claim there to be a link between autism and vaccines, as it would involve a state and private conspiracy spanning decades and countries. Practically every well respected medical journal and all the official studies would have to be labeled as manipulated or controlled.\nThere are claims that a top CDC senior vaccine safety scientist, Dr. William Thompson, confessed to destroying evidence that revealed a 340% increase of case of autism on African American children when administered the MMR vaccine. These are false and he later stated:\n\u201cI want to be absolutely clear that I believe vaccines have saved and continue to save countless lives. I would never suggest that any parent avoid vaccinating children of any race\u201d\nOther Conspiracy Theories about Vaccines\n4. Vaccines are risky\n\nThere has been no study linking vaccines to long-term health symptoms. The death toll directly attributed to vaccines is minimal. Deaths are usually due to the severe allergic reaction, and this is very, very rare. And while it is often contended that the vaccine may lead to the actual disease itself, this is a myth. There has only ever been one case where a vaccine has been shown to result in the disease it was supposed to prevent. And the Oral Polio Vaccine is since out of circulation.\n5. Vaccines contain Deadly toxins\nIt is true that heavy metals are a serious concern. Formaldehyde, Mercury and Aluminium are the main offenders cited in terms of vaccine risk. However, these heavy toxins are only present in minuscule quantities in the vaccines. According to the CDC and FDA formaldehyde is produced in larger quantities bu our own bodies than that contained in vaccines. There is no scientific evidence to show that the levels of these elements found in vaccines are harmful.\n6. Vaccines don\u2019t work\nThis is not true. Many of the anti-vaccine campaigns do cite external factors such as nutrition, exercise and sanitation as variables which could be the reason for the drop in the outbreak of a particular disease. But this does not hold up. For the Hepatitis B disease, reported cases dropped from 20,000 to 1,500 just 3 years after the introduction of the vaccine. Measles in the U.S dropped from 400,000 to 25,000 ten years after the introduction of the Vaccine. The reduction in the outbreak is too large to simply pass off as some other factor as opposed to the one which is the most probable cause of decline.\n7. Vaccines: The Holistic View\nIt goes without saying that most of the theories about vaccines do not hold weight. They cannot be substantiated especially within the complex area of microbiology. However, there is a more straightforward, holistic argument which is on the rise. Simply put, anything which purports to protect against a disease of some kind is always going to have some sort of effect in another part of the body. Toxins have to be detoxified. Chemical reactions have to take place to break down foreign substances. Thus anytime some external defense system is added the body has to accommodate it in some fashion, which leads to an energetic deficit. While the link between Vaccines and specific disease is more than likely overblown, the simple idea that the effects of Vaccines are unknown and not studied and that they will have some sort of blowback is not without merit.\nMany theorists have pointed out the fact that in conventional medical school procedure doctors are not taught much about vaccines other than the fact that vaccines are regarded as safe by the Central Authorities who compile the research, such as the FDA.\nConclusion\n\nWhile by and large there is no conclusive evidence to say that any of the theories propagated by the Anti-Vaccine Movement are true, it is also true that the effects of Vaccines are not well known or studied. Despite all scientific evidence the holistic argument is strong and growing stronger every year. That anything used in excess to prevent persevered dangers results in a weakening of the human organism. A human who is locked away safely indoors and sits for prolonged periods avoiding \u201charmful\u201d outside environments will not be as robust as someone who lives outdoors. This is a simple empirical fact. A human given vaccines for a variety of different diseases will result in a weakened human overall.\nAnd there is no way of counting the energetic cost of the vaccines. Modern Medicine is all about treating disease, and there is no way to measure the cost of lost vitality i.e. if the individual takes an energetic loss via the vaccine or suffers a lack of energy from the heavy metals. The holistic argument could counter that it actually does give you a lifelong disease of a very small proportion, but that the disease is spread out. It could (not that there is any type of correlation or causation) lead to increased Migraines, brain fog, lethargy, depression, headaches, insomnia and we simply would have no idea. There are simply too many variables to account for. Modern medicine has no way of monitoring positive performance, only in documenting the outbreaks of specific diseases which it is actively monitoring via controlled studies. This is a serious flaw in the scientific philosophy which is universally accepted in the West.\nThus, there are no links whatsoever to specific diseases such as homosexuality or Autism. However, vaccines are unstudied and may have some ill effects which we are as of yet unaware of.\nDocumentaries\nBig Pharma Conspiracy: Health Epidemics & The Untold Story of Vaccines\n\nVaccine Nation",

    "title": "Vegan Conspiracy: Cowspiracy",
    "content": "Research Fraud and Vegan Propaganda\n\nThere is one pitfall about the movie Cowspiracy. Practically all its facts and data are known to be wrong by all people who are knowledgeable about science and statistics. One of the main statistics cited in \u201cCowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret\u201d is that 51% of all Greenhouse Gas Emissions (\u201cGHE\u201d) come as a direct result of livestock gas emission. This statistic comes from a single non-peer reviewed report. And the report itself has numerous statistical errors. There are numerous more reliable studies which have been done and show that the number is closer to 15%. This is still a large number which needs to be investigated. But it appears that the two producers simply chose the less accurate study which helped their cause. It is ironic given the accusations in the movie that NGO\u2019s are hiding the science that they prefer to use a study from an NGO instead of a reputable scientific journal. The Union of Concerned Scientists who are concerned about creating a safer and better world using sound science heavily criticized the statistic which was used. Most independent scientific groups still advise focusing on the primary concern, fossil fuels. Scientists are absent throughout the whole movie, with a significant amount of \u201cfacts\u201d and \u201cstatistics\u201d attributed to farmers, executives, authors, and environmentalists.\nEnvironmental Groups are our enemies\n\nThe Conspiracy behind Cowspiracy is that all the NGO\u2019s are just phonies who are not truly battling for the environment and are really just sell outs to the Mega Corporations. The implication from Cowspiracy is that these environmental organizations make money from the Beef industry. This Conspiracy within Cowspiracy is groundless and unfounded. These groups have actually worked for years to prevent pollution in the livestock industry, and have actively campaigned and produced reports and findings in the industry. This was NOT presented in Cowspiracy. The main argument in Cowspiracy was that NGO\u2019s did not do enough to bring awareness to the issue of Green House Gas Emissions produced by livestock on the basis that Livestock Gas emission accounted for 51%. They should not have \u201cwasted\u201d so much time on fossil fuels. However, since the original statistic is inaccurate so is the extrapolation.\nCowspiracy \u2013 Extrapolation, and Exaggeration\n\nCowspiracy does well to generate awareness as to the effect of livestock breeding on climate change. However, it goes down the wrong path. The problem is not beef eating. The problem is the Beef Industry system of production and distribution. The film does not cover sustainable farming methods which have been used for thousands of years but indicates that we should all turn vegan. It almost seems to point the finger at the bovines, which waste so much water and produce so much Methane. It never explores how what they are fed by us, the two footers, increase the Methane they produce, and how concentrating them in a small area and pumping them full of antibiotics, chemicals and hormones might not be the most environmentally protective. There is research to suggest that well-managed cattle in Grassland environments actually lower the level of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, taking these gasses from the atmosphere and storing them in the soil. According to IPCC, grasslands are more efficient at storing carbon than tropical rain forests. Cowspiracy essentially chose unsubstantiated statistics, presented the worst aspects of the beef industry, extrapolated this to all meat eaters (including the indigenous peoples), and urged everyone to go vegan as the only choice to save the planet.\nAs leading Indian environmental scientist Vandana Shiva explains in her book:\n\u201cEcologically, the cow has been central to Indian civilization\u2026By using crop wastes and uncultivated land, indigenous cattle do not compete with humans for food; rather, they provide organic fertilizer for fields and thus enhance food productivity\u2026Indian cattle provide more food than they consume, in contrast to those of the US cattle industry, in which cattle consume six times more food than they provide.\u201d\nVegan Elitism\n\nPossibly the most insidious elements of Cowspiracy is that Vegans are somehow elites and that \u201dit\u2019s not possible to be a meat-eating environmentalist\u201d. This is of course completely false. Many of the hardcore frontline environmentalists stem from Brazil and poorer South American Countries, fighting (and sometimes dying) for the environment long before rich white people decided to watch a movie and commit to a lifestyle of buying expensive vegan products. Many of these people cannot afford the vegan way of life. This exclusive element also ignores the cultural importance of hunting for many indigenous societies. While the current system of rearing and distributing beef cannot go on, it is important to use appropriate terminology and not to tar everyone with the same brush. The problem is specifically the way beef is produced in the U.S.\nWatch the Cowspiracy Documentary and decide for yourself\u2026\nCowspiracy Conclusion\nCowspiracy does do a great job in bringing awareness to the meat industry. Watching a \u201csustainability raised\u201d duck get murdered with a blunt ax and seeing a cow get loaded onto a bulldozer for slaughter unquestionably sheds some light on what truly goes on. However, the producers did start out with the agenda convince more people to go Vegan. Cowspiracy was in no way independent scientific research.\nThere is nothing surprisingly new in this documentary from a conspiracy standpoint. Whenever something sensationalist and over the top comes along, it is usually unsubstantiated. As is the case with a lot of facts and figures with Cowspiracy. The problem is that to precisely analyze what is going on, to see the parameters upon which the figures are based on, takes time, effort, intelligence, and attention. Most people like the facts presented to them on a screen, take it as gospel and vow to never eat meat again. It might be worthwhile considering what would the world eat instead of meat, and how would this affect the environment? Because beef happens to be one of the more nutritionally dense and calorie laden foods. We would doubtless need more farmland to plant acres of crops in the absence of Beef. And this would have effects which are yet unknown.\nTo sum up Cowspiracy, it did well to generate awareness for Animal cruelty, particularly by videoing the slaughter of the cow and the duck. It also did well to create awareness of the environmental impact of fossil fuels. But it went too far, and there is nothing to suggest that beef cannot be sustainably raised in small farms, as has been the case historically. The figures they cite are so misleading as to be completely false. They focus too much on NGO\u2019s who are not hand in hand with the Mega Corporations as suggested, and it also implies that scientists are covering up the effect of the beef industry on climate change, which is not the case given a significant amount of accurate scientific data documenting its effects.\nCowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret\n\nYou may want to check other Food Related Documentaries and Conspiracies",

    "title": "Water Fluoridation",
    "content": "What is Fluoride?\nEthics and Legality of Fluoride\nLibertarian contenders will argue that the government simply has no right to add materials to the public water supply. Fluoridation proponents contend that it is in the interests of public safety to add fluoride to the water, done for the common good. This results in more or less of a standoff between the rights of the individual versus the rights of the majority. However, the rights of the common good is grounded in the fact that Flouride actually does not cause harm and does in fact result in a decrease of dental cavities. Also there is also no way to regulate how much water a person drinks, so someone who drinks a lot of water may be disadvantaged as he/she may be getting toxic levels of fluoride. And it could be argued unfairly that they should just simply buy bottled water, as this could get very expensive given that water is consumed on a daily basis. It would seem from an objective viewpoint that it would be easier on the whole for fluoride proponents to simply get fluoride from another source, such as toothpaste than to insert fluoride into every single\u2019s person\u2019s supply of water.\nFluoride is good\nWater Fluoridation is ranked as beneficial by the Center for Disease Control, the American Medical Association and the American Dental Association. The rationale behind fluoride seems legitimate. In the 1940\u2019s scientists discovered that people who lived near drinking water supplies with levels of fluoride close to or greater than 1 part per million had fewer dental cavities. This has since been backed up with more recent studies. It was found that fluoride can prevent and even reverse tooth decay, mainly by studies conducted by the Center for Disease Control. A Cochrane Meta-Analysis Review reviewed over 214 studies and found that fluoridation of water did result in a reduction of tooth decay.\nFluoride and Cancer\nThe US National Cancer Institute Toxicological Program has found fluoride to be an \u201cequivocal carcinogen\u201d. However, the idea that fluoridated water can cause cancer is unfounded. While it was noted that bone tumors in male rats surfaced when given high levels of fluoride, other studies in humans and animals have shown no link between cancer and fluoridated water.\nThe conclusive finding is that there is no association between cancer and fluoride levels. A Center for Disease Control Public Health Service Report produced in 1991 reviewed more that 50 epidemiological (population) studies and found that there was no cancer risk whatsoever with regard to fluoride levels. One of the studies involved 2.2 million cancer death records in countries with fluoridated water and was unable to establish a link. The Subcommittee on Health Effects of Ingested Fluoride of the National Research Council did an extensive literature review on the relationship and came to the same conclusion as the Public Health Service. While interviews of patients with the cancer in question (osteosarcoma) do allege that fluoride was a factor this is completely unfounded. There is little argument that fluoridation water does not lead to cancer.\nHowever it is important to bear in mind that while a\u00a0specific disease was not reproduced in subsequent studies in humans, that does not make it safe. If fluoridation results in any form of severe disease in rats it is possible that it could have adverse effects on the human organism, which may not manifest in quite the same way. Thus cancer was found in rats, and not in humans. This does not mean fluoride is harmless.\nFluoride is bad \u2013 The Dangers\nIt has been argued that only the official statements from medical authorities, mainly the CDC, suggest that fluoride is safe and effective. In 1999 the EPA headquarters of the Union of Scientists stated that:\n\u201c[our..]opposition to drinking water fluoridation has grown, based on the scientific literature documenting the increasingly out-of-control exposures to fluoride, the lack of benefit to dental health from ingestion of fluoride and the hazards to human health from such ingestion. These hazards include acute toxic hazard, such as to people with impaired kidney function, as well as chronic toxic hazards of gene mutations, cancer, reproductive effects, neurotoxicity, bone pathology and dental fluorosis\u201d \nThe page is available here. There is also evidence that the Environmental Protection Agency was itself ok with the resulting \u201cfunky teeth\u201d of children who took fluoride, because funky teeth was deemed a \u201ccosmetic\u201d issue, and not an issue with serious averse health effects. An EPA employee came to the National Treasury Employee\u2019s Union and a court case ensued. What this effectively means is that a Union of predominantly scientists within the EPA took a case against the EPA themselves, on the grounds that fluoride was not safe despite public statements made by the organization.\nDr. Phyllis Mullenix\nThe harmful effects of fluoride are well documented. Two epidemiological studies in China have demonstrated that the IQ levels of children actually dropped between 5-10 IQ points. The studies are available FluorideResearch and FluorideAlert. These studies were done in the late 1990\u2019s. This was also later confirmed in the West in 2012. A systematic review of all existing research noted that 26 out of the 27 studies found a link between high fluoride levels and low IQ, the average being a difference of 7 IQ points. A systematic review reviews all literature on a topic. In the early 90\u2019s Harvard toxicologist Phyllis Mullenix lost her job after conducting research which proved that fluoride in water could lead to lower IQ levels and producing symptoms in rats that closely resembled Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). She was fired from Forsyth Dental Center Boston days before her research was accepted for publication.\nMultiple studies have indicated that it results in increased fractures for the elderly, that it is highly neurotoxic to rats who have a higher resistance to Fluoride than humans do, that it is associated with decreased birth rates, that it contaminates commercial feed when given to bovines, has been shown to harm owl reproduction, has severe consequences for fetuses when consumed by pregnant women and leads to allergies and hypersensitivity. The amount of studies against fluoride is staggering. According to former EPA scientist Robert Carlton Ph.D. \u201cFluoridation is the greatest case of scientific fraud of this century.\u201d Dr E.H. Bronner, Einstein\u2019s nephew and a chemist, also wrote:\n\u201cEven in small quantities, sodium fluoride is a deadly poison to which no effective antidote has been found. Every exterminator knows that it is the most effective rat-killers\u2026 colorless,odourless,stainless, no antidote, no remedy, no hope. Instant and complete extermination\u2026.the body refuses to assimilate it\u2026Fluoridation of water systems can be slow national suicide, or quick national liquidation.\u201d \nFluoride, Nazi\u2019s and Mind Control\nA conspiracy theory is not complete without some sort of reference to Mind Control, Nazis and power. This theory traces it\u2019s roots to the breakup of IG Farben after World War II. IG Farben was a German Chemical engineering company with links to the Rockefellers, American Banks and Ford. All assets of IG Farben in America were held by a holding company, American IG Farben. Listed on its board of directors was the President of Ford, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, the President of New York Standard Oil, and the Director of the bank of Manhattan. Kellogs, Dupont and Colgate all signed agreements with IG Farben to form a cartel (Allegedly).\nFluoride in Water Conspiracy or Truth?\nAfter WWII The U.S.A sent sent a chemical research worker, Charles Perkins, to take charge of the chemical plants in Germany. The German chemists told Perkins of a scheme they used to control the population in a given area through the use of sodium fluoride, used in German and Russian prison camps to make the prisoners dumb and docile. Farben had created plans during the war to fluoridate occupied countries, as it was found to cause specific damage to a certain segment of the brain. The end result being that the individual was unable to defend his or her freedom (Fluoride is one of the most anti-psychotic substances known, contained in a quarter of all tranquilizers). And as the theory goes the American military organizations, heavily tied to corporations, took over the Nazi research and then decided to implement it on American soil.\nThe scientist who started what theorists call the \u201cdental cavities prevention myth\u201d was known to be employed by the American Aluminum Company (ALCOA), the largest producer of toxic fluoride waste. Fluoride is a natural byproduct of Aluminum. In 1947 Oscar R Ewing, a former ALCOA attorney, was given the role as head of the Federal Security Agency, which gave him the lead over the Public Health Service. Over the next three years, the mass fluoridation of American cities was underway and clean water was no longer available. Manipulating studies to show that fluoride was beneficial had the added effect of defending lawsuits aimed at ALCOA by its workers due to industrial fluoride poisoning, as well as selling the toxic waste itself right into the water supply. This is quite obviously ridiculous and would involve a mass cover up, bribes and assassinations of workers, politicians and journalists over the last 60 or so years for the illegal dumping of unfiltered toxic fluoride into the public water supply.\nHowever, Perkins did go on to write:\n\u201cI say this with all the earnestness and sincerity of a scientist who has spent nearly 20 years\u2019 research into the chemistry, biochemistry, physiology and pathology of fluorine \u2013 any person who drinks artificially fluorinated water for a period of one year or more will never again be the same person mentally or physically.\u201d \nas well as stating that there are a number of ways to protect children against cavities than fluoridation. The letter was dated 1954.\nConclusion\nThis case is clear cut. Fluoride is absolutely toxic and should not be consumed by anyone. There is a clear and established link between lower IQ and fluoridation levels. A systematic review is the absolute gold standard in science and statistics. It reviews all existing and current studies and draws a conclusion. The sample set is therefore huge, and procedural and methodological errors are by and large eliminated in the underlying studies. Reputable journals have published in the matter, including the Harvard Medical Journal, and it is extremely odd that it did not reach mainstream attention.\nStemming from this logic fluoride does result in a reduction of dental cavities, as evidenced by the Cochrane Meta-Analysis of 214 scientific studies and other systematic reviews, such as the York review completed in England in 2000.\nOther ill effects have been noted, in animals and humans. Even without all the dangerous health effects, the costly introduction of fluoride to drinking water to battle cavities when it results in funky teeth can only be described as insane. The biggest issue is how on earth fluoride got added to the water on the pretext of fighting cavities, of all things. Such disastrous consequences for such a tiny perceived benefit. And the legality with which the authorities introduced fluoride to the masses has to questioned.\nThe far swung theories of escaped Nazi\u2019s, mind control and corporate influence can be moved to the side. Companies do not have the power to simply force governments to knowingly introduce a toxic substance to the water supply. Fluoride is not a mind control tool used by \u201cthem\u201d to control \u201cus\u201d and make \u201cus\u201d more docile and subservient, as commonly believed by theorists. It is, however, a dangerous chemical which should be removed at once from the water supply.\nDocumentaries and Related Videos\nFluoride: Poison On Tap\n\nThe Great Culling",

    "title": "Watergate Scandal",
    "content": "The term \u201cWatergate\u201d has come to describe any illicit activity carried out under the Nixon administration in the 1970\u2019s. These activities include the bugging of the offices of the opponents of Richard Nixon and the investigation of groups and figures who were opposed to the ideologies and policies of the Nixon administration. He made extensive use of the FBI, CIA and IRS in order to carry out investigations on selected individuals and groups. Ultimately these activities led to an impeachment process against Nixon which led to his resignation, as well as the indictment of 69 people associated with the numerous scandals. He was the only President to have ever resigned, presiding from 1969 until 1974.\nPresident Nixon\u2019s Resignation Speech\n\nThe Watergate Scandal Begins\nThe scandals were revealed following a break-in at the Democratic National Committee(\u201cDNC\u201d) Watergate office complex in Washington in 1972. The Nixon administration subsequently tried to cover up the conspiracy. However, the conspiracy was investigated by Congress and the Supreme Court. Many of Nixon\u2019s top officials were found guilty. Five individuals were arrested for breaking into the DNC headquarters in Washington by the FBI. The FBI discovered a connection between the burglars and the official organization of Nixon\u2019s campaign. By mid-1973 evidence was mounting against the staff within the Nixon administration, including testimonies from former staff members against current staff members. The Senate Watergate Committee also found that Nixon had a tape recording system in his office which taped all conversations.\nAfter a long drawn out legal battle, the Supreme Court eventually ordered the President to release the tapes to investigators of the government. The tapes revealed how Nixon had tried to cover up his activities after the break in. He was pardoned by his successor Gerald Ford and resigned facing almost certain impeachment.\nWhat was in the Watergate Scandal Tapes?\nWhat exactly happened at Watergate? Nothing indictable was in the Watergate Tapes that Nixon used in his office. However, his general speech and conduct portrayed him as ignorant, vulgar and as somebody with a general disrespect for human beings in general. The editors of The Chicago Tribune, a newspaper once supportive of Nixon, wrote;\n\u201cHe is humorless to the point of being inhumane. He is devious. He is vacillating. He is profane. He is willing to be led. He displays dismaying gaps in knowledge. He is suspicious of his staff. His loyalty is minimal.\u201d\nThe Providence Journal wrote;\n\u201cReading the transcripts is an emetic experience; one comes away feeling unclean\u2026., while the transcripts may not have revealed an indictable offense, they showed Nixon contemptuous of the United States, its institutions, and its people\u201d\nThe tapes revealed several conversations Nixon had with his chief counsel John Dean, where Dean mentioned the subsequent Watergate cover-up, The information included paying a blackmailer to remain silent about the cover up and paying hush money to the five burglars caught in the Watergate Scandal. Many have contended that Nixon\u2019s authorization to pay funds to blackmailers constitutes an obstruction of justice, which is an indictable offense.\nThe main event\nSenior members of Nixon\u2019s reelection organization tried to execute a plan to burgle the DNC headquarters in Washington, the Democrats being the opponents of Nixon\u2019s Republican campaign. As it turns out the plan was just as foolhardy as it sounds. The rationale was to photograph campaign documents and install listening devices inside the office. Both former CIA and former FBI agents have been indicted for having a part in the investigation, and the burglars were caught by the\u201dofficial\u201d FBI. Two phones within the DNC were wiretapped successfully. However, in a bizarre twist, a second burglary was attempted in order to repair the listening devices which were not functioning correctly. The five burglars were said to have been in the office for over 2 hours and carried on their work after finding that the tape that they put down to keep the doors unlocked. They re-taped the locks and continued to work. The security officer, upon finding the locks re-taped, called the police who caught the five burglars.\n\nNixon was held to have been unaware of the burglary, quoted as saying \u201cWho was the asshole who ordered it?\u201d on one of the released tapes. However, he did order the CIA to block the FBI\u2019s investigation into the funding of the operation. It would seem that Nixon did not have a direct hand in the burglary though it was done on his behalf through his funds. He further stated:\n\u201cI can say categorically that\u2026 no one in the White House staff, no one in this Administration, presently employed, was involved in this very bizarre incident.\u201d\nWatergate Scandal leaks begin to spring\nJudge, John Sirica\nThe evidence began to mount up with regard to the break-in. In June 1972 the press reported that one of the Watergate burglars was a Republican Party security aide. In August a $25,000 check meant for the Nixon re-election campaign was found in the bank account of one of the Watergate burglars. Further examination of the bank accounts of the Watergate burglars supported links between the personal finances of the men involved and the funding of the Nixon re-election campaign. All five burglars were tied to the Nixon re-election campaign, causing Judge Sirica to suspect involvement from higher Nixon administration officials. The investigation did not end with the conviction of the Five Watergate burglars but instead grew broader.\nThe \u201cSmoking Gun\u201d tape was revealed in August 1974, where Nixon, Swingle, and Haldeman had conducted a meeting in the Oval Office where they discussed how they would stop the FBI from continuing their investigation of the break-in. Haldeman introduced the topic as follows:\n\u2026 the Democratic break-in thing, we\u2019re back \u2013in the, the problem area because the FBI is not under control, because Gray doesn\u2019t exactly know how to control them, \u2026their investigation is now leading into some productive areas\u00a0\u2026 and it goes in some directions we don\u2019t want it to go\nand continues:\n\u201cthe way to handle this now is for us to have Walters [CIA] call Pat Gray [FBI] and just say, \u2018Stay the hell out of this\u00a0\u2026 this is ah, business here we don\u2019t want you to go any further on it.\u201d\nDestroyed politically after the smoking gun tape was revealed and it was only a matter of time before he resigned.\nPresident Nixon Resigns over Smoking Gun Tape\nSide Conspiracy \u2013 John Dean\nOne conspiracy alleged that the break-in was ordered by White House Counsel John Dean in order to cover up embarrassing information about a call girl who was a friend of Dean\u2019s wife. According to main Watergate figure Gordon Liddy, Watergate was initiated by Dean. This theory is also covered in the book Silent Coup. Dean would go on to spend only four months in prison before emerging without a scratch and wrote a book outlining the disastrous scandals that occurred during the Bush administration. Silent Coup and the Gordon Liddy versions of Watergate are regarded as conspiracy theories. But then again, so was Watergate before it was found to be true. And even if the break-in was all Dean\u2019s doing it ultimately served a great purpose \u2013 to reveal a grossly incompetent president.\nConclusion to the Watergate Scandal\nThere are no credible conspiracy theories surrounding the Watergate Scandal. The case and the tapes expose a grossly incompetent President with no respect for anyone except himself and his agenda. The burglary was carried out in a spectacularly incompetent fashion. Nixon was later caught out in his many attempts to cover up the multiple illicit activities that were carried out on his orders. Even if Nixon did not directly order it, there is more than enough to convict Nixon, including wiretapping and blackmail, not to mention lying on national television multiple times.\nDocumentaries\nApart from the related resignation video of President Nixon addressing the nation,\u00a0there are some documentaries about Watergate Scandal listed below. They are series of documentaries.\n#1 Watergate Scandal \u2013 A Third Rate Burglary\n\n#2 Watergate Scandal \u2013 The Conspiracy Crumbles\n\n#3 Watergate Scandal \u2013 The Fall Of A President",

    "title": "Zionist Conspiracies",
    "content": "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (or \u201clearned\u201d Elders of Zion) is a text outlining a plan of world domination by the Jewish elites. It is generally accepted that the text was fabricated by Russian Police at the time to spread antisemitism. The term \u201cProtocol\u201d is used to denote minutes of the meeting of the learned elders of Zion. The terms Goyim/Gentile is used by Jews to denote those who are not Jewish \u2013 people who do not follow the religion of Judaism. According to Jewish law, a child born to a Jewish mother or an adult who has converted to the religion of Judaism can be considered Jewish (It is not quite so clear-cut; however, this is generally accurate). A Zionist is someone who believes that the Jewish people should have a homeland in Israel. Zionism was founded by Theodore Herzl in 1897 at the First Zionist Congress. The proponents of the theory go much further and say that the Jews have no intention of settling down in the promised land but instead wish to be separated in the Diaspora far and wide, so they have influence over vast spheres of the economy in different locations. Protocol XI:\n\u201cGod has granted to us, His Chosen People, the gift of dispersion, and from this, which appears to all eyes to be our weakness, has come forth all our strength, which has now brought us to the threshold of sovereignty over all the world\u201d\nThe Protocols of the Elders of Zion is often linked with the New World Order theory. Those events are unfolding exactly as set out in the hundred-year-old document outlining usury and debt as a key method of enslaving the populace to secure obedience through poverty. It links in with the idea of a one world government with a minuscule group of elites at the top who represent Jewish bankers. The Jewish now have now returned to the chosen land of Palestine which theorists contend is the homeland of Jews despite them having no racial connection to it, only a religious one.\nPolitical Landscape\nIt is important to outline the political and historical setting as a background to the publishing and creation of the Protocols. The Bolsheviks ( or \u201cthe Reds\u201d) were a faction of the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). They broke away to form a separate party in 1912 called the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks) or RSDLP(b). In 1918 it was renamed the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks).\nVladimir Lenin\nThey were a revolutionary party whose aim was to unite the various revolutionary groups in Russia under one political party. They ultimately became the Communist Party of Russia. After the Russian revolution of 1917, they founded the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) as they came to power. They were founded by Vladamir Lenin and Alexander Bogdanov and were major political players by 1905. Before the Bolsheviks broke off to form a separate party, there was a split between the Bolsheviks, who advocated militarism, and the Mensheviks who were inclined towards peaceful socialism. Lenin was ultimately viewed as fanatical and not willing to budge on any of his ideas, dividing the world into people who were for him and people who were against him. He was described by fellow revolutionary Leon Trotsky as a Russian Robespierre. Ultimately Lenin\u2019s narrow mindedness would lead to a split in the party. He ultimately viewed that a revolution can only take place with a dictator or a select number of people leading the masses. Lenin was not a complete Marxist. He wanted to abolish social classes but wanted to maintain a distinction between common workers and those in politics. This caused unease within the party.\nIn 1917 Czar Nicholas II was forced to abdicating. Russia was hit harder than any other nation in World War I. There were widespread food riots which the soldiers joined in with. A bitter war would be fought between Lenin, the dictator of the first Marxist state in the world, and the Czarists/aristocracy, who were ultimately annihilated in 1920 in a brutal civil war. In 1922 the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was established. Lenin died in 1924 and was ultimately succeeded by Stalin. Hitler and others would later use the Protocols as evidence of a Jewish \u2013 Bolshevik conspiracy to take over the world and eliminate the aristocracy. Protocol III of the Learned Elders of Zion:\n\u201cThe people, under our guidance, have annihilated the aristocracy, who were their one and only defense and foster- mother for the sake of their own advantage which is inseparably bound up with the well-being of the people. Nowadays, with the destruction of the aristocracy, the people have fallen into the grips of merciless money-grinding scoundrels who have laid a pitiless and cruel yoke upon the necks of the workers.\nThe Timeline\nThe Protocols were written at the start of antisemitism in Russia, with thousands of Jews fleeing the country and the start of the pogroms, Jewish concentration camps. Setting the scene for antisemitism was Frederick Millingen\u2019s The Conquest of the World by Jews and Hippolytus Lutostansky\u2019s Jews and the Talmud. Both works claimed that the Jews wanted to divide Russia up for themselves. Jews were also blamed for the loss of the Russo-Japanese war and the revolution of 1905.\nA member of the Czarist secret police, Professor Serge A Milus, is reported to have edited and initially published the protocols. The Protocols first appeared in a Russian newspaper, Znamya, in 1903. It was published originally in 1905 in a book titled The Great in the Small: The Coming of the Anti-Christ and the Rule of Satan on Earth. This was written by Serge A Nilus. Most agree that the protocols were fabricated sometime between 1897 and 1899 under Pyotr Rachovsky, head of the Russian secret police.\nIt is generally accepted the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion was a forgery. In 1921 the London Times produced conclusive proof that the Protocols were a forgery, describing the Protocols as a \u201cclumsy forgery\u201d. Most of the passages of the Protocols have been taken from a French political satire that never mentioned Jews \u2013 Maurice Joly\u2019s Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu (1864). The phrasing between the two texts is almost identical.\nIn 1923 Alfred Rosenberg\u2019s The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and Jewish World Policy was internationally popular. Nazi Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, Joeseph Goebbels, writes in his diary:\n\u201cI believe that The Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion are a forgery. . . . [However,] I believe in the intrinsic but not the factual truth of the Protocols.\u201d\n\nThe protocols would come to play a significant part in the Jewish Holocaust. They had a serious influence on Adolf Hitler who mentioned them frequently in Mein Kampf. The Nazi party published 23 editions of the Protocols before the start of World War II.\nIn 1935 a Swiss court declared the Protocols as \u201cridiculous nonsense\u201d and \u201cobvious forgeries\u201d. The US Senate issued a report in 1964 that the Protocols were fabricated. However even while the Protocols were ridiculed by many, it also had quite a following. In 1974 it was published in India under the title International Conspiracy Against Indians. In 2004 the Protocols were published in Japan. In 2005 an edition of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, authorized by the Syrian Ministry of Information, claims that the Elders of Zion coordinated September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States.\nIt is worth noting that the Bible is only mentioned once in the Protocols and that the Old Testament is quoted in Latin. The Protocols also claim that the Jewish elites had a hand in the French revolutions. However, this is cited as evidence largely discrediting the work of the protocols. At the time of the French revolution, there were only a handful of Jews who were, by and large, the subjects of antisemitism. However, this can also be construed in the opposite light, that there was antisemitic behavior followed by unrest and upheaval, meaning that the antisemitism was proven correct.\nDespite the declaration that the Protocols are a forgery, there are still many followers, described as Neo-Nazi, White Supremacists and Holocaust deniers. Books based on the Holocaust are disseminated worldwide and has a surprising following in Japan, where there are little Jews. The Arab and Islamic world actively teach the protocols to children. It is often used to justify terrorism against Israeli citizens. There is no denying that it is a forgery, however a very accurate one.\nThe Case for the Protocols of the Elders of Zion\n\u201cThe only statement I care to make about the PROTOCOLS is that they fit in with what is going on. They are sixteen years old, and they have fitted the world situation up to this time.\u201d  \u2013 Henry Ford 1921 in an interview with the Washington Post.\nFord funded the printing of over half a million copies, and the Nazi\u2019s used the protocols to stir up antisemitism.\nThe case for the Protocols of the Elders of Zion is quite difficult to debunk. Because it can\u2019t really be argued that the text is prophetic to an incredible degree. Even if it was just a fabrication by the Russian Police, the results of all protocols have come to pass, and the text is not ambiguous in any way. The predictions are performed much more efficiently that what is done by scientists and chartists of today, who rarely get predictions right mere months into the future. The Jews are reported to have been the \u201chidden hand\u201d (a term referred to in many books and novels by the intelligentsia) behind the rise of the Bolsheviks/Communists/Marxists in Russia. They were allegedly put into place to destroy the aristocrats/Czarists and to support communism, both ideas being supported in the Protocols. The table of contents reads as follows:\n\nProtocol I The Basic Doctrine\nProtocol II Economic Wars\nProtocol III Methods of Conquest\nProtocol IV Materialism Replace Religion\nProtocol V Despotism and Modern Progress\nProtocol VI Take-Over Technique\nProtocol VII World-Wide Wars\nProtocol VIII Provisional Government\nProtocol IX Re-education\nProtocol X Preparing for Power\nProtocol XI The Totalitarian State\nProtocol XII Control of the Press\nProtocol XIII Distractions\nProtocol XIV Assault on Religion\nProtocol XV Ruthless Suppression\nProtocol XVI Brainwashing\nProtocol XVII Abuse of Authority\nProtocol XVIII Arrest of Opponents\nProtocol XIX Rulers and People\nProtocol XX Financial Programme\nProtocol XXI Loans and Credit\nProtocol XXII Power of Gold\nProtocol XXIII Instilling Obedience\nProtocol XXIV Qualities of the Ruler\n\n\nProtocol III regarding poverty and rights indicates that rights themselves are practically useless:\n5. All people are chained down to heavy toil by poverty more firmly than ever. They were chained by slavery and serfdom; from these, one way and another, they might free themselves. These could be settled with, but from want, they will never get away. We have included in the constitution such rights as to the masses appear fictitious and not actual rights.All these so-called \u201cPeoples Rights\u201d can exist only in idea, an idea which can never be realized in practical life. What is it to the proletariat laborer, bowed double over his heavy toil, crushed by his lot in life, if talkers get the right to babble, if journalists get the right to scribble any nonsense side by side with good stuff, once the proletariat has no other profit out of the constitution save only those pitiful crumbs which we fling them from our table in return for their voting in favor of what we dictate, in favor of the men we place in power, the servants of our AGENTUR \u2026 Republican rights for a poor man are no more than a bitter piece of irony..\u201d\nProtocol 7 on the Press:\n\u201cWe must compel the governments of the goyim to take action in the direction favored by our widely conceived plan, by what we shall represent as public opinion, secretly prompted by us through the means of that so-called \u2018Great Power\u2019 \u2014 the Press, which, with a few exceptions, is already entirely in our hands\u201d\nOn Politics and institutions\n\u201cThe principal object of our directorate consists in this: to debilitate the public mind by criticism; to lead it away from serious reflections calculated to arouse resistance; to distract the forces of the mind towards a sham fight of empty eloquence. In all ages the peoples of the world, equally with individuals, have accepted words for deeds, for they are content with a show and rarely pause to note, in the public arena, whether promises are followed by performance. Therefore, we shall establish show institutions\u201d\nProtocol No 21 on loans and debt:\n2. We have taken advantage of the venality of administrators and slackness of rulers to get our moneys twice, thrice and more times over, by lending to the GOY governments moneys which were not at all needed by the States. Could anyone do the like in regard to us? \u2026. Therefore, I shall only deal with the details of internal loans. \n3. States announce that such a loan is to be concluded and open subscriptions for their own bills of exchange, that is, for their interest-bearing paper. That they may be within reach of all the price is determined at from a hundred to a thousand; and a discount is made for the earliest subscribers. Next day by artificial means the price of them goes up, the alleged reason being that everyone is rushing to buy them. In a few days, the treasury safes are as they say overflowing and there\u2019s more money than they can do with. The subscription, it is alleged, covers many times over the issue total of the loan; in this lies the whole stage effect \u2013 look you, they say, what confidence is shown in the government\u2019s bills of exchange.\n4. But when the comedy is played out there emerges the fact that a debit and an exceedingly burdensome debit has been created. For the payment of interest, it becomes necessary to have recourse to new loans, which do not swallow up but only add to the capital debt. And when this credit is exhausted it becomes necessary by new taxes to cover, not the loan, BUT ONLY THE INTEREST ON IT. These taxes are a debit employed to cover a debit.\nProtocol 17 refers to the destruction of the clergy and the self-surveillance of citizens by other citizens.\nWE SHALL DESTROY THE CLERGY\n2. we have long past taken care to discredit the priesthood of \u201cgoyim,\u201d and thereby to ruin their mission on earth which in these days might still be a great hindrance to us. Day by day its influence on the peoples of the world is falling lower. Freedom of conscience has been declared everywhere so that now only years divide us from the moment of the complete wrecking of that Christian religion: as to other religions we shall have still less difficulty in dealing with them, but it would be premature to speak of this now. We shall act clericalism and clericals into such narrow frames as to make their influence move in retrogressive proportion to its former progress\u2026\n7\u2026in our programs one-third of our subjects will keep the rest under observation from a sense of duty, on the principle of volunteer service to the state. it will then be no disgrace to be a spy and informer, but a merit.\u201d\nThe Second Edition Protocols\nIt is rumored that Professor Nilus had a second edition ready for print in 1917. However Kerenskil, the new ruler in the aftermath of the revolution, ordered the edition to be destroyed. In 1924 Nilus was arrested in Kiev, imprisoned and tortured, and told by the Jewish president of the court that the treatment was just as he did \u201cthem incalculable harm in publishing the Protocols\u201d. He died in exile in 1929.\nA number of copies of the second edition are alleged to have been sent to various countries.\n\nGermany, Gottfreid zum Beek. (1919)\nEngland, The Britons (1920).\nFrance, by Mgr. Jouin in La Revue Internationale des Societes Secretes, and by Urbain Gohier.\nThe U.S.A , by Small, Maynard & Co. (Boston 1920), and The Beckwith Co (New York 1921).\n\nLater, editions appeared in Italian, Russian, Arabic, and even in Japanese.\nProbably so much money and energy were never before in history expended on the effort to suppress a single document.\u201d The period of 1920 \u201d marks the end of the time when the Jewish question could be impartially openly discussed in public.\u201d Douglas Reed \u2014 \u201cThe Controversy of Zion\u201d\nConclusion\n\nIt is widely accepted that the Protocols of the Elders of Zion was a fabrication. The exact date of the forgery is unknown. And everything associated with the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion is reported to be a hoax of hate and amounts to no more than a spewing of hatred against the Jewish people who have suffered considerably.\nHowever, it could be argued that this point is moot. There is a document of 100 years old which has shown that debt would increase, that, civil liberties would fail, that gold would be removed from the currency, that the press would be manipulated, that usury would be the method of the day, that materialism would replace religion. And everything predicted has come to pass. Not only did it predict it, but it outlined how it would come to pass, how control would be maintained, the destruction of the aristocracy, the condition of the human condition and psyche and exactly what the strengths and weaknesses of the \u201cGoyim\u201d were. In other words, it outlines in graphic detail how the world would move towards debt and class polarization. Thus the situation is that we have an obvious forgery, however one that also predicts, more than a century in advance:\n\nThe death of the Aristocracy, who were finished in Russia 15 years later\nThe rise of money, materialism, debt, inflation and usury\nThe destruction of the clergy and civil liberties\nThe importance of gold as a defense against debt and inflation, which are now all in the hands of a certain few.\nThe use of terrorism to keep governments in check\nThe use of the Media to spread misinformation\nThe surveillance of individual citizens\n\nA more reasoned approach would be to assume that a small faction of Elites who happen to be Jewish are trying to control global resources. It is obvious that if the protocols are true, they do not represent the views of the Jewish people, who simply want a home to call their own and to be free to practice their religion in peace. Thus it might be easier to just call the Zion Elders \u201cBankers\u201d \u2013 the common enemy would be identified without getting quagmired in contentious and fiercely debated religious issues.",
