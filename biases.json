            "title": "action-bias",
            "definition": "The action bias describes our tendency to favor action over inaction, often to our benefit. However, there are times when we feel compelled to act, even if theres no evidence that it will lead to a better outcome than doing nothing would. Our tendency to respond with action as a default, automatic reaction, even without solid rationale to support it, has been termed the action bias.",
            "individual_effect": "Prioritizing action over inaction, without sufficient reasoning to support it, can lead to mishandling of a situation. Its an automatic response, based upon impulse instead of logic. Since its a decision made without taking all possible information into consideration, the action bias can cause us to go down a less effective route, which can compromise the outcome of the situation. ",
            "systematic_effect": "As a society, we view inaction as wrong, and continued engagement in the action bias only serves to propagate this belief. Even if the decision to act doesnt pan out as wed hoped, we can rationalize that it would have been worse if wed done nothing, even though that very well might not have been the case. This serves to reinforce our view of action as superior to inaction, which in turn allows for the continuation of this pattern of poor decision-making.",
            "reason": "The devil makes work for idle hands is an old expression that emphasizes the notion that staying busy will keep you out of trouble. Its just one example of how we consider a lack of action to be wrong. Such notions predate the development of the concept of the action bias by centuries. Although this bias is nothing new, the theory behind it was only developed recently. Thus, there are many things that we still dont fully understand about it. Despite these limitations, researchers have found some evidence for what context gives rise to the action bias.",
            "neccessity": "We equate taking action and keeping busy with productivity, another quality we assign significant value to. However, a lack of action often proves to be more productive than taking action. Imagine being in bumper-to-bumper traffic on a highway. You might find yourself frustrated at the fact that youre moving at a snails pace, and consider getting off at the first exit to take another route to your destination. This could wind up taking even longer than staying on the busy highway would have, and could cause you to use more gas. While logic tells us that staying on the highway is more efficient, we feel that getting off of the highway is the more efficient decision. This is because, when we sit in traffic, we feel like were getting nowhere, while on the other route were able to drive at a reasonable speed. Here, taking action is actually less productive than deciding to stay put, even if it doesnt feel that way.",
            "avoid": "Choosing inaction over action doesnt mean giving up. As a matter of fact, its frequently more productive to do so. Consequently, its necessary to avoid the action bias, so that action doesnt continue to be our default response. Choosing a lack of action is a good practice in patience, which can be challenging to develop. Self-control is a skill that needs to be cultivated and the more we work on it, the stronger it gets.",
            "started": "Patt and Zeckhauser are pioneers in the study of the action bias, having published their theoretical and empirical exploration of the bias in 2000.6 Their paper defined the action bias as a penchant for action [that is] a product of nonrational behavior. They were some of the first to suggest that our proclivity for action is a heuristic, a tool which is often useful, but can unfortunately lead to poor decision-making in a variety of circumstances.",
            "example1": "The action bias regularly manifests in the health sector, specifically, when it comes to treating patients with unusual symptom presentations that doesn't seem to require urgent care. Its been shown that, if theres no clear diagnosis, the majority of doctors prefer to run tests to attempt to find the root of the problem, rather than schedule a follow-up to see if symptoms have changed.7",
            "example2": "There is an abundance of examples of the action bias to be found in the realm of investments. Many factors can trigger this bias. As mentioned previously, overconfidence and a desire for control are both leading causes of the action bias. Excessive confidence in ones ability to make good decisions with a guaranteed positive outcome can lead to over-trading. Similarly, a desire to maintain control over your investments might lead you to trade more frequently than you should. However, its been found that, in general, self-control makes for a far better strategy, and patience pays off where over-trading doesnt."

            "title": "affect-heuristic",
            "definition": "The affect heuristic describes how we often rely on our emotions, rather than concrete information, when making decisions. This allows us to reach a conclusion quickly and easily, but can also distort our thinking and lead us to make suboptimal choices.",
            "individual_effect": "The affect heuristic can influence decisions in essentially any domain, and it has been demonstrated that we tend to rely on this heuristic more in situations where there is significant time pressure1. This means that if we are ever given an important decision to make quickly, we may resort to this heuristic, which has the potential to lead us to choose poorly.",
            "systematic_effect": "The affect heuristic can be used to make positive changes within society, especially through public health campaigns. These campaigns often use fear appeals to decrease certain unhealthy behaviors within society by sharing statistics, information, and images that lead people to experience negative affect in regard to that behavior. The efficacy of fear appeals has been hotly debated over the years but, in theory, this is a potentially beneficial application of the affect heuristic.",
            "reason": "Dual process theory posits that we have two cognitive systems: one that is automatic and one that is effortful. It has been suggested that the affect heuristic results from the former.2 In addition to this, the affect heuristic occurs because our affective, or mood, state alters our perception of the risks and benefits of a particular outcome.",
            "neccessity": "No matter our age, our careers, or where we live, were all faced with decisions each and every day. Granted, some are more important than others, but even seemingly small decisions can have significant consequences. In order to ensure that were making the best choices we can, we need to be aware of the different heuristics and biases that can influence our decision-making. This way, we can learn how to avoid them, or at least recognize them in other people.",
            "avoid": "By being aware of the fact that our emotions can impact our decisions, we can start to avoid the affect heuristic. When faced with big decisions, we should not rely exclusively on System 1 thinking. By taking the time to think logically about the choice we have to make and considering all possible options, we prevent ourselves from taking mental shortcuts to reach a conclusion. Furthermore, being aware of ones emotional state is useful for avoiding the affect heuristic. If we can recognize that we are feeling a certain way, such as happy, sad, or angry, we can acknowledge that our emotions have the potential to affect our decision-making and, in doing so, remind ourselves of the importance of using System 2 thinking. Finally, if were ever given an important decision to make when were feeling particularly emotional, whether it is a positive emotion or a negative one, it can be a good idea to put off making the decision until our emotional state is closer to baseline. This will help to ensure that our choice is not impacted by extreme emotions.",
            "started": "In 1980, Robert B. Zajonc highlighted the importance of affect in decision-making in Feeling and thinking: Preferences Need No Inferences.5 He suggested that all perception has an affective component; he wrote: We do not just see a house: we see a handsome house, an ugly house, or a pretentious house.(p.154). Furthermore, Zajonc demonstrated that our first response upon perceiving a new stimulus is often an emotional one. This was contrary to the accepted belief at the time, which was that affective states only come about after several cognitive and perceptual processes have been carried out. However, Zajonc argued that affect is the only constant; when we perceive a stimulus, we will always feel some emotion towards it, but the level of cognitive activity we experience is subject to vary.",
            "example1": "Public health campaigns often attempt to use the affect heuristic to encourage people to practice healthy behaviors and avoid maladaptive ones. They do so through fear appeals, which serve to scare the population by presenting the worst-case scenario consequences of continuing to partake in certain behaviors. The classic example of this is anti-smoking campaigns. Pictures are commonly used to deter people by smoking, with images of the teeth and lungs of longtime smokers displayed on the sides of cigarette packages in some countries, like Canada. Additionally, these public health campaigns stress the severity of the consequences of smoking, which include increased risk of cancer, stroke, and gum disease.",
            "example2": "We think of statistics as cold, hard facts but our interpretations of them are not always objective. The emotions we feel when we view certain statistics can influence the inferences we make from them. Moreover, our emotions can be manipulated by the way the statistics are presented."

            "title": "ambiguity-effect",
            "definition": "The ambiguity effect is a cognitive bias that describes how we tend to avoid options that we consider to be ambiguous or to be missing information. We dislike uncertainty and are therefore more inclined to select an option for which the probability of achieving a certain favorable outcome is known.",
            "individual_effect": "The ambiguity effect can prevent us from giving two viable options equal consideration. As a result, our decision making is affected. We may automatically decide against something based solely on the fact that we feel that putting our trust in the unknown is too risky. Engaging in this cognitive bias limits us, as it prevents us from reaping the long-term benefits of riskier decisions.",
            "systematic_effect": "The ambiguity effect has a wide reach. It can influence small choices made in our day to day lives, but it also has an impact on decision-making on a much larger scale. It can cause institutions, like schools, companies, and governments, to remain committed to failing systems, instead of introducing new policies or programs with the potential for improvement. This happens because, even though these changes could better the system, there is no guarantee that things will not go astray and ultimately result in us being worse off than when they started. Even if the current system isnt optimal, sticking with it feels safer than implementing change, because it is understood and its course is more predictable. Ignoring these calls to action by deciding against taking a risk can cost institutions - and the people theyre supposed to be benefiting - greatly. ",
            "reason": "As with other cognitive biases, there are several theories behind why the ambiguity effect occurs. One is that it is a rule of thumb that is useful for quick, effortless decision-making and problem-solving. Another is that higher levels of ambiguity aversion, a common behavior that many of us engage in, make people more likely to exhibit this bias.",
            "neccessity": "As with any other cognitive bias where decision-making is compromised, it is important to understand what the ambiguity effect is and how it influences us. From there, we can work towards cultivating the ability to recognise when were engaging in this bias. This awareness will help us avoid this bias altogether, which will enable us to make well-informed decisions based in reason.",
            "avoid": "To avoid limiting ourselves, we need to learn to override our initial impulse to avoid ambiguous options and situations. As with any heuristic, the first step to doing so is recognizing its existence and its influence over our decision-making.",
            "started": "The concept of the ambiguity effect was first developed by Daniel Ellsberg in 1961.7 While the term ambiguity effect was not coined in this paper, it laid the groundwork for the theory behind this cognitive bias.",
            "example1": "The ambiguity effect is often seen in medicine, on both the side of the patient and on the side of the doctor.",
            "example2": "Anyone who works in sales should be aware of the ambiguity effect. The amount of information available to your customers can have a big influence over their decision to purchase one of your products."

        {
            "title": "anchoring-bias",
            "definition": "Anchoring bias is a cognitive bias that causes us to rely too heavily on the first piece of information we are given about a topic. When we are setting plans or making estimates about something, we interpret newer information from the reference point of our anchor, instead of seeing it objectively. This can skew our judgment, and prevent us from updating our plans or predictions as much as we should.",
            "individual_effect": "When we become anchored to a specific figure or plan of action, we end up filtering all new information through the framework we initially drew up in our head, distorting our perception. This makes us reluctant to make significant changes to our plans, even if the situation calls for it.",
            "systematic_effect": "Anchoring bias is extremely pervasive, and its thought to drive many other cognitive biases, such as the planning fallacy and the spotlight effect. Anchoring can even influence courtroom judgments, where research shows that prison sentences assigned by jurors and judges can be swayed by providing an anchor.2,3",
            "reason": "Anchoring bias is one of the most robust effects in psychology. Many studies have confirmed its effects, and shown that we can often become anchored by values that arent even relevant to the task at hand. In one study, for example, people were asked for the last two digits of their social security number. Next, they were shown a number of different products, including things like computer equipment, bottles of wine, and boxes of chocolate. For each item, participants indicated whether they would be willing to pay the amount of money formed by their two digits. For example, if somebodys number ended in 34, they would say whether or not they would pay $34 for each item. After that, the researchers asked what the maximum amount was that the participants would be willing to pay.",
            "neccessity": "Anchoring bias is one of the most pervasive cognitive biases. Whether were setting a schedule for a project or trying to decide on a reasonable budget, this bias can skew our perspective and cause us to cling to a particular number or value, even when its irrational.",
            "avoid": "Avoiding anchoring bias entirely probably isnt possible, given how ubiquitous and how powerful it is. Like all cognitive biases, anchoring bias happens subconsciously, and when one isnt aware something is happening, its difficult to interrupt it. Even more frustrating, some of the strategies that intuitively sound like good ways to avoid bias might not work with anchoring. For example, its usually a good idea to take ones time with making a decision, and think it through carefullybut, as discussed above, thinking more about an anchor might actually make this effect stronger, because it results in more anchor-consistent information being activated.",
            "started": "The first mention of anchoring bias was in a 1958 study by Muzafer Sherif, Daniel Taub, and Carl Hovland. These researchers were running a study in psychophysics, a branch of psychology that investigates how we perceive the physical properties of objects. This particular experiment involved having participants estimate the weights of objects. They used the term anchor to describe how the presence of one extreme weight influenced judgments of the other objects.4 The anchoring effect wasnt conceptualized as bias that affected decision making until the late 1960s, and it wasnt until the 1970s that Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky introduced the anchor-and-adjust hypothesis in order to explain this phenomenon.",
            "example1": "In the criminal justice system, prosecutors and attorneys typically demand a certain length of prison sentence for those convicted of a crime. In other cases, a sentence might be recommended by a probation officer. Technically speaking, the judge in a case still has the freedom to sentence a person as they see fitbut research shows that these demands can serve as anchors, influencing the final judgment.",
            "example2": "As most of us know from experience, its easier to end up overeating when we are served a large portion, compared to a smaller one. This effect might be due to anchoring. In a study on anchoring and food intake, participants were asked to imagine being served either a small or a large portion of food, and then to indicate whether they would eat more or less than this amount. Next, they specified exactly how much they believed they would eat. The results showed that participants estimates of how much they would eat were influenced by the anchor they had been exposed to (the imagined large or small portion). This effect was found even when participants had been told to discount the anchor.13"

            "title": "attentional-bias",
            "definition": "The attentional bias describes our tendency to focus on certain elements while ignoring others. Research has shown that many different factors can bias our attention, from external events and stimuli (such as a perceived threat to our safety) to internal states (such as hunger or sadness).",
            "individual_effect": "Our attention is a finite resource: there are limits to how much we can attend to at any given time. In order to make rational decisions, ideally, we would want to consider all of our options and examine them each in turn. When attentional bias shows up, however, we end up directing a much larger share of our focus toward a single option or stimulus, and this comes at the expense of others. It can also make it more difficult for us to let go of distracting or unhelpful thoughts, causing us instead to fixate on (and overthink) certain things.",
            "systematic_effect": "Attentional bias carries implications for many institutions. One important example pertains to law enforcement. One study demonstrated that police officers who were experiencing high levels of anxiety were more likely to shoot at suspects during a training exercise,1 suggesting that anxiety biased the officers to narrowly focus on threat-related information.",
            "reason": "In part, attentional bias is just a consequence of our limited cognitive abilities as humans. As mentioned above, we have a finite capacity for attention; as much as we try to convince ourselves otherwise, we can really only focus on a small number of things at a time. There are various evolutionary and cognitive explanations for why certain things consistently bias our attention.",
            "neccessity": "In our personal and professional lives, attentional bias can give us tunnel vision, overemphasizing some factors and blinding us to others. When we narrowly focus on one or two things, we end up overthinking them, and assigning them greater importance in our decision making than we should. For example, company executives might focus too much on a particular measurement of their employees productivity, and end up ignoring other valuable indicators of performances. Other times, a bias toward emotional information might cause us to make decisions without more objective sources of data.",
            "avoid": "It is difficult to completely avoid attentional bias. Often, the influence of this type of bias on our thinking is at such a deep, automatic level that we are not aware it is happening.",
            "started": "One of the most popular tests for attentional bias originated with an American psychologist named John Ridley Stroop. In 1935, Stroop conducted a now-famous experiment, wherein he presented participants with the names of colors written in various colors of ink. Each word belonged to one of 3 groups: neutral (written in black ink), congruent (the color name matched the color of the ink), or incongruent (the color name did not match the color of the ink). Participants were asked to simply read the written color name aloud, ignoring the color of the ink. It was found that people were slower to name the color when the name and ink colors were incongruent. This paradigm is now known as the Stroop Task.",
            "example1": "People who smoke tobacco are known to have attentional bias for cigarettes and other smoking-related cues. An adapted version of the Stroop task provides empirical evidence of this: smokers, in comparison to non-smokers, are slower to color-name smoking-related words versus neutral words.18",
            "example2": "Our political ideologies have obviously shaped our knowledge about the world. However, what information we pay attention to and remember is subject to bias. Research even suggests that selective attentional bias in conservatives and liberals might contribute to differences in political beliefs."

            "title": "availability-heuristic",
            "definition": "The availability heuristic describes our tendency to use information that comes to mind quickly and easily when making decisions about the future.",
            "individual_effect": "The availability heuristic can lead to bad decision-making because memories that are easily recalled are frequently insufficient for figuring out how likely things are to happen again in the future. Ultimately, this leaves the decision-maker with low-quality information to form the basis of their decision.",
            "systematic_effect": "Exploring the availability heuristic leads to troubling conclusions across many different academic and professional areas. If each one of us analyzes information in a way that prioritizes memorability and nearness over accuracy, then the model of a rational, logical chooser, which is predominant in economics as well as many other fields, can be flawed at times. The implications of the availability heuristic suggest that many academics, policy-makers, business leaders, and media figures have to revisit their basic assumptions about how people think and act in order to improve the quality and accuracy of their work.",
            "reason": "A heuristic is a rule-of-thumb, or a mental shortcut, that helps guide our decisions. When we make a decision, the availability heuristic makes our choice easier. However, the availability heuristic challenges our ability to accurately judge the probability of certain events, as our memories may not be realistic models for forecasting future outcomes.1",
            "neccessity": "The availability heuristic has serious consequences in most professional fields and many aspects of ones daily life. People make thousands of decisions per day and factors such as media coverage, emotional reactions and vivid images have greater influence than they would in an entirely rational calculation. Awareness of our intrinsic biases can be a safeguard against fallacious reasoning, unintentional discrimination or costly mistakes in investments and business decisions.",
            "avoid": "The availability heuristic is a label for the core cognitive function of saving mental effort that we often go through. Unfortunately, unlike a sleight of hand trick, simply knowing how it works is not sufficient to overcome it completely.4 The availability heuristic describes behavior that results from numerous shortcuts that our brain makes in order to process all of the worlds information.",
            "started": "Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahnemans work in 19737 helped generate insights about the availability heuristic. They described the availability heuristic as whenever [one] estimates frequency or probability by the ease with which instances or associations could be brought to mind. In simpler terms, one guesses the likelihood that things happen by using easily recalled memories as a reference.",
            "example1": "Lets say you watch a documentary series, or see a plethora of advertisements, about the luxurious lives of those who won the lottery. After watching, you mistakenly figure that your chances of winning are higher than they actually are. Why did this happen? The documentary showcased the winners luxury house and brand new sports car; this left a strong impression in your mind, which will ultimately help with ease of recall. Later that day, you were feeling lucky, so you bought a Lotto 6/49 ticket with a $40 million jackpot prize.",
            "example2": "A study by Russell Eisenman in 19939 examined how media coverage of specific topics can impact peoples perceptions via the availability heuristic. In this study, college students were asked if drug use in the United States was increasing or decreasing. It was found that they were more likely to say that it was increasing despite reputable survey data from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse that claimed otherwise. Eisenman cited a 1984 study by Tyler and Cook10 which concluded that constant media coverage of certain topics like drug use can distort perceptions of how often those events occur in the real world."

            "definition": "The Bandwagon effect refers to our habit of adopting certain behaviors or beliefs because many other people do the same.",
            "individual_effect": "The bandwagon effect can extend beyond sports. It can affect all sorts of decisions we make in our lives. The primary worry is that it can override the individual critical thinking that often goes into making good decisions. Decisions that benefit many other people do not always benefit us. Consider going to university: while this is a good option for many people (as evidenced by high enrolment in many advanced countries), it is not the right choice for everyone. Some people might benefit more from deciding to take part in trade or apprenticeship programs. It is important that we evaluate ideas and behaviors on the basis of their merit and what they could mean for us, and then make decisions accordingly. The bandwagon effect can prevent this from happening by convincing us that the right decision is the popular decision.",
            "systematic_effect": "A lack of individual critical thinking can have particularly damaging implications when it is widespread. Social and political movements are often fueled by the bandwagon effect. Certainly, not all of them have served the public good or benefited those who join them. People who join the anti-vaccination movement, for instance, become less likely to have their children regularly immunized. Widespread avoidance of vaccinations has been linked to harmful disease outbreaks such as measles.1 History has shown that dangerous populist (sometimes fascist) movements are also driven by a snowballing uptake of political messages aimed at resonating with ordinary people. Damaging movements are often enabled by the lack of critical thinking entailed by the bandwagon effect.",
            "reason": "As an idea or belief increases in popularity, we are more likely to adopt it. There are a few reasons for this. The first of which is efficiency:",
            "neccessity": "It is important that we dont put too much faith in popular opinion as a tool for judging the worth of certain ideas and behaviors. As mentioned above, what is good for the majority of people may not be good for you. Further still, it might not be morally or situationally right. People often make harmful decisions when they are part of a crowd in whats known as mob mentality. It is best to avoid this.",
            "avoid": "While it is impossible to completely rid ourselves of the bandwagon effect, we may be able to counteract our tendency to automatically use social cues as a driving factor when making influential decisions. This can be achieved by first slowing down our decision making process. Allowing some time to pass between when we notice the social signal and our final decision, can allow for critical thinking and prevent us from quickly adopting a popular idea. Second, try to make decisions in an environment where you don't feel pressured by other people. Lastly, consider alternative options that go against the majority view. They may prove to be more beneficial, or at least mitigate the appeal of going with the prevailing sentiment.5",
            "started": "While the phenomenon of ideas becoming more appealing in virtue of their popularity is not a new discovery, using the term bandwagon to denote the effect began in 1848. During Zachary Taylor's successful United States presidential campaign, a performance clown that was popular at the time invited Taylor to join his circus bandwagon. Taylor received a significant amount of recognition, and people started claiming that his political opponents might also want to jump on the bandwagon.6 Academic study of the bandwagon effect gained traction in the 1980s, as scholars studied the effect of public opinion polls on voter opinions. It was feared that published polls encouraged people to vote according to popular opinion rather than their knowledge of the issues at hand.7",
            "example1": "The bandwagon effect is thought to influence political elections as voters are drawn to parties or candidates that they perceive as being popular and therefore likely to win the election. A team of researchers in Germany led by Magdalena Obermaier conducted an experiment with 765 participants in 2017 to look into this relationship.",
            "example2": "The bandwagon effect can influence the decisions made by doctors. Many medical procedures that have been widely practiced for periods in history have subsequently been disproven. Doctors widespread use and support of them can be attributed to their popularity at the time."

As demonstrated by Kahneman and Tversky in the aforementioned example, it can cause us to jump to conclusions about people based on our initial impressions of them.2 In turn, this can lead us to develop preconceived notions about people, as well as to perpetuate potentially harmful stereotypes. This fallacy can also impact our financial decisions, by prompting us to overreact to transient changes in our investments. If the base rate statistics show consistent growth, it is likely that any setbacks are only temporary and that things will get back on track. Yet, if we ignore the base rate information, we may feel inclined to sell, as we may predict that the value of our stocks will continue to decline.3",
            "systematic_effect": "The individual effects of base rate fallacy can add up to become significant challenges if this fallacy is committed by people who make probability judgments about others, such as a doctor diagnosing a patient. In their 1982 book, Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases4, Kahneman and Tversky cited a study in which participants were given the following scenario: If a test to detect a disease whose prevalence is 1/1000 has a false positive rate of 5%, what is the chance that a person found to have a positive result actually has the disease, assuming you know nothing about the person's symptoms or signs? Half the participants responded 95%, the average answer was 56%, and only a handful of participants gave the correct response: 2%. The participants in this study were not physicians themselves, but this example demonstrates how important it is that medical professionals understand base rates, so as not to commit this fallacy. Not taking base rate information into account can have a significant toll on the patients mental wellbeing, and it may prevent physicians from examining other potential causes, as 95% odds seem pretty certain.",
            "reason": "There have been a number of explanations proposed for why the base rate fallacy occurs. One of the main theories posits that it is a matter of relevance, such that we ignore base rate information because we classify it as irrelevant and therefore feel that it should be ignored. It has also been suggested that the base rate fallacy results from the representativeness heuristic.",
            "neccessity": "Having at least a basic knowledge of statistics is useful, as it allows you to interpret information more accurately. It equips you to understand the results of new research, to assess whether or not a study was well-designed, among other things. Knowledge of base rates will allow you to better understand the likelihood of certain events occurring in your life, whether its the odds of winning the lottery or developing a certain condition.",
            "avoid": "To avoid committing the base rate fallacy, we need to work on paying more attention to the base rate information available to us, as well as recognizing that personality and past behaviors are not as reliable predictors of future behavior as we think they are. This requires us to be more effortful when assessing the probability that a given event will occur. Its easier to fall back on effortless, automatic processes, which make decision-making much easier, however, this increases the risk of error. By being aware of this fallacy and taking an active approach to combating it, we can reduce the frequency with which we commit it.",
            "started": "One cannot discuss the topic of base rate fallacy without mentioning Kahneman and Tversky. Their 1973 paper, On the Psychology of Prediction9 described how the representativeness heuristic can lead us to commit the base rate fallacy. They illustrated this through the previously mentioned example of the Tom W. study, in which participants made their predictions based off of the personality sketch and forgot to account for the number of graduate students enrolled in each program.",
            "example1": "This classic example of the base rate fallacy is presented in Bar-Hillels foundational paper on the topic.11 First, participants are given the following base rate information. There are two cab companies in a city: one is the Green company, the other is the Blue company. The names of the company refer to the colors of their respective taxis. It is specified that, of all the cabs in the city, 85% are blue and 15% are green. Then, a scenario is described in which a cab, which a witness later identifies as green, was involved in a hit and run one night. In order to assess the reliability of the witness, the court ordered that their ability to discriminate between blue and green cabs at nighttime be tested. It is shown that the witness can accurately distinguish the colors 80% of the time but confuses them 20% of the time. Participants are then asked to give the likelihood that the cab involved in the hit and run was actually green.",
            "example2": "In their 2000 paper, Feeling holier than thou: are self-serving assessments produced by errors in self- or social prediction?12, Nicholas Epley and David Dunning found that we have a tendency to commit the base rate fallacy when predicting our own behavior because we have access to ample individuating information about ourselves. In their study, university students were given five dollars and asked to predict how much of that money they would donate to one of three charities, as well as how much the average peer would donate. After their initial predictions, the donations of 13 of their peers were revealed, one by one. Participants were allowed to revise their predictions after the donations of three of their peers were revealed, then again after seven were revealed and once more after the thirteenth was revealed. In general, the initial predictions were generous, although people did think their own generosity to be superior to that of their peers: at the start of the study, the average prediction for ones own donation was about $2.75, while the average prediction for their peers was about $2.25. The actual amount donated was $1.50. At the three time points where they were given the chance to revise their predictions, participants adjusted their predictions of their peers donations to match the base rate information they had acquired. After seeing all 13 donations made by their peers, the average prediction of peers donations closely resembled the actual average donation amount of $1.50. Interestingly enough, participants predictions for themselves did not change, even as they gained more base rate information."

Although ideally, we should make purchasing decisions according to rational logic, it is difficult for us to set our emotions aside when money is in question.

They all begin with the notion that as humans, we code and organize our money into certain categories. For example, we tend to mentally split up different sources of income, such as salary versus bonus income, and then end up treating these categories differently. This process is known as mental accounting and causes us not to view or value all money as the same.4 Our minds process money the way a budget does, allocating different money to different purposes.",

Although it may help us think twice before spending the last of our paycheck, the bottom dollar effect occurs when weve already made the decision to spend our money, and it results in feeling unnecessarily bad about our purchase. That means that not only are we out of money, we also feel negative about the purchase that caused us to be in this scenario, so we cant enjoy it.",

Alternatively, a gambler may see a small group of three slot machines in the corner but would rather opt for the much larger congregation of slot machines on the other side of the casino.

We can go to watch our kid play soccer, and we have our cell phone on one hip and our Blackberry on our other hip, and our laptop, presumably, on our laps. And even if theyre all shut off, every minute that were watching our kid [play soccer], we are also asking ourselves, Should I answer this cell phone call? Should I respond to this email? Should I draft this letter?",

This might be why we experience so much choice overload: whereas in the past, many decisions would have been made collectively, or made for us by experts, nowadays, the burden of choice is virtually always with the individual."

            "individual_effect": "Rejecting, rationalizing, or avoiding information that conflicts with our beliefs can lead us to make poor decisions. This is because the information is not rejected because it is false but because it makes us uncomfortable. Information that is both true and useful can often have this effect. Decisions made in the absence of true and useful information can have harmful consequences. Smoking, for example, has been shown to cause cancer and contribute to various other chronic health conditions. Smokers often rationalize their detrimental decision to continue smoking by either denying evidence that supports its health risks or by considering themselves to be the lucky exception.",
            "systematic_effect": "Looking further into the effects of cognitive dissonance leads to troubling conclusions across academia and political society. If researchers tend to analyze information in a way that supports conclusions that are consistent with their own beliefs, then cognitive dissonance may threaten the objective methodology that underpins much of academia today.",
            "reason": "Cognitive dissonance occurs when there is an uncomfortable tension between two or more beliefs that are held simultaneously.2 This most commonly occurs when our behaviors do not align with our attitudes  we believe one thing, but act against those beliefs. The strength of cognitive dissonance, or the pain it causes, depends on the number and relative weight of the conflicting beliefs. This mental conflict and the resulting discomfort motivates us to pick between beliefs by justifying and rationalizing one while rejecting or reducing the importance of the others.",
            "neccessity": "If ignored, our responses to cognitive dissonance can have harmful consequences in our personal and professional lives. Remember the smoking example? This logic can be applied elsewhere in our personal lives. Avoiding dissonance may prevent us from considering new information and consequently, from changing harmful behaviors. If the contradictions between our beliefs and behaviors are not sorted out by making such changes (ie. if we deal with dissonance through rationalization), we might also be subject to hypocrisy.",
            "avoid": "There is no way of avoiding cognitive dissonance itself. Remember that cognitive dissonance is just the discomfort we feel when our beliefs or attitudes contradict each other. What can be mitigated, is our natural response to this discomfort (ie. how we approach dissonance reduction).",
            "started": "While American psychologist Jack Brehm was the first to investigate the relationship between dissonance and decision making in 1956, psychologist Leon Festinger was the first to formulate it into a theory of social psychology.

It has been suggested that this occurs in organizations where the decision-maker is questioning their status in the social hierarchy. Researchers also contend that this behavior is common when governmental policies are being put forth and the person tasked with making the decision is anxious about [their] standing among constituents.1Since commitment bias can result in poor decision making and these kinds of decisions are often important ones, this is cause for concern.",
            "reason": "What commitment bias comes down to is that we are constantly trying to convince ourselves and others that we are rational decision-makers. We do so by maintaining consistency in our actions, as well as by defending our decisions to the people around us, as we feel that this will give us more credence.",
            "neccessity": "Being aware of commitment bias is an advantage in more ways than one. By becoming aware of it, we can begin working towards avoiding it. Since this bias can cause us to make poor decisions, avoiding it can be advantageous. Dismantling this bias is a starting point for personal growth, as doing so allows us to admit when we have made a mistake and learn from our past behavior.",
            "avoid": "Avoiding commitment bias isnt always easy. For one thing, it involves going against our natural drive for consistency. For another, it can make us worry that others will think poorly of us for making bad decisions.",
            "started": "The first description of commitment bias came from Staws 1976 paper, Knee-deep in the big muddy: a study of escalating commitment to a chosen course of action.7He illustrated how, when our decisions have negative consequences, it seems like the obvious course of action would be to try something else instead, yet, these undesirable outcomes often serve to make us more resolute in our initial choice. Staw used the literature on forced compliance studies to support this hypothesis, by explaining how, in these kinds of experiments, participants often try to justify their behavior.",

It is an example of commitment bias, as it occurs even when the outcome isnt one we hoped for. We feel that if we dont stay committed, the investments we made will have all been for nothing. This causes us to feel wasteful and to question our ability to make rational decisions. Even though its usually not the best course of action, it sometimes feels better to suffer through the negative consequences.",

Under experimental conditions, decision-makers have a tendency to actively seek information and assign greater value to evidence confirming their existing beliefs rather than entertaining new ones. This can be considered a form of bias in evidence collection. Conclusions we draw from biased evidence are more likely to be false than those we draw from objective evidence. This is because they are farther from reality.",

If we're so deeply entrenched in our preconceptions that we only consider evidence that supports them, broader socio-political cooperation (that often requires considering other viewpoints) can be hindered. Major social divides and stalled policy-making may begin with our tendency to favor information that confirms our existing beliefs and ignore evidence that does not.",

Declinism clouds our judgment of the present as negative, while we think about the way things once were with rosy retrospection, commonly known as nostalgia or romanticism. Rosy retrospection is the tendency to view the past more positively than it actually was.",

Decoys are asymmetrically dominated: they are completely inferior to one option (the target) but only partially inferior to the other (the competitor). For this reason, the decoy effect is sometimes called the asymmetric dominance effect.",
            "individual_effect": "The decoy effect can cause us to spend and consume more than we really need. When a decoy option is present, we tend to make decisions based less on which option will best suit our purposes, and based more on what feels like the most advantageous choice.",

Over time, this can add up to a big hit on our finances  and also on our health. Many products commonly pushed with decoys are unhealthy foods, such as soft drinks, the overconsumption of which can have serious health consequences. Sugary beverages in particular have been linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic conditions,1 but they are far from the only product that often uses decoys to upsell larger portion sizes.",

Ariely had become interested in the three options available for subscriptions to The Economist: $59 for an online subscription, $125 for a print-only subscription, and finally, $125 for both print and online access. He presented these options to his students and asked them all to pick one. 16% of the students chose the cheaper online subscription, 84% chose the print & web subscription, and nobody chose the $125 print-only subscription.",
            "avoid": "Another tricky thing about the decoy effect: being aware of its existence probably is not enough to avoid it.5 After all, part of why this bias works so well is precisely because it feels rational. When we try to carefully examine our selection, we might just end up doubling down on our choice. That said, there are a few strategies out there to avoid falling into the trap of asymmetric dominance.",
            "started": "The concept of asymmetric dominance was coined by Joel Huber, John Payne, and Chris Puto. Before this point, dominant models of how people make decisions all shared a common assumption: the regularity principle, or the idea that adding a new alternative to a set of options cannot increase the likelihood of choosing a member of the original set.8 In other words, psychologists and economists specifically believed that something like the decoy effect would be impossible, because it violates the regularity condition.",

Some psychologists have even argued that the decoy effect played a major role in the 2000 US presidential election, through independent Ralph Nader.

Part of what gives rise to this bias is the disconnect between our prediction of which option will lead to the most favorable outcome and our actual experience of choosing that option. Furthermore, this bias is driven by the fact that, when we directly compare two options, we tend to focus on specific details, instead of judging each option holistically.",

Awareness of distinction bias can guide us towards making decisions based on separate evaluations instead of joint evaluations, thereby ensuring that we are choosing a certain option because we actually feel it is whats best and not because of how it differs from the alternative.",
            "example1": "The key to avoiding distinction bias is to stop comparing options side-by-side. Joint evaluation, or examining options simultaneously, causes us to view our options as more dissimilar. Separate evaluation, or examining each option on its own, allows us to view each option as its own independent unit. By eliminating this side-by-side comparison, were less likely to overvalue the differences between our options.",

Their theory was that the evaluation mode in which choices and predictions are made is often different from the evaluation mode in which experience takes place\". Specifically, when choosing between the options available to us, we tend to use joint evaluation, while, when experiencing the outcome of our decision, we tend to use separate evaluation. They posited that, due to distinction bias, joint evaluation can lead to both misprediction and mischoice, while the subsequent separate evaluation causes us to see the error in our ways."

It is important to know about the empathy gap, as by being aware, we can try and counter its effects.",

However, the empathy gap is a problem of not being able to correctly identify the power of emotions. Therefore to avoid the empathy gap, although we may not be able to shut off our emotions, we can become better predictors. We need to acknowledge the way that emotions distort our actions instead of pretending we are always rational decision-makers.",

On the one hand, this bias is easily exploited by marketers and salespeople: any tactic that makes us feel a sense of psychological ownership over a product can encourage us to spend more on it. On the other hand, as sellers, the endowment effect can lead us to price things unreasonably, based on a misguided sense that if we dont, well lose out.",

Any sales tactic that tries to inspire a sense of ownership or personal connection to a product is based on the endowment effect: if we feel a sense of psychological ownership, well be willing to pay more for something. As consumers, being aware of this bias helps us recognize times when we are being manipulated, and stop ourselves from overspending.",

Granted, being able to test drive a car before you buy it is important to get a feel for itbut these tactics are also in place to encourage psychological ownership. The more time you spend using and interacting with a product, the more it starts to feel like yours, and the harder it is to part with it.",
            "started": "The term endowment effect was coined by the Nobel prize-winning economist Richard Thaler in 1980. Thaler often collaborated with Daniel Kahneman and Avos Tversky, and the endowment effect is a good example of how their research often overlapped: as Thaler was writing about the endowment effect and other economic phenomena, Kahneman and Tversky were writing about loss aversion and other cognitive biases that affect consumers decision making.",

While members of individualistic cultures tend to think very highly of themselves, people in collectivistic cultures tend more toward self-criticism than self-enhancement.8",

            "systematic_effect": "When people value intrinsic incentives on a personal level but believe others to be motivated by extrinsic factors, a considerable asymmetry emerges. Since other people are made up of individual selves, the sum of individual motivations is no different than its parts.",

One theory however, is that we express a general inclination to positively inflate our own character relative to others when making causal attributions.2 In regard to assumptions around monetary incentives: explicit money-driven behavior often carries a negative connotation in modern society, with people often opting to distance themselves from the label but are comfortable applying it to other people.",

Why would we be more motivated by intellectual stimulation while others are only in it for the money? While there is no easy way to really know which preferences and behaviors can be attributed to which incentives (it is likely a mix of both intrinsic and extrinsic rewards in most cases), it can help to acknowledge this ambiguity and empathize with anothers motives.",

Public affairs and other events that draw attention from the public can be interpreted very differently based on how they are framed. Sometimes, issues or positions that benefit the majority of people can be seen unfavorably because of negative framing. Likewise, policy stances and behaviour that do not further the public good may become popular because their positive attributes are effectively emphasized.1",
            "reason": "Our choices are influenced by the way options are framed through different wordings, reference points, and emphasis. The most common framing draws attention to either the positive gain or negative loss associated with an option. We are susceptible to this sort of framing because we tend to avoid loss.",

As mentioned above, it can impair our decision-making by shedding a positive light on poor information or lesser options. In other words, overvaluing how something is said (its framing) can cause us to undervalue what is being said, which is usually more important. As a result, we may choose worse options that are more effectively framed over better options or information that is framed badly. This holds true in the smaller decisions we make as consumers and citizens, as well as more significant decisions in our personal and professional lives.",
            "avoid": "There are a few strategies for reducing the framing effect. Research has shown that people who are more involved on an issue are less likely to suffer from framing effects surrounding it. Involvement can be thought of as how invested you are in an issue. A 2010 study found that people who are involved with an issue are more motivated to systematically process persuasive messages and are more interested in acquiring information about the product than people who are less involved with the issue. More involved individuals were found to be less susceptible to the framing effect, whereas those who were less involved were more susceptible.",

The bias causes a person to look at a problem in only one specific way and it can prevent them from developing effective solutions to their challenge.

Karl Duncker described functional fixedness as a mental block when using an object in a new way that is required to solve a problem.5 The block Karl emphasizes in his famous experiment demonstrates how an individuals ability to complete a task with specific components were limited, as they were unable to rationalize their use outside of their original purpose.",

In this example, PepsiCos challenge was to reduce the amount of sodium in its potato chips, without altering the salty flavors that customers traditionally loved. PepsiCo first tried to identify a solution to their problem by looking at the food and snack industry for similar challenges faced by their competitors but found nothing notable to their challenge. PepsiCo then worked with a third-party consulting firm and shared their problem to a broad and diverse range of technical experts to find an innovative and feasible solution.",
            "example2": "Another example of functional fixedness showcases how individuals overcame the cognitive bias by simplifying their initial problem. The experiment conducted by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University required participants to design a power strip in which larger plugs would not block adjacent outlets. To promote creative design solutions, researchers gave one set of participants the initial design challenge, and the second set of participants an abstracted version of the problem. The second set of participants were asked to instead fit objects of different sizes into a container without blocking one another, and taking advantage of the containers full capacity. The challenge was reframed to avoid functional fixedness by stripping away the objects details being power strips, plugs, and outlets. By doing this, researchers looked to see which set of participants would develop the most innovative results."

Very few people would try to argue that everybody behaves in exactly the same way, regardless of the circumstances.

In the 1930s, Kurt Lewin, one of the pioneers of modern social psychology, wrote about the importance of the situation in determining peoples behavior, an idea that became central in his work and in the field more generally. The power of situational factors became even more important after World War II, when social psychology made it its mission to understand how it was that human beings could perpetrate the horrors of the Holocaust.",

It can affect any of us when we are assessing the probability of a future event by looking at past events that are similar. We do this all the time in both our personal and professional lives. It is easy to make the mistake of doing this with events that are causally independent, which can mess up our predictions surrounding probability and the decisions that follow from them. We dont want to misidentify characteristics of past relationships as indicators that our current relationships will necessarily follow that path. Nor do we want to look at a string of job rejections as a sign that we wont find a job in the future.",

In other words, the bosses based their technical assessments of employees on whether the employees seemed like good or bad people. Alongside other examples, Thorndike was able to conclude that people are unable to separate general assessments of attractiveness from numerous other characteristics. As a result, an error of judgment emerges that leads people to make false assessments about other people and things.",

However, this person could be suffering from a mental illness that cannot be understood without additional conversation and testing. Indeed, some studies have gone so far as to suggest that attractiveness suppresses the accurate recognition of health.5",

There is some evidence to suggest that perceived attractiveness can lead to higher grades in school, although there is also evidence suggesting the contrary.

McDavid predicted that teachers evaluations of childrens performance would be associated with stereotyped perceptions of the students first names. Short essays written by 5th-grade students were evaluated by teachers for the study. The names of the children, however, were replaced by some popular and attractive names while others were replaced with rare and unattractive names. Overall, the study found that the essays with names that were associated with positive stereotypes received the highest grades.

Awareness of heuristics can aid us in avoiding them, which will ultimately lead us to engage in more adaptive behaviors.",
            "avoid": "Heuristics arise from automatic, System 1, thinking. It is a common misconception that errors in judgment can be avoided by relying exclusively on System 2 thinking. However, as pointed out by Kahneman, neither System 2 nor System 1 are infallible.11While System 1 can result in heuristics, which lead to certain biases, System 2 can give rise to other biases, such as the confirmation bias.12Systems 1 and 2 complement each other, and using them together can lead to more rational decision-making. That is, we shouldnt make judgments automatically, without a second thought, but we also shouldnt overthink things to the point where were looking for specific evidence to support our stance. Thus, heuristics can be avoided by making judgments more effortfully, but in doing so we should attempt not to overanalyze the situation.",

One heuristic that frequently comes into play in the realm of advertising is the scarcity heuristic. When assessing the value of something, we often fall back on this heuristic, leading us to believe that the more rare the object in question, the more valuable it is.",
            "example2": "One of the downfalls of heuristics is that they have the potential to lead to stereotyping, which is often harmful. Kahneman and Tversky illustrated how the representativeness heuristic may result in the propagation of stereotypes when they presented participants with a personality sketch of a fictional man named Steve and a list of possible occupations and gave participants the task of ranking the occupations in order of likelihood of them being Steves job. Since the personality sketch described Steve as shy, helpful, introverted, and organized, participants tended to indicate his being a librarian as highly probable.16The stereotype of a librarian used here is, of course, less harmful than many other stereotypes, but this example serves to illustrate the link between heuristics and stereotypes."

It can lead to an overconfidence in our ability to predict these consequences. If we look back at past decisions and conclude that their consequences were indeed known to us at the time (when they werent), then it makes sense that we will overestimate our ability to foresee the implications of our future decisions. This can be dangerous, as our overconfidence may lead us to take unnecessary risks.1 Think of a gambler who looks back at past losses as predictable, making him increasingly confident that his next trip to the casino will be successful.",

An essential part of making good decisions in our personal and professional lives is having realistic predictions about the future.

This can lead to overly confident future predictions that justify risky decisions with bad outcomes.",

By mentally reviewing all the potential outcomes, an event will seem less inevitable and foreseeable.

According to the theory of delay discounting, as delays in receiving rewards increase, so does the value of those rewards. They are discounted in accordance with their delay.

Because parents have invested so much time and energy into raising their children, their evaluation of their kids is higher, and they expect other people to be similarly impressed.

One test used to do so was the leaderless group challenge, in which a group of soldiers was tasked with completing an obstacle course. Kahneman and his colleagues took note of the soldiers leadership qualities and observed how they worked in a team. From this, they predicted how the candidates would perform at officer-training school. Kahneman put it bluntly, stating that our ability to predict performance at the school was negligible. Our predictions were better than blind guesses, but not by much. Yet, this knowledge did not stop them from repeating the same process, nor did it diminish their confidence in their predictions. Kahneman was fascinated by this realization.

Leviton titled Hypoxiaischemia is not an antecedent of most preterm brain damage: the illusion of validity.10Brain damage in premature infants has been termed hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, a label that is applied even when there is no evidence of hypoxia, which occurs when there is an insufficient oxygen supply. The authors concede that hypoxia can result in some brain abnormalities but posit that the majority of abnormalities result from multiple factors, making the name misleading. They believe that the heuristic approach used by doctors to evaluate probabilities and make predictions can lead to the illusion of validity  overconfidence in the accuracy of these assessments. The example they give is that referring to preterm brain damage as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy can result in over-simplification of the condition, which can limit future research and prevent the field from progressing its understanding of the condition. The name increases confidence in the likelihood that hypoxia is the underlying cause of the brain abnormalities, even though that is not necessarily the case. The authors suggest renaming the condition neonatal or newborn encephalopathy, in order to accommodate its other possible causes."

Being offered a reward for doing something doesnt necessarily make people more motivated to do that thingit just makes them motivated to get a reward. The same goes for threats of punishment.

Simply put, if you act a certain way and it leads to a positive outcome, that behavior will be reinforced, and is more likely to recur in the future. On the other hand, if behavior is punished or leads to a negative outcome, the animal becomes less likely to repeat it. This type of learning is known as operant conditioning.

After they escaped, he would put them back in and time them again. On the first try, cats only got out of the box when they accidentally stumbled upon the lever, but as the experiments went on, they got faster and faster at escapingbecause they learned how the lever worked. Based on this, Thorndike coined the law of effect, which states that any behavior that is followed by a positive outcome is likely to be repeated.12",

UCLA social psychologists Zick Rubin and Letitia Ann Peplau aptly state, People often exert tremendous effort in order to help right social wrongs and thus help restore justice in the world. At other times, however, peoples desire to live in a just world leads not to justice but tojustification.1The firm belief in a just world yields a cognitive bias and can result in us justifying a persons suffering through painting them negatively or minimizing their suffering altogether.",

Whenever possible, try to find information about alternatives, and compare your options side-by-side before committing to either one of them. This will prevent you from ignoring certain attributes in favor of others that are easier to evaluate and will make for a more balanced decision.",
            "started": "The less-is-better effect was coined by Christopher Hsee, a behavioral scientist at the University of Chicago. Similar phenomena had been studied by other researchers previously: for example, in a 1995 paper by Victoria Medvec, Scott Madey, and Thomas Gilovich, athletes were found to be less happy after winning a silver medal than they were after they won bronze.5This finding, and others, demonstrated that people often held preferences that were counterintuitive, or seemed to respond more positively to inferior options. However, the less-is-better effect is thought to rely on different mechanisms than other, similar effects, and it stands out because of the fact that it involves a preference reversal when options are presented jointly instead of separately.2",

As Christopher Hsee writes in one of his papers on the less-is-better effect, in some cases, marketers might have two versions of a product that they want to test. As research has shown, they might obtain different results depending on whether they have one group of people sample both products, or if they have two groups each sample one version.2"

For example, when telling a story, we might engage in leveling and sharpening to serve ourconfirmation bias. We might recall information that suits our personally-held belief or opinion, and omit information that contradicts it.1Lets say, for example, I hold the opinion that dogs are dangerous and unfriendly animals. I might verbally recall a story of a dog barking hysterically in the park one day, instilling fear in my listeners and confirming my belief that dogs are dangerous animals. However, I might fail to mention the fact that the dog was just excitedly playing with another dog, in an off-leash section of the park, far away from me and under the watchful supervision of his owner. Other examples might surface with individually held biases about identity markers like gender2, race or age. Leveling and sharpening allow us to promote and reinforce these biases, making it more difficult for us to withhold them.",

Leveling and sharpening also reinforce biases at the group level, therefore fuelling widely-held stereotypes about particular groups of people.",

Most of the time, they serve a positive function byallowing us to focus on the crucial aspects of a memory or experience. We probably dont need to remember every last detail of a meeting we had, or a class we took in college, so the ability to capture and store highlights is incredibly useful. However, there are instances in whichour selective memory gets us into trouble, and leveling and sharpening can also facilitate the spread of rumor and misinformation.2",

They created the Schematizing Test to categorise leveling and sharpening responses: through these test future scholars could measure how much people rely on past memories, and peoples ability to notice small distinctions when faced with a new set of stimuli.5",
            "example1": "Leveling and sharpening are processes we use during memory recollection. Leveling refers to the tendency to omit minor details and distinctions, whereas sharpening occurs when certain aspects of a memory are exaggerated or made more profound. Both leveling and sharpening are important tools since we almost always base judgements on past experiences. However, it is important to be cognizant of leveling and sharpening, because the process can also be responsible for the reinforcement of other biases, as well as the spread of misinformation.",

It is a cognitive shortcut we use when gathering and processing information. Interpreting information and making rational judgements takes time and energy, so our brain seeks shortcuts to make the process easier and more efficient. The confirmation bias can lead us to make poor decisions because it prevents us from questioning our assumptions, and causes us to favor subjective information, at the expense of truth and accuracy."

This effect attracts us to the familiar, and as mentioned before, familiarity isnt a good basis to evaluate things. Sometimes the new option is indeed the best option. Prioritizing the familiar prevents us from venturing into these uncharted waters. This can cause us to make under informed decisions, and prevent us from seizing new opportunities.

Research has shown that repeated exposure that is sustained may limit and then detract from our attraction to a stimulus as it loses novelty. We can actually start to avoid something if we are exposed too much to it. A 1990 study identifies this as boredom with the stimulus.5 This makes sense: you often start by liking a song, and often come to love it as you become more familiar with its sound. But if you listen to the song too much, you become bored of it and dont want to listen to it anymore. A more proactive strategy might be to recognize the value of diversity and new experience. By looking for unfamiliar and different experiences, we might limit how often we are exposed to any one stimulus.",

In his experiments, Zajonc tested how subjects responded to made-up words and Chinese characters.

It is titled Naive Diversification Strategies in Defined Contribution Savings Plans.8Not only is it one of the earliest papers written on this topic, but it is also one of the most cited. One of the key concepts introduced by Benartzi and Thaler is what they called the 1/n heuristic, which describes the phenomenon of an individual dividing their resources equally among the options available to them, with n denoting the number of options. This naive diversification strategy closely resembles our definition of naive allocation.",

In the second condition, the simultaneous choice condition, children were sent to one house, where they were presented with a pile of Three Musketeers bars and a pile of Milky Way bars and were told to take two chocolate bars of their choosing.12"

Lewin did not coin the term naive realism but was a catalyst that sparked interest in the relationship between perception and the material world.",

This can have positive repercussions, as it may lead to greater donations to certain charities or more emphasis on purchasing from ethical suppliers. However, if the company is only doing it for clout, they may not reap the full benefits of the noble edge effect, since consumers may see through the charade and believe it to be nothing but a one-off donation to boost sales. That being said, consumers are not all-perceiving. We can be tricked, often through other cognitive biases, such as theaffect heuristicandcommitment bias, into thinking certain corporate actions are more authentic than they really are.",
            "reason": "The noble edge effect arises from a cognitive bias referred to as the halo effect. The halo effect contends that we associate good with good. Put simply, we view corporate social responsibility as a good thing, therefore we associate positive attributes with the goods and services sold by that company, even if we have never shopped there before. Furthermore, the strength of this bias relies on the perceived motivations of the company, such that people are more likely to be influenced by corporate responsibility when they believe the companys prosocial behavior to be genuine and not driven by self-interest.",
            "neccessity": "Knowing about the noble edge effect is important for two reasons. First, it is important for consumers to be aware of it as, even though philanthropy is likely something we would want to support anyways, it is always good to understand why we make the decisions we do. Instead of allowing biases to unconsciously influence our decision-making, we should be able to recognize that the reason we are willing to go out of our way to shop at a specific store is that we respect that it is making a genuine display of social responsibility.",
            "avoid": "Since the noble edge effect results from the halo effect, which leads us to generalize that the entire company must be fantastic based on the one positive attribute of its acts of social responsibility, it opens us up to disappointment. Perhaps the store is very generous in its donations, but the products it sells just are not suited to our needs, and we would be better off taking our business elsewhere. We should not let the noble edge effect cloud our judgment and force ourselves to buy something from a certain store simply because we respect its philanthropy. Thus, it can be to our benefit to avoid the noble edge effect. The first step to doing so is to acknowledge the existence of the bias. After doing so, we can take a more effortful approach to decision-making. That means instead of automatically deciding to make a purchase from a new store, we should weigh the pros and cons of purchasing from that store against purchasing from one of its competitors. Of course, the fact that this store is socially responsible can be a mark in its favor, but if we feel that its products or services leave much to be desired, perhaps it is time to begin looking at alternatives.",

All participants received the same general description of the winery, but some of the participants were told that the winery donates ten percent of its sales revenue to the American Heart Association, while others were given no information regarding the winerys socially responsible behavior.

They also found that, while nostalgic participants were willing to give away more money, they were not willing to give away more time, which shows that the nostalgia effect is specific to money. Furthermore, nostalgic participants rated money as less important and less desirable than did participants in the neutral condition. Nostalgic participants were also less inclined to put effort into acquiring money. Finally, they demonstrated that the relationship between nostalgia and a greater willingness to spend depends on increased feelings of social connectedness.",

The participants were then told they were going to partake in a game that was being pilot-tested by the lab.

Naturally, marketing companies have picked up on this and used it to their advantage.

The control group is the baseline comparison group, so in the case of the drug trial, they would differ from the experimental group only in that they are not receiving the drug. A double-blind approach is useful in avoiding biased results, as it prevents the researcher from projecting their expectations onto the participant.",

He wrote many papers on the topic, the first of which was written in collaboration with Kermit L. Fode in 1963, and titled The effect of experimenter bias on the performance of the albino rat.2The aim of this paper was to demonstrate the ease with which an experimenter can influence a participant to exhibit a certain behavior. Rosenthal and Fode provided evidence for this through a now highly renowned study. The participants were experimental psychology students, each of whom was given a group of five rats, which they were supposed to teach to navigate a maze to reach the darker of two platforms. Each participant was then told that they were either working with particularly bright or particularly dull rats, although there were no significant differences between any of the rats. At a later point, when the rats were tested on their ability to navigate the maze, those who had been randomly labeled as bright performed better than those who had been randomly labeled as dull. The students working with the rats had been biased by these labels. This caused them to treat the rats differently, ultimately resulting in the animals conforming to their expectations in a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy. This early example of the effects of experimenter bias prompted further research on the subject and helped raise awareness for the effect among investigators.",
            "example1": "The classic example of the observer expectancy effect is the study of Clever Hans. Hans wasnt your typical participant, mostly because he wasnt human. Hans was a horse living in Germany in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. What earned him the title of Clever were his owners claims that he had near-human intelligence. Hans and his owner, Wilhelm von Osten, gave several performances, in which Hans displayed his many impressive abilities. He was seemingly able to perform basic arithmetic, identify colors, read, and recognize musical notes.3",
            "example2": "While the experimenter expectancy effect is usually used in the context of research, it can also be applied to classroom settings; while teachers are not experimenters, they do administer tests to their students. Rosenthal and Fode showed that when university students believed the rats they were teaching to be dull, the rats performed more poorly on the maze task than the rats labeled as bright  even though the dull and bright labels were given randomly.7Similar effects can be seen in classroom settings. Whether based on comments from past teachers, report cards from previous years, or observed schoolyard behavior, a teacher may expect a certain student to either fail or excel in their course. As a result, teachers may consciously or unconsciously treat students differently. This may influence the students to behave in ways that align with their teachers expectations, even though they may have otherwise performed differently. Unfortunately, this means that children with poor academic records may not be given the chance to improve, while children with excellent academic records may struggle with the pressure of living up to their teachers high expectations."

Medical data proves these fears to be negligible. In the 1970s Britain, there was a decline in pertussis vaccinations that resulted in a major increase in cases and pertussis related deaths.

Instead of dealing with the situation, we bury our heads in the sand, like ostriches. This avoidance can often make things worse, incurring costs that we might not have had to pay if we had faced things head-on.",
            "individual_effect": "The ostrich effect was coined by behavioral economists to describe the behavior of investors, but it can crop up in pretty much any area of life, from personal finance, to project management, to health. And its more pervasive than many people may realize. According to one poll, almost half of US adults dont know the annual interest rates on their credit cards,1while another study found that 20% of people enrolled in a weight loss program had never weighed themselves before.2",
            "systematic_effect": "The ostrich effect can be a serious drawback to tackling societal problems, such as climate change. Because its so overwhelming to contemplate the severity and complexity of these issues, its often easier for elected officials to just ignore them entirely, and to reject information that contradicts their official stance.",
            "reason": "The ostrich effect has a couple of different meanings, depending on the context. In finance, this bias was coined to describe a specific pattern of investor behavior. Some investors were apparently sometimes more willing to make investments if the level of risk associated with it was unreported, compared to similar investments with established risk.3In psychology, however, the ostrich effect usually refers specifically to peoples reluctance to get feedback on their performance, even though that information would help them to monitor their progress and successfully work towards their goals.2",
            "neccessity": "Many studies, across many different fields, have found evidence of the ostrich effect at work. The temptation to bury our heads in the sand is probably greatest when the stakes are highwhich also, unfortunately, means that the ostrich effect can have very serious consequences, both at the individual and societal levels.",
            "avoid": "Though it can be tempting to run away from constructive criticism, in the long run, were almost always better off knowing where we stand and how we can improve. Although it may take a little determination, its definitely possible to get around the ostrich effect.",
            "started": "The ostrich effect was first coined by Israeli economists Dan Galai and Orly Sade, in a 2006 paper about investor behavior. They named it based on the common (and, disappointingly, untrue) belief that ostriches try to avoid predators by just sticking their heads into the sand.",
            "example1": "Receiving constructive criticism from coworkers and superiors is an important element of any job, and essential for employees to improve in their work. However, because of the ostrich effect, many employees dont seek out feedback, hurting both themselves and their organizations.",
            "example2": "Many people care about the problem of climate change, but given the complexity of the problem, its difficult to know how to address it. Unfortunately, research has found that feeling unknowledgeable about an issue can give rise to the ostrich effect, especially when the problem is urgent."

            "individual_effect": "The overjustification effect is an undesirable cognitive phenomenon. It can cause us to abandon activities that we actually find intrinsically valuable once we are presented with a prize or money for doing the activity. Instead of the rewards adding value to the activity, they take away from it. Consider the saying, money cant buy you happiness. The overjustification effect captures this belief by suggesting that intrinsic motivation and enjoyment is diminished by money.",
            "systematic_effect": "Motivation is hugely important, especially in todays society where we are bombarded with endless options for how to spend our time. Being motivated to perform a task often improves performance; therefore, it is important for companies and leaders to understand how best to motivate people. Without being intrinsically motivated, people can lose sight of why they want to partake in an activity. This can lead to people quitting their jobs, giving up on school, and casting aside their passions. Lacking motivation can also be a contributor to depression, and in turn, ends up being a barrier to overcoming depression too.3",
            "reason": "There are a number of reasons as to why the overjustification effect exists. Important to many theories is the idea that as humans, we arent necessarily the best at figuring out what motivates our decisions and our behavior.4When an extrinsic motivator is presented, we come to believe that it is the only reason we are performing an activity. This may occur because of the self-perception theory, which states that we learn about our likes and dislikes by observing our own behavior.4We understand our motivationafteran activity has occurred. If we complete a task for its intrinsic value, we observe that we chose to do the task. Alternatively, if we complete a task and are rewarded for it after the fact, we will come to believe we only did it for the reward.4",

However, being aware of the overjustification effect does not help us to not be influenced by extrinsic motivators once they are presented to us. Additionally, money as a motivator cannot be wholly ignored, because we need to earn a decent wage to pay for things like food and rent.",

Deci was curious about how external rewards affected intrinsic motivation, as a number of psychologists had suggested that extrinsic motivation causes intrinsic motivation to diminish.",

Through their notable study conducted in 1993, titled When More Pain is Preferred to Less: Adding a Better End, the researchers found that the human memory seldom records series of events with accuracy, thus giving evidence to the influence of the peak-end rule in our memory processes.13",

Many decisions that include a component of potential downside may be nullified due to an overestimation of such a downside.

Both biases can indeed coexist in a population as cognitive phenomena since not every bias applies to every person. Moreover, both biases can also coexist for the same person, depending on the context of the situation (more on that later). In general, however, most people skew towards expressing an optimism bias. For example, the majority of people expect to live longer and be healthier than others.4",

            "avoid": "Although advice on dealing with depression is beyond the scope of this piece, we can suggest trying to consider future events from a more logical perspective rather than letting your intuition prepare for the worst, as a way to combat the pessimism bias. If the forecast calls for 40% chance of rain on the day of your hike, is it reasonable to conclude that its probably going to rain? Probably not.",
            "started": "The history of the pessimism bias starts with the history of pessimism. Derived from the Latin word pessimus, meaning worst, early use of the term predominantly applied to philosophical doctrines that emphasized the evils of life.",

Alloy and Ahrens found that participants overall were more likely to expect others to succeed rather than fail, however this was less likely to be the case among depressed individuals.

Studies have shown that we can be primed to behave in certain manners based on things we have read, watched, and heard. The professor John Bargh demonstrated the effects of priming by having different students unscramble sentences that reflected aggression, patience, and positivity. After they finished unscrambling their sentences, they were made to wait for Bargh to check their answers. Bargh found that the students who were given the sentences about aggression to unscramble became the most frustrated at the waiting time to have their answers checked. The students who were given the sentences about patience and positivity, however, were the least frustrated when waiting to have their answers checked.

For companies with recognizable brands, the priming effect can be used to exploit how people think in order to have them buy more company products. Indeed, companies can activate or bring certain associations forward into the memory of consumers to make them more receptive to the product the company wishes to sell. This process is called a behavioral pump and can dramatically influence consumer decision-making. Without an awareness of how the priming effect impacts their purchasing habits, consumers can fall victim to the marketing techniques of big companies.",
            "reason": "Psychologists have found that unitsalso referred to as schemasof information are stored in our long-term memory.2 These schemas can be activated by sights, smells, and sounds. When these schemas are activated, our memories become easier to access. Priming suggests that certain schemas are activated in unison, which in turn leads related or connected units of information to be activated at the same time. Once related schemas are activated and more accessible, it becomes easier for us to draw related information into memory more quickly, and we can thus respond faster when the need arises. For example, the schemas related to rainstorms and slick roads may be linked in our memories. As a result, when we drive and it is raining, the memory of slick roads comes to mind, leading us to slow down and take precaution.",

With an awareness of the priming effect, we can remain conscious of how previous experiences may influence our present decision-making.",

Indeed, researchers have explored how the priming effect can incite positive changes in our emotions, behaviours, and general thought processes.",

Since the early 1980s, researchers have studied priming by considering how the exposure to certain types of information can influence how we behave and think. The earliest work on priming focused on how exposure to specific primes altered social impressions, as well as how they affected emotions and other mental processes. Among the earliest researchers to approach the topic of priming were Bargh and Pietromonaco in 1982, Fazio et al. in 1983, and Smith and Branscomb in 1987.5",

In the study, consumers were primed with words representing either high-end retail brands or low-cost ones. In a later task, the consumers were found to have a stronger preference for products of the high-end brands if they had been exposed to the brands name during the priming stage. For example, if a study participant had been primed with words representing a high-end retail brand such as Gucci, this participant would be more likely later on to have a preference for the brand.",

However, being aware of the projection bias might help us avoid situations where we know the projection bias occurs, to avoid sub-optimal outcomes. Loewenstein, ODonoghue and Rabin suggested the model of a sophisticated projection bias to describe these kinds of situations, using the example of a sophisticated grocery shopper who knows not to shop on an empty stomach because they are aware of the projection bias, either from experience or from knowledge of cognitive biases.1Even though awareness of the projection bias alone cannot change our cognitive processes, it can lead to the implementation of certain rules, like not going grocery shopping on an empty stomach, that are useful in ensuring our short-term decisions lead to long-term happiness.",

It might be the beginning of the work week when we are feeling well-rested and motivated. We mistakenly assume that we will continue to feel well-rested and motivated as we continue to work on the task, and will continue to work at the same level.

            "individual_effect": "Regret aversion occurs via fear of either commission or omission.1 In other words, it is the prospect of committing to a failure or omitting an opportunity that we seek to avoid. The concern of committing to a failure, for example, such as making a bad investment, can loom over ones preferences. People sometimes think less about making a good decision and more about avoiding a bad one. This anticipation of regret over making the wrong choice is often factored into our decision-making as a form of emotional insurance.",
            "systematic_effect": "If regret aversion can occur among individual investors, it can, in turn, impact the broader financial market. Investors may buy a stock because they dont want to regret missing out on the opportunity, or they might sell a stock prematurely because they dont want to regret having committed to holding. These decisions can in turn affect the price of a stock. Overbidding in auctions, for example, is a result of bidders considering regret in addition to profit and driving the price up, which has been attributed to regret aversion.3",
            "reason": "Support for the emotional component of regret aversion can be found in neuroscientific studies, which suggest that anticipated regrets powerful influence on future decisions is a function of our emotional pathways in the brain. One study associated regret aversion with increased activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala,4 a connection that is believed to be highly involved in emotional processing.5",
            "neccessity": "Regret aversion is likely to be even stronger in decisions with significant consequences. While we may factor in regret when choosing between menu items at a restaurant, this regret will likely not loom as much as the potential regret over choosing the wrong house. This makes regret aversion a non-trivial bias, as it can impact high stakes decisions.",
            "avoid": "One particular study found that people often overestimate future regret,9 which suggests that individuals are less susceptible to regret than they may believe. This is an interesting finding to keep in mind when considering a decision where potential regret is influencing our preferences, where we can note that it may not be as likely as we think.",
            "started": "A number of studies emerged in the early 80s suggesting a role of regret in traditional economic theory. In 1982 for example, Graham Loomes and Robert Sugden published Regret Theory: an Alternative Theory of Rational Choice under Uncertainty.10 They noted how the basic axioms that underlie classic economic models, such as expected utility theory, dont always align with human behavior.",
            "example1": "Have you ever heard someone say they have bad FOMO? Sometimes what they are saying, essentially, is that they are highly susceptible to regret aversion. FOMO often occurs when people make a decision out of a fear of missing out on the opportunity, as they might regret their decision at a later date.",

            "reason": "The representativeness heuristic was coined by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, two of the most influential figures in behavioral economics. The classic example used to illustrate this bias asks the reader to consider Steve, whom an acquaintance has described as very shy and withdrawn, invariably helpful, but with little interest in people, or in the world of reality. A meek and tidy soul, he has a need for order and structure, and a passion for detail. After reading a description of Steve, do you think its more likely that Steve is a librarian, or a farmer?2Intuitively, most of us feel like Steve must be a librarian because hes morerepresentativeof our image of a librarian than he is our image of a farmer.",
            "neccessity": "The representativeness heuristic is a very pervasive bias, and many researchers believe it is the foundation of several other biases and heuristics that affect our processing. One example is the conjunction fallacy, which occurs when we assume that it is more likely for multiple things to co-occur than it is for a single thing to happen on its own. Statistically speaking, this is never true.",
            "avoid": "Because categorization is so fundamental to our perception of the world, it is very difficult to completely avoid the representativeness heuristic. However, being aware of it is a good start: research has shown that when people become aware that they are using a heuristic, they often correct their judgment.10Pointing out other peoples reliance on representativeness, and asking them to do the same for you, provides useful feedback that might help to avoid bias.",
            "started": "While its a staple of modern psychology, the concept of sorting objects into categories can actually be traced all the way back to the Ancient Greeks philosophers. While Plato first touched on categories in hisStatesmandialogue, it became a philosophical mainstay of his student, Aristotle, who, in a text simply calledCategories, aimed to sort every object of human apprehension into one of ten categories.",
            "example1": "Stomach ulcers are a relatively common ailment, but they can be gravely serious if left untreated, resulting in deadly stomach cancer. For a long time, it was common knowledge that stomach ulcers were caused by one thing: stress. So in the 1980s, when an Australian physician named Barry Marshall suggested at a medical conference that ulcers might be caused by a kind of bacteria, his colleagues initially rejected it out of hand.11After being ignored, Marshall finally proved his suspicions using the only method ethically available to him: he took some of the bacteria of the gut of a sick patient, added it to a broth, and drank it himself. He soon developed a stomach ulcer, and other doctors were finally convinced.12",
            "example2": "Gilovich and Savitsky also argue that the representativeness heuristic plays a role in pseudoscientific beliefs, including astrology. In astrology, the various signs are all associated with certain traits: for example, Aries, a fire sign symbolized by the ram, is often said to be passionate, confident, impatient, and aggressive. The fact that this personality meshes well with the prototypical ram is no coincidence: as Gilovich and Savitsky argue, the personality types that are linked to each star sign were chosen because they are representative of that sign.11The predictions that are made by horoscopes, rather than foretelling the future, are reverse-engineered based on what best fits with our image of each sign."

This prevents us from taking time to self-reflect and think about how the topic being assessed is actually relevant to us. Not only is this a missed opportunity for critical thinking about oneself and ones actions, but, in the case of research, it results in the provision of inaccurate data.",
            "systematic_effect": "Researchers need to proceed with caution when designing surveys or structured interviews in order to minimize the likelihood of respondents committing response bias. If they fail to do so, this systematic error could be detrimental to the entire study. Instead of progressing knowledge, biased results can lead researchers to draw inaccurate conclusions, which can have wide implications. Research is expensive to conduct and the questions under investigation tend to be of importance. For these reasons, tremendous effort is required in research design to ensure that all findings are as accurate as possible.",
            "reason": "Response bias can occur for a variety of reasons. To categorize the possible causes, different forms of response bias have been defined.",

However, its not just researchers who need to understand this effect. Most of us have, or will go onto, participate in research of some kind, even if its as simple as filling out a quick online survey. By being aware of this bias, we can work on being more critical and honest in answering these kinds of questions, instead of responding automatically.",

Gove and Geerken claimed that response bias variables act largely as random noise,\" which doesnt significantly affect the results as long as the sample size is big enough.2 They werent the only researchers to try and quell concerns over this bias but, more recently, it has become increasingly recognized as a genuine source of concern in academia. This is due to the overwhelming amount of research that has come out supporting the presence of an effect, for example, Furnhams literature review.3Knuper and Wittchens 1994 study also demonstrates this bias, specifically, in the context of standardized diagnostic interviews administered to the elderly, who engage in a form of response bias by tending to attribute symptoms of depression to physical conditions.4",

This discrimination impairment wasnt observed when facial expressions were presented for a longer duration. On these longer trials, patients with major depression exhibited a response bias towards sad faces. Its important to note that discrimination impairment and response bias did not occur simultaneously, so its clear that one cant be attributed to the other.",

Maybe we pledge to become vegetarians after watching an impactful documentary, but later find ourselves unable to resist the bacon cheeseburger on a restaurant menu. Or maybe we frequently smoke cigarettes but believe that we can easily quit at any time. Temptation is powerful, and often we inaccurately gauge the power it has over us. This exaggerated view of our own restraint can cause us to make poor decisions and put ourselves in scenarios where our restraint is tested. We then have a greater chance of slipping and going against our prior commitments.",

Research on the transformative ability of emotion also has provided insight into the psychological mechanisms of the restraint bias. Behavioral scientist George Loewenstein found that we have a general inability to predict our own wants and behaviors in future states, especially in different affective states.4He refers to this discrepancy as theempathy gap.",

It is universal to act impulsively at times, or let our emotions and urges push us towards behaving in ways we otherwise wouldnt. However, when we repeatedly overestimate our restraint and fail to take measures to limit our temptation, there can be life-shaping consequences. This tendency can severely affect our health by encouraging unhealthy eating, drug use, smoking, and more. It can impact our relationships by nudging us towards infidelity or rash decisions. It can even affect our finances, as we give in to temptations of spending and gambling. In its strongest form, the restraint bias can push us back into cycles of addiction. Overall, matters of restraint are no small thing.",

Basically, how well we know ourselves can improve our choices and behaviors.",

Working off of Loewensteins empathy gap research, they proposed that people have a tendency to overestimate their capacity for impulse control and coined this phenomenon the restraint bias.1They tested this hypothesis through four experiments on impulse-control beliefs surrounding fatigue, hunger, and smoking/addiction.",
            "example1": "We all know what it is like to go grocery shopping while we are hungry. Often our eyes are bigger than our stomachs and we purchase an overabundance of food or items we normally wouldnt. Clearly different levels of hunger yield different choices.

            "reason": "Rosy retrospection is a product of how our brains process memory over time. One reason that older adults have a more rosy picture of the past, which for them is young adulthood, may be because those time periods coincide with more emotionally salient memories. Known as the reminiscence bump, the most vivid long-term memories are often sourced from the ages between 10-30, with a concentration of memories of personal events occurring during ones 20s,3 when many of lifes significant moments occur.",
            "neccessity": "Rosy retrospection is a reminder that what is vivid in memory is not always true. Our beliefs about the world, about the past, and about present-day society guide our decisions and preferences for the future. Although time machines dont actually exist, a misguided preference for the good old days can have significant consequences in organizational and political domains, as decisions regarding the future are often a function of some evaluation made in or of the past.",
            "avoid": "Though it can be very challenging to counter a sense of feeling that something is true, debiasing rosy retrospection requires a certain aspect of conscious deliberation. It is always helpful to question and challenge ones own opinions and evaluations. For example, before standing by the opinion that they simply dont make cartoons like they used to, perhaps I should consider such a claim in light of the cognitive processes highlighted here. It might not be the case that cartoons arent as great today as they were in the past, but rather my recollection of the cartoons of the past coincides with fond childhood experiences of watching those films. Additionally, while today I can easily point to examples of movies I think are poor, it would be more difficult to do the same for several years ago as Im less likely to have vivid memories of cartoons that I didnt care about. This doesnt mean that those cartoons that were out of taste didnt exist back then however. Acknowledging these tendencies can put a brake on an excessive rose-tinted perspective.",

In addition to the rose-tinted view of past events, they also suggested a tendency for people to anticipate future events as more favorable than they describe them to actually be during the time of occurrence. In 1997, the researchers published experimental support for their theory,9 where cyclists expressed rosy accounts of a grueling bike tour and vacationers recalled a holiday more fondly a few months later compared to shortly after the vacation.",

For example, businesses often run into planning errors and delays because of a failure to account for less salient aspects of their operations such as administrative tasks or other ancillary steps that must be taken. The salience bias can also be considered a crucial obstacle for environmental protection and climate change mitigation efforts.

It can be the result of a number of emotional or cognitive factors, not necessarily from some physical feature that someone can clearly see. The salience bias commonly develops as a result of a psychological process such as cognitive ease, it can occur over time as we become accustomed to prominent features in our day-to-day lives, and it can also appear simply because our individual interests draw us toward specific aspects of the world.",

Afterwards, Taylor and Fiske asked the people from the circle to attribute cause for several incidents. The people attributed more cause to the people whose faces they could see better. As a result, Taylor and Fiske were able to determine that the salience of certain factors can influence what people see, hear, and decide. This experiment, among others, represents one of the first measurements of the salience bias.",

In less academic terms: since men dont have to go through the laborious journey of child-rearing in order to pass their DNA along, theyre naturally inclined to be more attentive to the possibility of sex as its less costly for them to replicate their genes than it is for women.",

If you had seen a woman hold the door and smile for another man, would you really wager that shes seducing him? As the colloquial antidote to vanity goes: Dont flatter yourself.",

Perilloux and colleagues found the usual effect: that the men overestimated the womens sexual interest while the women underestimated it. Interestingly, they found that the magnitude of mens overperception was related to a womans physical attractiveness. In other words, men were more likely to think a woman was into them when they thought that woman was attractive."

Once identifying areas that were in the worst condition, they would then reinforce the aircrafts with more protection in those locations.

            "individual_effect": "Although these memory lapses seem rather innocuous, the ramifications of the telescoping effect can be significant. Consider a casual investor who may mistime the market because of misperceptions of when certain events actually took place. This person might think back to an interview they watched on Bloomberg, where a guest was talking about a promising stock thats undervalued. It feels like just last week they watched this interview, and they decide to buy the stock. It turns out however, that the interview was actually three months ago and much of the hype has already been priced into the stock.",
            "systematic_effect": "Systemic telescoping can greatly affect market research. Many surveys that are used to make key decisions in business, politics, and science, rely on survey data that often ask respondents something like: In the past six months, how often have you?... Under the scenario where a number of respondents succumbed to the telescoping effect in their recollections, organizations may be making decisions or inputting forecasts based on inaccurate data.",
            "reason": "One theory behind the telescoping effect is the accessibility principle, where time perceptions regarding certain events depend on how accessible information is for that event.3 The more that is known and easily accessed in immediate memory, the more recent it seems. 9/11 for example, is a very salient memory for many people, as they can often vividly recall what they were doing at the time and how they felt. This level of accessibility results in forward telescoping by creating a feeling that the event was fairly recent. On the other hand, after an eventful weekend, we might say on Monday that Friday feels like forever ago, with such backward telescoping stemming from a more congested short-term memory where all the things that happened on the weekend blur recollection of Friday, making it less accessible.",
            "neccessity": "Decisions where knowing the elapsed time is a key factor can be subjected to bias from the telescoping effect. Mitigating the reliance on inaccurate assessments of time will strengthen decision-making and add clarity to the subject at hand. Furthermore, while the telescoping effect highlights our own potential risks when recalling when events had occurred, it is also a critical element to consider in data collection that relies on self-report responses subject to perceptions of time.",
            "avoid": "When making predictions of the future based on events of the past, its important to actually look at the numbers. For example, if an R&D manager believes their team should explore new features to match a competitor who has been launching a lot of new features recently, it would help to reference the data on exactly when these features were launched and base decisions going forward on concrete information rather than intuition.",
            "started": "In 1868, long before cognitive biases were uncovered, the German physiologist Karl von Vierordt published Der Zeitsinn nach Versuchen (The Experimental Study of the Time Sense), a book reporting a number of experiments on the psychology of time perception. From this 19th century piece of scientific literature emerged Vierordts Law: That people tend to underestimate the length of long time intervals while overestimating the length of short ones.",
            "example1": "There is a breadth of research in the telescoping realm that explores an effect within the age of onset for the use of recreational substances such as drugs and alcohol. For example, one study found a forward telescoping effect among cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana users.6 The longitudinal data set, collected in waves over 8 years, found consistent self-reporting of the age of onset in only a third of marijuana users, with even less consistency among alcohol and cigarette users.",
            "example2": "We hear this phrase in a variety of settings: when one is graduating college and thinks back to their first day of class; on an anniversary and a couple recalls their wedding day; during a milestone event for a child and a parent thinks back to when they were a baby."

            "definition": "The illusion of explanatory depth (IOED) describes our belief that we understand more about the world than we actually do. It is often not until we are asked to actually explain a concept that we come face to face with our limited understanding of it.",
            "individual_effect": "Theillusion of explanatory depth can cause you to make important decisions based on limited information, as you consistently believe you have much more information to work with than you actually do. As a result of limited but convincing information, you may become passionate and excited about a new concept. Perhaps you discover a new cause you choose to support, or a new class youre suddenly excited about pursuing. When asked to explain the cause you are fighting for or the class for which you are signing up, however, you may find yourself stumped for words. In these cases, your decisions and inklings are often based on feelings more than deep thoughts, evident by your weak ability to explain them. If you consistently make choices by way of your immediate feelings, toward goals or causes you cant explain in depth and dont fully understand, you might find your values misrepresented by your life choices.",
            "systematic_effect": "On the whole, people far too often hold strong opinions about topics for which they have limited information, causing social and political movements to have plenty of people behind them with limited ideas of what they are even fighting for. In fact, studies show that those who are more passionate about a certain cause actually often know less about it. When cognitive scientist Phil Fernbach and his colleagues asked a scientific question about genetically modified foods to a group full of people and then asked them how strongly they were for or against genetically modified foods, he found that those who got the scientific question wrong were often more passionate about whichever side they supported.",
            "reason": "Change blindness is the human tendency to miss changes in appearance when the change is disrupted by other visual stimuli. For example, if you see an image of a bike, then suddenly you see something else, you will not notice if the image of the bike returns looking slightly different than before.",
            "neccessity": "The illusion of explanatory depth is important because it shows the ignorance on which many aspects of society are based, and the false pretenses under which so much division exists. While many people think they are experts in certain fields, when asked to explain their views, they often fall silent. The illusion of explanatory depth shows us that more explanationand less reason giving and argumentcan help our society build consensus, understanding, and deeper knowledge.",
            "avoid": "Next time you learn about something new, ask yourself to explain the concept out loud to yourself or to someone else before you develop a strong opinion on it. Take questions from other people, or predict what their questions may be. As you do so, keep digging for answers, and dont close yourself off from discovering more information. Unfortunately, the most well-informed people are less passionate about topics, since they understand well the many sides and factors at play. Before your own passion clouds your understanding and turns into a hateful post on Facebook, practice explaining concepts out loud and spotting gaps in your own knowledge.",
            "started": "The illusion of explanatory depth was coined in 2002 by Yale researchers Leonid Rozenblit and Frank Keil. In their experiment, Rozenblit and Keil asked Yale undergraduate students to rate their understanding of everyday items like sewing machines, cell phones, and zippers. They then asked subjects to write a detailed explanation of how each item works and then re-rate their own knowledge on these items. Confronted with the limitations of their own understandings, participants consistently scored themselves much lower than they had before writing these explanations. In their paper, The Misunderstood Limits of Folk Science: An Illusion of Explanatory Depth, Rozenblit and Keil concluded that having to explain basic concepts helps people realize that they dont know all they think they do.",

That means that individuals who dont believe that others have high expectations of themselves may suffer as a result. The Pygmalion effect demonstrates that stereotypes may be more damaging than they seem.",
            "reason": "The Pygmalion effect is a psychological phenomenon that describes how expectations can modify behavior. It provides evidence for the self-fulfilling prophecy, which is based on the idea that others beliefs about us become true because their belief impacts how we behave.2The Pygmalion effect specifically describes situations in which superiors positive opinions on performance will lead to better performance actually occurring.",

            "started": "The Pygmalion effect got its name from the Greek myth of Pygmalion. Pygmalion was a sculptor who carved a statue of a beautiful woman that he later fell in love with. He wished that he could find a woman as beautiful as his sculpture to marry. Aphrodite, the goddess of love, granted his wish and turned his sculpture into a woman. Pygmalions fixation on the sculpture allowed it to come to life, just as our focus on an expectation can impact the outcome in a given situation.3",
            "example1": "While Rosenthal and Jacobson demonstrated a difference in performance between students who had been labelled as intellectual bloomers and a control group of students that were not, the Pygmalion effect could have occurred not because teachers thought positively about the intellectual bloomers, but because they thought negatively about the control group.2",

However, Dr. Hakan Jenner, a professor of pedagogy with a focus on youth substance abuse, believed it also could impact treatment, as therapists can also have expectations about their patients success.7"

            "individual_effect": "In economic terms, sunk costs are costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered.1 In the previous example, the $50 spent on concert tickets would not be recovered whether or not you attended the concert. It therefore should not be a factor in our current decision-making, because it is irrational to use irrecoverable costs as a rationale for making a present decision. If we acted rationally, only future costs and benefits would be taken into account, because regardless of what we have already invested, we will not get it back whether or not we follow through on the decision.",
            "systematic_effect": "The sunk cost fallacy not only has an impact on small day-to-day decisions like attending a concert. It also has been proven to impact the decisions that governments and companies make.",
            "reason": "The sunk cost fallacy occurs because we are not purely rational decision-makers and are often influenced by our emotions. When we have previously invested in a choice, we are likely to feel guilty or regretful if we do not follow through on that decision. The sunk cost fallacy is associated with the commitment bias, where we continue to support our past decisions despite new evidence suggesting that it isnt the best course of action.",
            "neccessity": "As can be seen by the various examples discussed in this article, the sunk cost fallacy impacts many aspects of our daily life, as well as bigger decisions that have long-term effects. The sunk cost fallacy means that we are making decisions that are irrational and lead to suboptimal outcomes. We are focused on our past investments instead of our present and future costs and benefits, meaning that we commit ourselves to decisions that are no longer in our best interests.",
            "avoid": "While it is difficult to overcome inherent cognitive fallacies, if we are aware of the sunk cost fallacy, we can try to ensure we are focusing on current and future costs and benefits instead of past commitments. We should focus on concrete actions instead of the feeling of wastefulness or guilt that accompanies dropping an earlier commitment, as studies have shown that when we are deterred from making decisions based on our emotions, the effects of the sunk cost fallacy are reduced5.",
            "started": "Behavioral scientists and economists are constantly trying to understand the reasons why we make irrational decisions. Richard Thaler, a pioneer of behavioral science, first introduced the sunk cost fallacy, suggesting that paying for the right to use a good or service will increase the rate at which the good will be utilized (1980, pp. 47).7",

            "individual_effect": "This favorability in eliminating risk can directly impact decision-making in regard to probabilistic events. In one study, when people were asked if they prefer the option to decrease a given risk from 5% to 0% or to decrease a risk from 50% to 25%, they opted for the former, despite the drop from 50% to 25% being a far greater reduction in risk.1",

Some of the hypotheticals in the literature include preferences over policies towards terrorism, gun violence, and traffic accidents. Public pressures to strive for zero risk may push policymakers away from prioritizing overall risk reduction.",
            "reason": "Like many cognitive biases, the zero risk bias is a mental shortcut. The common narrative behind these shortcuts is that they reduce cognitive strain. Instead of having to calculate the optimal solution, something that would require a lot of time and energy, we opt for the choice with less effort and uncertainty.",
            "neccessity": "Decision-making under risk and uncertainty is a vast arena present in public health, financial markets, political strategy, security, and business management. Decisions within these domains can have serious consequences, so balancing a public desire for certainty with the real optimal option can be a delicate act. Not only is acknowledging the zero risk bias relevant to an individuals thought process, but also to how we might expect such decisions to be perceived by others.",
            "avoid": "While its not always easy to stop and think about what a rational actor would do, it helps to assess your decision-making process and see how much fear or the emotional salience of a potential loss is guiding your preference towards a particular choice. Probe yourself on how much the allure of zero risk is influencing your preferences and whether its really more important than a greater reduction in risk.",
            "started": "Although there are earlier findings showing a preference for certainty over overall risk reduction such as Prospect Theory, the zero risk bias as a unique cognitive phenomenon is often attributed to a 1987 paper published by Kip Viscusi, Wesley Magat, and Joel Hubert.4 The researchers found evidence for certainty premiums in eliminating risk by asking participants how much they would pay to reduce the possible risk of side effects from cleaning products (insecticide and toilet bowl cleaner). Viscusi and colleagues found people were willing to pay up to three times as much to reduce the risk of side effects from 5/15,000 cases to 0/15,000, as they were for a risk reduction from 15/15,000 to 10/15,000, despite the reductions in risk essentially being statistically negligible.",
