            "desc": "The Aardvark (Orycteropus afer) (\u2018Digging foot\u2019), sometimes called \u2018antbear\u2019 is a medium-sized mammal native to Africa. The name comes from the Afrikaans/Dutch for \u2018earth pig\u2019, because early settlers from Europe thought it resembled a pig. However, the aardvark is not related to the pig, it is placed in its own order. The Aardvark is also not related to the South American anteater, despite sharing some characteristics and a similar resemblance. The closest living relatives of the aardvark are the elephant shrews (small insectivorous mammals native to Africa), the sirenians (herbivorous mammals that inhabit rivers), hyraxes (herbivorous mammals that live in Africa and the Middle East), tenrecs (a family of mammals found on Madagascar and parts of Africa) and elephants. One of the most distinctive characteristics of the aardvark is their teeth. Instead of having a pulp cavity in their tooth, they have a number of thin tubes of dentine (a calcified tissue of the body), each containing pulp held together by cementum (a specialized calcified substance covering the root of a tooth). The teeth have no enamel coating and are worn away and regrow continuously. The Aardvark is born with conventional incisors and canines at the front of the jaw, which fall out and are not replaced. Adult Aardvarks only have cheek teeth at the back of the jaw.",
            "characteristics": "One of the most distinctive characteristics of the aardvark is their teeth. Instead of having a pulp cavity in their tooth, they have a number of thin tubes of dentine (a calcified tissue of the body), each containing pulp held together by cementum (a specialized calcified substance covering the root of a tooth). The teeth have no enamel coating and are worn away and regrow continuously. The Aardvark is born with conventional incisors and canines at the front of the jaw, which fall out and are not replaced. Adult Aardvarks only have cheek teeth at the back of the jaw.The Aardvark is vaguely pig-like. Its body is stout with an arched back and is sparsely covered with coarse hairs. The limbs are of moderate length. The front feet have lost the pollex (or \u2018thumb\u2019), resulting in four toes, however, the rear feet have all five toes.Aardvarks have shovel-shaped claws for digging. Their ears are disproportionately long and the tail is very thick at the base and gradually tapers. Their greatly elongated head is set on a short, thick neck and the end of the snout bears a disc, which houses the nostrils. Their mouth is small and tubular, typical of species that feed on termites. The aardvark has a long, thin, protruding tongue (as long as 30 centimetres) and elaborate structures supporting a keen sense of smell. Of all living mammals, the aardvark has the largest number of turbinate bones in its nasal cavity.The aardvarks cone-shaped tail is short and tapered, smaller at the end. The long tongue is sticky to help catch insects. Adult aardvarks are 67 to 79 inches (170 to 200 centimetres) long and weigh anywhere from 88 to 143 pounds (40 to 65 kilograms). The aardvark is pale yellowish grey in color and often stained reddish-brown by soil. The aardvarks coat is thin and the animals primary protection is its tough skin. The aardvark has been known to sleep in recently excavated ant nests, which also serve as protection. The number of aardvarks has nearly doubled since 2002.",
            "behaviour": "The Aardvark is a nocturnal mammal and is a solitary creature that feeds almost exclusively on ants and termites. The only fruit eaten by aardvarks is the aardvark cucumber. An aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset and forages over a considerable home range covering 10 to 30 kilometres, swinging its long nose from side to side to pick up the scent of food. When a concentration of ants or termites is detected, the Aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs, keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators such as lions, leopards, hyenas and pythons.The aardvark takes up an astonishing number of insects with its long, sticky tongue, as many as 50,000 in one night. It is an exceptionally fast digger, but otherwise moves fairly slowly. The aardvarks claws enable it to dig through the extremely hard crust of a termite/ant mound quickly, avoiding the dust by sealing the nostrils. When successful, the aardvarks long (as long as 30 centimetres) tongue licks up the insects. The termitess stinging attacks are ineffective because of the aardvarks tough skin.Apart from digging out ants and termites, the aardvark also excavates burrows in which to live. Temporary sites are scattered around their home range as refuges and a main burrow is used for breeding. Main burrows can be deep and extensive, have several entrances and can be as long as 13 metres.The Aardvark changes the layout of its home burrow regularly and from time to time moves on and makes a new one. The old burrows are then inhabited by smaller animals such as the African Wild Dog. Only mothers and cubs share burrows. If attacked in the tunnel, the aardvark will seal the tunnel off behind itself or turn around and attack with its claws.",
            "habitat": "Aardvarks live in Sub saharan Africa, where there is suitable habitat for them to live, such as savannas, grasslands, woodlands and bush land and available food (ants and termites). Aardvarks are sometimes found in rainforests and are absent from desert regions. The deciding factor for where aardvarks live is availability of food.Aardvarks also require sandy soil, as opposed to rocks, so that they can dig for termites and ants. Aardvarks live in underground burrows that are 6.5 to 9.8 feet (2 to 3 metres) long, at 45 degree angles. At the end of the tunnel is a rounded \u2018room\u2019 where the aardvark curls up to sleep. Female aardvarks give birth in this chamber. Although burrows usually have just one entrance, some have numerous entrances as well as several tunnels extending from the main passage.",
            "diet": "Aardvarks can consume about 50,000 insects in one night. Aardvarks began eating termites and ants thirty-five million years ago and they are still their preferred meal. A hill of termites or ants is not enough to satisfy an aardvark, however, so it searches for entire termite and ant colonies. These colonies march in columns 33 to 130 feet (10 to 40 metres) long, which makes it easy for the aardvark to suck the termites/ants through its nostrils. When attacking a termite/ant mound, the aardvark starts digging at the base with his front claws. Once the termites/ants begin escaping, it extends its tongue and traps them with its sticky saliva. Aardvarks also eat locusts and a type of grasshopper.",
            "reproduction": "The mating season of the aardvark varies. In some areas, mating occurs between April and May, with offspring born in October or November. In other regions, offspring are born in May or June. Females carry their offspring for 7 months before giving birth to one cub with each pregnancy. The cub weighs approximately 4 pounds (2 kilograms).Newborn aardvarks are hairless with pink, tender skin. They remain in the burrow with their mothers for two weeks. After two weeks they follow their mothers in the nightly search for food. The aardvark cub does not eat solid food until around 3 months, preferring its mothers milk until that time. The cub begins eating termites at 14 weeks and is weaned by 16 weeks. At 6 months of age it is able to dig its own burrows, but it will often remain with the mother until the next mating season. The cub reaches sexually maturity the season after that.Male aardvarks leave their mothers completely during the next mating season, but females stay with mothers until the birth of the next cub. Male aardvarks roam while females remain in a consistent home range. Because of this, experts believe aardvarks to be polygamous (puh-LIH-guh-mus), having more than one mating partner.Aardvarks can live to be over 24 years old in captivity. In the wild, they live between 10 \u2013 23 years.",
            "predators": "The aardvarks main predators are lions, leopards, hunting dogs and pythons. Aardvarks can dig fast or run in zigzag fashion to elude enemies, but if all else fails, they will strike with their claws, tail and shoulders, sometimes flipping onto their backs to lash with all fours. Their thick skin also protects them to some extent.",
            "conservation": "The 2002 South African IUCN red list places the aardvark in the least concern category. It was previously considered vulnerable but this was almost certainly the result of its elusive behaviour, making it difficult to see and and appear uncommon. In other southern African countries their status is probably least concern as well, but in central and east Africa, their status is less well documented. The most important factor in controlling aardvark populations is the abundance and distribution of their prey, ants and termites.Another limiting factor is soil type (very shallow soils might restrict their range). Loss of habitat as a result of increasing human populations and possibly hunting (for traditional medicine and bush meat) are probably their greatest threats. In some areas they cause problems for farmers, whereby they dig under fences or digs holes in roads or farm dam walls. In such areas persecution of aardvarks may occur. Fortunately for aardvarks the threat of hunting is reduced by their nocturnal habits, which make them difficult animals to catch.Find out more about animals that begin with the letter A"

            "image": "https://animalcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/addax1-1-340x200.jpg",
            "desc": "The Addax, sometimes called the \u2018screw horn antelope\u2019, because of its twisted horns, is a large, desert dwelling member of the antelope family, closely related to the Oryx. The Addax is a critically endangered mammal which is found in several isolated areas in the sahara desert in Northern Africa. The Sahara is the worlds largest hot desert. The addax is extremely rare within its native habitat and with only 500 Addax left in the wild, this antelope could unfortunately, face extinction.",
            "description": "The head and body length of the addax measures 150 \u2013 170 centimetres (59.1 \u2013 66.9 inches). Males are slightly taller than females and measure 105 \u2013 114 centimetres (3.5 \u2013 3.8 feet) at the shoulder whereas females measure 93 \u2013 108 centimetres (3.1 \u2013 3.6 feet) at the shoulder. Males weigh between 99 \u2013 124 kilograms and females weigh 60 \u2013 125 kilograms.The coat of the addax varies in color depending on season. In winter their coat is a greyish brown color with white hind quarters and legs. During summer, their coat turns lighter, almost completely white or a sandy beige which helps to maintain body temperate as lighter colors reflect the heat more. They have black/brown tufts of hair on their tails.Both male and female addax have horns and a patch of brown hair on their foreheads which forms an \u2018X\u2019 shape over their nose. Their horns have 2 \u2013 3 twists and can reach a length of 120 centimetres in males and 80 centimetres in females. Between the horns are long, black hairs that end in a short mane on their necks.Addax have short, thick legs and wide, flat hooves with flat soles which help prevent them from sinking into the sand. The addax walks by throwing its wide-hoofed feet sideways to avoid brushing against the opposite limb, but places one foot behind the other, leaving a single line of tracks. The animal runs in a flat gallop and appears stiff-kneed, due to minimal leg flexing while running. It is considered one of the slowest runners of the antelopes, perhaps reflecting its adaptation to sandy terrain.The addax differ from other species of antelope as they have large, square shaped teeth (like cows) and they lack the typical facial glands.\u00a0",
            "habitat": "The addax prefers sandy desert terrain and stony deserts, semi-desert and dry steppes. Addax rest during the day in deep depressions dug out in the sand often located near large boulders to shield them against the wind and hot sun.\u00a0",
            "diet": "The addax are herbivores and their diet consists of desert succulents, leaves, Aristida grasses, herbs, perennials and small bushes (if available). They also feed up on Parnicum grass whereby they will only eat the inner shoots and seeds and disregard the dry, outer leaves. These seeds provide adequate protein in the addax diet. Addax can survive without water as their thirst is satisfied by the moisture they obtain from the plants in their diet.\u00a0",
            "behaviour": "Addax are nocturnal animals and are adapted to extreme desert conditions. Some addax are able to live far from each other in their habitat, but this does not cause any problems because they have over developed sensory skills that enable them to detect and locate each other over vast distances. Addax can also track rainfall and will head for rainy areas where vegetation is more abundant. Some addax live in herds which contain 5 \u2013 20 individuals of both male and female addax. The herds generally stay in one place, but may wander in search of food. Herds are usually led by the eldest dominant male.\u00a0",
            "reproduction": "Male addax reach sexual maturity at 3 years old whereby females mature much earlier at one and a half years. After a gestation period of 257 \u2013 264 days (8 \u2013 9 months), females give birth to one young which weighs 4.7 \u2013 6.75 kilograms. The young addax is hidden away for around 6 weeks and suckled 2 \u2013 3 times a day by its mother. Young addax have a tan colored coat with very faint or no markings. The life span of the addax is around 19 years.\u00a0",
            "conservation status": "The Addax is classed as \u2018Critically Endangered\u2019 by the IUCN. Addax are nearly extinct in the wild, having been eliminated from much of their original range. Farmers have destroyed many so that cattle do not have to compete for grazing land. There are only a few hundred left in the wild. Excessive hunting for its horns, flesh and hide seems to be the main cause of decline for the addax. The good news is that there are over 1,000 addax held in captivity in the US, Europe and the Middle East. There are reportedly 600 addax managed in captive breeding programs, therefore, with continued conservation efforts, the future for this amazing animal may be a success."

        "Adelie Penguin": {
            "image": "https://animalcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/adelie-penguin-1-340x200.jpg",
            "desc": "The Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) is, together with the Emperor Penguin, one of the only two types of penguin living on the Antarctic mainland. This species is common along the entire Antarctic coast and nearby islands. Adelie penguins are the smallest of the penguins living on the Antarctica continent. Adelie penguins were named after the wife of a French explorer in the 1830s. Adelie penguins nest and breed on the rocky, ice-free beaches in large colonies of ten thousands of birds. There are over 2.5 million breeding pairs living in the Antarctica region. ",
            "characteristics": "Adelie penguins are 60 to 70 centimetres long and around 4 kilograms in weight.Distinctive marks are the white ring surrounding the eye and the feathers at the base of the bill.These long feathers hide most of their red bill. Their tails are a little bit longer than other penguins tails.",
            "diet": "Adelie penguins are highly dependant on crustaceans, such as krill. Fish and amphipods can also be common foods in certain locations during certain seasons.",
            "reproduction": "Adelie penguins arrive at their breeding grounds in October. Their nests consist of stones piled together. The male Adelie penguins summon the females with a low guttural noise followed by a loud cry. A female Adelie penguin typically lays two eggs which are brown or green in color.In December, the warmest month in Antarctica (about -2\u00b0C), the parents alternate periods of incubating the egg. One parent goes to feed and the other stays to warm the egg. The parent who is incubating does not eat. In March, the adults and their young return to the sea. Adelie penguins have to defend their nests from other penguins who try to steal pebbles, stones, and other nest building materials. Adelie penguins do not drink water but instead, they eat snow. They have a gland in their nose that takes the salt out of the ocean water that they swallow when catching fish and eating fish while in the water.",
            "migration": "Adelie Penguins are migratory penguins and after breeding, they do not return to their colonies until the next spring. Little is know about the non-breeding distribution of this species. There are only a few records of Adelie Penguins during the Antarctic winter.Recent work using satellite telemetry indicates that Adelie Penguins from the Ross Sea leave this area in autumn and migrate about 600 kilometres north of the Antarctic continent. Juveniles are suspected to travel even further north than adults.",

            "desc": "The African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is a sub-Saharan African bovine, of which there are five species. These animals are large and widely regarded as one of the most dangerous animals on the African continent. It has a very unpredictable temperament and has never been domesticated; in fact, it is not an ancestor of domestic cattle and is only distantly related to other larger bovines. These animals belong to the genus Syncerus and the family Bovidae. They are found mostly in savannas, swamps and floodplains. They are grazing ruminants, eating grass and sedges as well as cud or bolus. The African buffalo has very few predators and are capable of defending themselves against large animals such as African lions. Despite this, lions do regularly eat buffalos. The nominate subspecies, the Cape buffalo, is a member of the big five and is therefore sought after for trophy hunting. Hunting, along with loss of habitat, is one of the main reasons the population of the African buffalo is declining. It is currently listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN Red List.",
            "syncerus caffer caffer (cape buffalo)": "The Cape buffalo is found in South Africa and East Africa. They are the nominate species and the largest species, with adult males weighing up to 870 kg (1,920 lb). They are also the darkest in color, almost black.",
            "syncerus caffer nanus (forest buffalo, dwarf buffalo or congo buffalo)": "The forest buffalo is found in forest areas of Central and West Africa. It is the smallest of the subspecies, weighing around 270 kg (600 lb), with a height of 120 cm at the withers. This makes this subspecies around the same size as a zebra and around two to three times lighter than the nominate species.These buffalo are red in color, with darker patches on the head and shoulders, and in the ears, forming a brush. They appear so different to the nominate species that some believe they are two separate species.",
            "syncerus caffer brachyceros (sudan buffalo)": "The Sudan buffalo is found in West Africa and is an intermediate between the first two subspecies. They are quite small, with adult buffalo averaging a weight up to 400 kg (880 lb).",
            "syncerus caffer aequinoctialis (nile buffalo)": "The Nile buffalo is found in Central Africa and is similar to the Cape buffalo. However, it is smaller than the Cape buffalo and is lighter in color. Sometimes, this subspecies is thought to be the same as the Sudan buffalo.",
            "syncerus caffer mathewsi (mountain buffalo or virunga buffalo)": "The mountain buffalo is found in the mountainous areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Uganda. It is not universally recognized by all authorities.African Buffalo CharacteristicsThe African buffalo is a very large species that can weigh between 425 to 870 kg (937 to 1,918 lb), depending on the subspecies, with males normally larger than females. Their shoulder height can range from 1.0 to 1.7 m (3.3 to 5.6 ft) and its head and body length can range from 1.7 to 3.4 m (5.6 to 11.2 ft). The tail can range from 70 to 110 cm (28 to 43 in) long.These animals have a long but stocky body, and short, thick legs. They usually have black or dark brown coats, and older bulls will have whitish circles around their eyes and on their face. Females tend to have more-reddish coats. The front of their body is more powerful than the back, with their hooves wider at the front to help support their weight.The African buffalo is best known for its horns. The horns have fused bases, forming a continuous bone shield across the top of the head referred to as a \u201cboss\u201d. The horns curve upwards and outwards, and, in some large animals, the distance between the ends of the horns can reach upwards of one meter. These horns reach their full size when they are five or six year old, but do not become hard until they are eight or nine years old.",
            "lifespan": "African buffalos can live for up to 22 years in the wild and up to 29 years in captivity. Males are more likely to have a shorter lifespan than females or sub-adults, and they are preyed on by lions at a higher average rate than females.",
            "diet": "Grass makes up the majority of the African buffalo diet \u2014 and they eat a lot of it. They also eat cud or bolus to ensure they are getting all the nutrients from their food. These buffalo generally prefer grasses with a higher leaf to stem ratio.They use their tongue and wide incisor row to eat grass more quickly than most other African herbivores. Once they have depleted an area of grass, they won\u2019t stay and will move on quickly.",
            "behavior": "African buffalo are a social animal, although their herd size can vary greatly. Herds are usually made up of family members, including related females and their offspring. These herds are surrounded by subherds of subordinate males, high-ranking males and females, and old or invalid animals.Males have a linear dominance hierarchy based on age and size. Young males keep their distance from the dominant bull, although dominant bulls may tolerate subordinate bulls in the same herd. This is because the larger the herd is, the safer the buffalos are.Males split from the herd and form bachelor groups in the dry season. There are two types of bachelor herds occur: ones made of males aged four to seven years and those of males 12 years or older. During the wet season, the younger bulls rejoin a herd to mate with the females and then stay with them throughout the season to protect the calves.Herd MovementWhen it comes to herd movement, the females exhibit a sort of \u201cvoting behavior\u201d in which they sit in the direction they think they should move. Many of the behaviors of the African buffalo can vary on certain factors such as time of the year and predation threats. For example, they tend to feed for an average of 1.5 hours in July, but in April, this can be up to 4.5 hours.African buffalo attempt to locate a potential threat, usually visually, by scrutinizing their environment. To do this, they remain stationary and adjust the position of their head depending on distance and angle of the potential threat. When herds are chased by predators, they stick together and ensure calves are gathered in the middle of the group.These animals have very good eyesight and can spot threats from over 1 kilometer away. As well as silent and visual cues, buffalos also use vocalizations to communicate with each other. Male bulls will engage in play, dominance interactions, or actual fights, although these are rare.African buffalo are very dangerous to humans. They are most dangerous and most likely to attack when hurt, which is why hunters are often attacked and killed by these animals. In fact, they are in the top five of the most dangerous animals to hunt. Because they are so strong, have such large horns and are so fast, you won\u2019t have much luck trying to get away unscathed from one if it is chasing you. Buffalos kill an estimated 200 people each year.",
            "reproduction": "Mating takes place throughout the year as female buffalo are polyestrus, with a cycle lasting 21 to 22 days. However, there is a spike in mating towards the end of the wet season, which can be called there buffalos mating season.As the mating season nears, males from bachelor groups will rejoin a herd to find a mate. Once he has found one, he will follow the female around until she is receptive to mating. Sometimes, the female is approached by a more dominant male, which results in the original male returning to grazing. Once copulation has taken place, other males may copulate with the same female. These animals are not monogamous, nor does a bond last between them.The gestation period for the African buffalos is around 11.5 months. Newborns usually weigh between 24 and 60 kg. Females remain with their newborns as they gain strength after birth while the rest of the herd moves on to forage. Females feed, defend, guide, stroke and play with their calves, while males have nothing to do with tasing the young. Occasionally, orphaned calves will be taken in by older females, who may adopt multiple orphan calves at one time.Calves are typically weaned by 9 or 10 months, and begin eating solid foods by their second month. They become independent between one and two years of age. Female African buffalos usually give birth to their first calf at five years of age. They usually breed again after 18 to 19 months. Males are sexually mature by 4 to 6 years.",
            "location and habitat": "African buffalos are found throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Their exact location depends on their subspecies: the Cape buffalo is found in Southern and East Africa, the forest buffalo is found in forest areas of Central and West Africa, the Sudan buffalo is found in West Africa and the Nile buffalo is found in Central Africa. Some of these buffalos have overlapping range, and it is for this reason that it is not uncommon to see hybrids of two subspecies.These animals are reside in dense lowland forests, lowland rainforests, montane forests and grasslands, Acacia grasslands, miombo woodlands, coastal savannas, plains and semi-arid bushland. In fact, they can and will reside anywhere with permanent water and grass.They like to live less than 1 km to a water source and can be found at altitudes exceeding 4000 m. Often, the areas in which they live depends on the amount of rainfall that area receives. They also prefer a habitat with dense cover, such as reeds and thickets, but can also be found in open woodland.African Buffalo Conservation StatusAll of the subspecies of African buffalo are considered together by the IUCN and are listed as Near Threatened. In the 1800\u2019s African buffalo populations were exposed to rinderpest, a disease of domestic cattle, which caused a significant decline in the species. Fortunately, the species have since recovered, but they are still at risk from other factors. The current population of African buffalo is around 400,000 individuals.The main threats to African buffalo are habitat loss and poaching. As one of the big five, these animals are often targeted by poachers and trophy hunters. Some hunters pay over $10,000 for the opportunity to hunt one. Habitat loss is caused by climate change, which can subsequently change the ecosystem in the area.",
            "predators": "Aside from humans, African buffalo have very few natural predators. Their biggest predators are African lions, although they can and will defend themselves from lions. They may also be eaten by large crocodiles.It can take more than one lion, and sometimes an entire pride, to bring down a buffalo. African buffalo can outrun lions by about 10 km per hour so, to be successful, lions must ambush them from a close distance.Other animals, such as cheetahs, leopards, and spotted hyenas, along with lions and crocodiles, are a threat to newborn and young buffalo. African wild dogs can also be a threat to young and, on occasion, full grown cows too.",
            "ecological importance": "African buffalos are important to their ecosystem largely due to the way in which they graze. They are cyclical grazers, meaning they return to the same areas to graze again once the vegetation has grown enough. This is important for animals that move either with the buffalo herd or follow after the herd, such as zebras and wildebeest, as it opens up new patches of vegetation for them to feed.African Buffalo FAQsWhat is the scientific name for African Buffalo?The scientific name for an African Buffalo is Syncerus caffer.Where do African buffalos live?African buffalos are native to sub-Saharan Africa. Their exact location depends on their subspecies.What do African buffalos eat?African buffalos are herbivores and eat mainly grass. They prefer plants with a higher leaf to stem ratio. These animals spent a lot of their time grazing, and move on quickly to new areas once they have depleted the area.How many subspecies of African buffalo are there?There are four confirmed subspecies of African buffalo \u2014 Cape Buffalo, Forest Buffalo, Sudan Buffalo and Nile Buffalo \u2014 and one that is not recognized by all authorities, the Mountain Buffalo.How big are African buffalo?African buffalo are very large. Depending on the subspecies, they can weigh up to 870 kg (1,918 lb), with a shoulder height up to 1.7 m (5.6 ft).Can African buffalo hurt humans?African buffalo are one of the most dangerous of all African wildlife and can and will hurt humans. Buffalo attacks are common in nature, with an estimated 200 people dying per year by attack from African buffalo.They are said to have killed more big game hunters than any other animals in the African wildlife, and rank in the top five of the most dangerous animals to hunt. This is because they are most aggressive when they are wounded, or if a calf from the herd has been attacked by predators.What are the other members of the Big Five?African buffalos are a member of the big five, which makes them a popular sight by tourists on safaris, and also popular by trophy hunters.How fast can African buffalo run?These animals are very fast. They can outrun a lion, and are known to be able to run at speeds of up to 35 mph (56.3 kph) to escape predators.What\u2019s the difference between Buffalo vs Bison?Bison are usually larger than buffalo, and they have longer hair.Learn about other animals from Africa"

In contrast to the Asian elephants protruding forehead, the African elephants forehead is flat without any bumps and slopes down smoothly towards its trunk. Their underlip is short, broad and rounded and both female and male African elephants have tusks which are thick and curved forward. African elephants are also larger in size as compared to male and female Asian elephants.The largest African elephants recorded weight was over 9 tons and it stood more than 12 feet high at the shoulder. The African elephants average weight is up to 7 tons, about the equivalent of 78 adult human males weighing an average of 90 kilograms each.African elephants have 4 nails on their fore feet and their hind feet have 3 nails, just like the Asian elephant, however, African elephants have 2 prehensile fingers at the tip of their trunks whereas the Asian elephant only has one.African elephants are named for the peculiar shaped ridges of their molar teeth. The ridges of an African elephants teeth are coarser and fewer than those of the Asian elephant.Here are some facts about the anatomy of an African Elephant:Heart and liver: The elephant heart weights 22 kilograms and circulates about 450 litres of blood. Inner \u2018cleaning\u2019 is performed by a 77 kilograms liver.Water and trunk: To drink its 9 litres of water at a time, the elephant uses its trunk which weighs 113 kilograms.Tongue: Helping the swallowing process is a 12 kilogram elephant tongue.Food and intestines: The approximately 250 kilograms food eaten every day passes through 18 metres of intestines. Eventually processed into about 100 kilograms of elephant dung per day. African elephants are herbivorous. Their diet varies according to their habitat. Elephants living in forests, partial deserts and grasslands all eat different proportions of herbs and tree or shrubbery leaves. Elephants inhabiting the shores of Lake Kariba have been recorded eating underwater plant life.Digestion: Elephants only digest about 40% of what they eat and therefore, they need to spend two-thirds of every day eating.Gas: An elephant \u2018releases\u2019 2000 litres of methane gas per day.Skin: An elephants skin weighs 450 \u2013 750 kilograms.Tail: An elephants tail weighs 11 kilograms.Fighting: The longest recorded fight between two elephants was recorded at 10 hours and 56 minutes.Matriarch: Elephant herds consist of females and the young. A herd is led by a matriarch (grandmother). As young males reached maturity they are chased away by the herd. Bull elephants join the herd only for mating.Gestation: An elephants gestation (conception to birth) is 23 months. Gestation period tends to be slightly longer than in the Asian elephant.Sound:  Most of the communication between elephants occurs at an infra sound level.Call: It is estimated that an area of 50 square kilometres is filled with particular elephant \u2018call\u2019 in infra sound. This might increase to about 300 square kilometres at dusk due to lower temperatures.Eyes: An elephants eyes are very small in relation to its head. The eye contains very few photoreceptors and they cannot see very well further than a few hundred feet.Speed: An elephant can walk rather fast and charge even faster.No jumping: Elephants cannot jump.Swimming: Elephants love water and are excellent swimmers.Trunk: An elephants trunk is the most versatile of all mammalian creations being used as a nose, arm, hand and multipurpose tool. It is powerful enough to kill a lion with a single swipe, yet the finger-like lobes at the end are adept enough to pluck a feather from the ground.Trunk muscles: The trunk is boneless and is composed of an estimated 40 000 muscles.Tusks: Elephants tusks are elongated upper incisor teeth, which grow continuously throughout the elephants life. They are not always an exact match, as this depends on which side they favour much like left and right-handed humans.Ears: An elephants ears are covered in veins, which form distinct and unique patterns which can be used to identify individuals \u2013 much like human fingerprints. An elephants ears are packed with blood vessels and when flapped, they quickly lower the animals body temperature. This swiftly circulating blood is cooled by about 9 degrees Fahrenheit while in the elephants ear.The African Bush Elephant is an intelligent animal. Experiments with reasoning and learning show that they are the smartest ungulates together with their Asian cousins. This is mostly due to their large brain.In most places, the adult African Bush Elephant lacks natural predators thanks to its great size, however, the calves (especially the newborn) are vulnerable to lions and crocodile attacks and (rarely) to leopard and hyena attacks.\u00a0",
            "african bush elephant conservation status": "While the African elephant is classed as vulnerable, conditions vary somewhat by region within eastern and southern Africa.In 2006, an elephant slaughter was documented in southeastern Chad by aerial surveys. A series of poaching incidents, resulting in the killing of over 100 elephants, was carried out during the late spring and summer of 2006 in the vicinity of Zakouma National Park. This region has a decades-old history of poaching of elephants, as one of Africa\u2019s big five game, which has caused the elephant population of the region, which exceeded 300,000 in 1970, to drop to approximately 10,000 today. The African elephant officially is protected by Chadian government, but the resources and manpower provided by the government (with some European Union assistance) have proven insufficient to stop the poaching.\u00a0Human encroachment into or adjacent to natural areas where bush elephants occur has led to recent research into methods of safely driving groups of elephants away from humans, including the discovery that playback of the recorded sounds of angry honey bees are remarkably effective at prompting elephants to flee an area."

            "characteristics": "African penguins stand about 27 inches (60 centimetres tall) and weigh from 7 to 11 pounds. (2.5 to 4 kilograms). African penguins live and breed on the coast of South Africa and on the off shore islands. During the 17th and 18th century the African penguin was killed for food and oil. \u00a0",
            "range": "The African Penguin is the only penguin species that breeds in Africa and it is found nowhere else. Its distribution coincides roughly with the cold, nutrient rich, Benguela Current. The distribution of African Penguins is further determined by the availability of offshore islands as breeding sites.x",
            "diet": "African Penguins feed primarily on shoaling pelagic fish such as anchovies, pilchards (sardines), horse mackerel and round herrings, supplemented by squid and crustaceans. When on the hunt for prey, African Penguins can reach a top speed of up to 20 kilometres per hour.The distance that African penguins have to travel to find food varies, both temporally and spatially. On the west coast a typical foraging trip could range from 30 to 70 kilometres. for a single trip. On the south coast, foraging birds cover an average of 110 kilometres per trip. When penguins are feeding their young, the distance they can travel from the breeding colony is more limited. An average dive of an African Penguin lasts about two and a half minutes and is regularly about 30 metres in depth, although dive depths of up to 130 metres have been recorded.\u00a0",
            "nesting": "The nests are built far apart from other nests. They can be built under bushes or on sandy beaches. Two eggs are usually laid and in years when there is plenty of food both chicks will survive. Incubation takes 38 to 41 days for the the eggs to hatch. This task is shared equally by both parents taking a 1 to 3 day shift. The chicks are kept warm and protected for about 40 days after hatching by both parents. The chicks get their adult feathers when they are 70 to 100 days old. At this time they go to sea and are on their own.\u00a0",
            "reproduction": "African Penguins start breeding from between 2 to 6 years of age, but normally at 4 years. As with most other penguins, the African Penguin breeds colonially, mostly on rocky offshore islands, either nesting in burrows they excavate themselves, or in depressions under boulders or bushes. Shelter at the nest site is important to provide shade (and protection against the temperate climate) and for protection against predators of eggs and chicks, such as Kelp Gulls and Sacred Ibises.Unlike many other bird species, African Penguins have an extended breeding season. In most colonies, birds at some stage of breeding will be present throughout the year. Broad regional differences do exist, though, and the peak of the breeding season in Namibia (November and December) tends to be earlier than the peak for South Africa (March to May).African Penguins are monogamous and the same pair will generally return to the same colony and often the same nest site each year. About 80 to 90% of pairs remain together in consecutive breeding seasons, and some are known to have remained together for over 10 years. The average clutch size for African Penguins is 2, and the incubation period about 40 days, with the male and female participating equally in the incubation duties. The length of the incubation shift is dependant on the availability of food at the time, but is typically about two and a half days.Both parents continue to brood the chicks and for about the first 15 days the chicks are constantly brooded by one of the adults. After this, the chicks attain full control over their body temperature. However, at this stage the chicks are still at risk from predators, and the adults continue to guard the chicks until they are about 30 days old, after which both parents can go to sea simultaneously. Chicks that are left alone often form creches, which serve more to reduce attacks on chicks from adults than to avoid predation.African Penguin chicks can fledge anytime from 60 to 130 days of age. The fledging period and the fledging weight of chicks, as well as the number of chicks in the brood that are successfully fledged, are dependent on the availability and quality of food. The adults continue to feed chicks while the young are still present at the colony. When the young eventually leave the colony, they do so without their parents. These juveniles remain away from their natal colonies for anything from 12 to 22 months, after which time they return, normally to their natal colony, to molt into adult plumage.\u00a0",
            "adaptions": "Penguins are adapted primarily to cool aquatic environments, and the need to reduce heat loss is of major importance to all penguins. However some species, including the African Penguin, have been able to successfully exploit warm terrestrial environments. Behavioural and physiological adaptations have enabled the African Penguin to overcome the problem of being over-insulated for life on land in a temperate climate.One of the ways in which African Penguins have adapted to terrestrial life in the temperate zone is to confine their activities at breeding sites largely to dawn and dusk periods. Breeding birds nest mostly in burrows or under some other form of shelter, such as boulders and bushes, which provide some protection from the intense heat during the day. Birds that are not incubating or brooding chicks, and other non-breeding birds, spend the day at sea or loaf in beach groups and swim regularly. Some birds do remain in the open (i.e. outside of burrows and other sheltered nests) in the colony; but these birds generally position themselves with their backs to the sun so that their feet, flippers and oral surfaces are shaded.\u00a0",
            "conservation": "Given an annual rate of decline of about 2% per year, there is considerable concern about the long-term viability of African Penguins in the wild. By the late 1990s the population had recovered slightly, and in 1999 there was an estimated 224,000 individuals. The African Penguin is classified as Vulnerable in the South African Red Data Book for birds, is considered Vulnerable in terms of the IUCN threatened species categories, and is listed in Appendix II of CITES and the Bonn Convention for the conservation of migratory species.The reasons for the significant decline in the African Penguin populations are well known. Initially, the decline was due mostly to the exploitation of penguin eggs for food and habitat alteration and disturbance associated with guano collection at breeding colonies. These factors have now largely ceased and the major current threats include competition with commercial fisheries for pelagic fish prey and oil pollution. Other threats include competition with Cape Fur Seals for space at breeding colonies and for food resources, as well as predation by seals on penguins. Feral cats are present and pose a problem at a few of the colonies. African Penguins also face predation of eggs and chicks by avian predators such as Kelp Gulls and Sacred Ibises, while natural terrestrial predators, such as mongoose, genets and leopard are present at the mainland colonies.The African penguin is a protected species, but their habitats continue to be damaged by oil spills from tankers off the Southern coast of Africa. Recently a successful effort has been made to establish new breeding colonies of the African penguins in the area. There are also rescue services to aid penguins that have been harmed by the oil slicks."

It is a desert-dwelling tortoise whose range extends along the southern edge of the Sahara Desert from Senegal and Mauritania, east through Mali, Chad, the Sudan and Ethiopia to Eritrea. The African Spurred Tortoise is the third largest tortoise in the world and the\u00a0largest of all mainland species of tortoise. It is native to the southern edge of the Sahara Desert and the Sahel, but is becoming more common as a pet throughout the United States. Unfortunately, although they make good pets and are gaining popularity, the numbers of these desert tortoises in the wild are falling. The African Spurred tortoise\u2019s scientific name is Centrochelys sulcata or Geochelone sulcata. The name \u201cSulcata\u201d is from the Latin sulcatus, which means furrowed and refers to the patterns on the animal\u2019s shell. The tortoise is also known as the Spur Thigh Tortoise. The Sulcata tortoise is the only species in its genus.",

            "diet": "The Sulcata is a herbivore and eats grasses, weeds and succulents. The tortoise\u2019s diet is low in protein and high in fiber. Sulcatas will search for food during the cooler parts of the day. They have a slow metabolism and can go weeks without eating or drinking. However, when they do come across a source of water, they can drink as much as 15% of their body weight in one go!",
            "behavior": "Both male and female Sulcatas can be very aggressive and ramming often occurs. Males are more likely to ram other males. They can also try to flip each other over, although, unless there is a big size difference between the two Sulcatas, they will most likely not be successful. If a Sulcata is flipped over, they can quickly die of hyperthermia. This is because it is very difficult for a flipped-over tortoise to right itself.Sulcatas are crepuscular. This means they are out at dawn or dusk and spend time basking in the morning sun to regulate their body heat.",
            "reproduction": "Adult Sulcatas can reproduce throughout the year but usually mate between September and late November, just after the rainy season. Males will fight with each other for breeding rights with females, often ramming each other and flipping each other over.Around 60 days after mating, a female Sulcata will begin to look for the right nesting site. This could take up to two weeks. Once she has settled on a place, she will dig a hole in loose soil around 2 feet across and 3 to 6 inches deep. She does this with her front feet, and then uses her back feet to dig another hole at the back of the first hole. This whole process can take up to five hours depending on how soft the soil is!Once the nest is ready, the female will lay eggs at a rate of one about every 3 minutes until she laid between 15 and 30 eggs. She then spends about an hour filling in her nest, covering all the eggs.Tortoises and other reptiles don\u2019t exactly \u201craise young\u201d and, once the eggs have been laid, parental involvement stops there. The eggs hatch after about 8 months. The baby tortoises are usually around 2 to 3 inches long at birth, but grow quickly and can be 6 to 10 inches long after a few years. They are golden or tan in color, and their carapaces are oval and serrated. The sex of a hatchling is most likely determined by the temperature it was exposed to in the egg and not by chromosomes.Baby sulcatas are normally aggressive from the start and very active. It is not uncommon for hatchlings to ram each other and try to flip each other over.Sulcatas do not reach sexual maturity until they are 15 years old, which is one of the reasons why their numbers are declining.Sulcata Tortoise \u2013 Location and HabitatThese tortoises live in countries that are at least partly located in the Sahara desert, such as Ethiopia, Mali, Sudan, Mauritania. This means they are located in places that are very hot and dry, and are adapted to survive.Sulcatas dig burrows in the ground which allow them to escape from the very hot climate that they live in. These burrows are usually 30 inches in depth, but some Sulcatas will dig tunnel systems 10 feet or more in length! They will flip mud onto their backs if they are too hot, or, if there is no mud because the temperature is too hot, they will cover their legs with their own saliva to cool down.A burrow not only protects a Sulcata from the arid environment, but also provides them with enough moisture. Sulcatas are designed to retain moisture so they do not dehydrate in their hot climate. They regulate their urine output and their skin is highly permeable when they are exposed to moisture. It is thought that they get all the moisture they need from their food, and so not need to seek out other water sources. This is confirmed by Sulcatas living in zoos \u2014 it has been noted by zookeepers that a Sulcata seems to show very little interest in water even when it is on offer, so they must get the moisture they need from their plants.While Sulcatas can tolerate some surprisingly low body temperatures, they will actively seek refuge when it gets cold outside. This is interesting, because most tropical tortoises would not do this and freeze when it got cold.\u00a0Sulcata Tortoise Conservation StatusSulcatas are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This is most likely due to habitat loss and the increase in popularity of the Sulcata as a pet. Desertification is also a problem when it comes to Sulcata populations because, although they live in an arid area, an area that is too dry will not contain enough food for them to eat.",
            "predators": "There are very few natural predators of Sulcata tortoises. This is because they are able to withdraw into their shells to escape from anything that might eat them. In fact, Sulcatas are more at risk from their habitat and humans than other animals. Humans hunt and eat the Sulcata tortoise, too.",
            "sulcata tortoise fun fact": "Some cultures in Africa believe the Sulcata tortoise is an intermediary between the people and their ancestors and gods.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

Larger packs may hunt larger animals such as wildebeests.Warthogs are also hunted, however, care has to be taken not be inflicted with a potentially lethal wound by the warthogs sharp tusks although safety in numbers is usually the resolve. Wild dogs rarely consume carrion and will not return to an earlier kill.",
            "behaviour and hunting": "African Wild Dogs live together in packs containing between 10 \u2013 20 individuals. Home ranges vary in size and depend on the availability of prey but can be more than 1000 square kilometres (620 square miles). Packs often contain more males than females. Most members of the pack are related to each other in some way. Packs will contain an alpha male and female who are the main breeding pairs.Males and females each have their own hierarchies with the oldest female being the dominant individual and in contrast, the youngest male taking charge of the males. Wild dogs are very sociable animals and have a submissive based hierarchy rather than a dominant one. Dominance is established without any fighting or blood-shed. Even over food, an individual will energetically beg rather than get into conflict. This non-aggressive approach is emphasised perhaps because if any injuries occur, the pack will be short of hunters and unable to provide as much for its members.African Wild Dog packs have intense social bonds and these bonds are a great advantage during hunts. They are extremely co-operative as a hunting pack when running down and over-powering prey in long distance chases. Hunts are not strategically cunning at all. In the early, cool mornings and late afternoons the Wild Dogs will approach their prey in full view. Surprise attacks are unnecessary as African Wild Dogs have the stamina to chase prey until it is exhausted.The Wild Dogs top speed is 60 kilometres per hour (37 miles per hour) and prey will most often be able to gallop so what faster. However, prey will eventually be chased down over distances of 6 kilometres (3.5 miles). Typical hunts are seen more as an endurance chase. During these long distance chases, Wild Dogs will spread out to prevent prey from any sideways escape attempts. The preys zig-zagging evasive movements which would normally confuse a lone hunter such as a Cheetah, are ineffective against the pack of wild dogs.The hunting pack keep in touch constantly throughout the hunt by producing high pitched yapping contact calls. As the exhausted prey eventually slows down, the dogs surround it targeting their softer underparts and killing their victim. Wild Dog hunts have a high success rate with 3 out of 4 hunts resulting in a kill. While a whole herd of ungulates may be targeted, the eventual victim will be the one who falls behind due to age or sickness.African Wild Dogs have a very powerful bite and their large molars and premolars allow them to easily crush the bones of their catch. When the dogs have eaten their prey, they return to the pack and regurgitate the food to pups, older dogs and to members that where not part of the hunt.",
            "reproduction": "There is no particular breeding season for the African Wild Dog although mating can increase through the latter part of the rainy season around March and June. After a gestation period of around 70 days, the female gives birth to a litter of around 10 pups (few usually survive because of predators).Pups are born in an underground den or another animals abandoned den (usually an Aardvark). Pups are weaned at 10 weeks and when they reach 3 months, they leave the den to begin running with the pack. They are able to kill small prey at 11 months and can fend for themselves at around 14 months. Pups are able to breed when they reach sexual maturity at between 12 \u2013 18 months.Male wild dogs continue to stay with their birth pack, however, females may leave and join other packs that lack sexually mature females. This behaviour is quite unusual as it is the opposite way round with most other social animals. Other unusual traits of the wild dogs is that the females will compete for access to the males and males are often left to rear the pups while the female joins the hunting pack.The average lifespan of a wild dog is 10 years.",
            "conservation status": "African Wild Dogs are an endangered species. Once there were around 500,000, now there are only 2,000 \u2013 5,000 in existence today mostly living in national parks or preserves.Major threats to wild dogs are hunting and habitat loss. Competition with larger carnivores such as lions and spotted hyenas is also a problem for the wild dog as they both pursue the same type of prey. Lions will kill as many wild dogs as it can, but it does not eat them. Wild dogs are also killed by farmers who want to protect their livestock and disease can spread from domestic animals. These problems have all contributed to the small size of wild dog populations."

            "desc": "Africanized Bees are also known as Africanized Honey Bees as they are a honey producing bee. Africanized Bees are also known as \u2018Killer Bees\u2018 and are hybrids of the African Honey Bee and various European Honey Bees. The Africanized Bee in the western hemisphere descended from 26 Tanzanian queen bees (A. m. scutellata) accidentally released by a replacement bee keeper in 1957. The release happened near Rio Claro, S\u00e3o Paulo State in the south of Brazil from hives operated by biologist Warwick E. Kerr, who had interbred honey bees from Europe and southern Africa. Hives containing these particular bees were observed as being different and were noted to be particularly more defensive than other honey bees. The hives from which the bees were released had special excluder grates which were in place to prevent the larger queen bees from getting out but to allow the drones free access to mate with the queen.",
            "": "Not all Africanized hives are defensive. Some are quite gentle, which gives a beginning point for beekeepers to breed a gentler stock. This has been done in Brazil, where bee incidents are much less common than they were during the first wave of the Africanized bees\u2019 colonization. Now that the Africanized bee has been \u2018re-domesticated\u2019, it is considered the bee of choice for beekeeping in Brazil. It is better adapted to the tropics and so is healthier and more industrious than European bees.",
            "africanized bee venom": "The venom of an Africanized bee is no more potent than that of a normal honey bee, but since the former subspecies tends to sting in greater numbers, the number of deaths from them are greater than any other subspecies. However, allergic reaction to bee venom from any bee can kill a person and it is difficult to estimate how many more people have died due to the presence of Africanized bees."

Allen\u2019s Swamp Monkey can be found in the Congo basin, in the Republic of Congo and in the west of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Allen\u2019s Swamp Monkey is a rather strongly built monkey with grey/green skin. The Allen\u2019s Swamp Monkeys face is reddish with long hair bundles at the cheeks. The slight webbing of the fingers and toes point to its partially aquatic way of life. Allen\u2019s Swamp Monkey can reach a full body length from 45 to 60 centimetres with a 50 centimetres long tail. Males, weighing up to 6 kilograms, are quite larger than the females which weigh up to 3.5 kilograms.",
            "genus: miopithecus \u2013 angolan talapoin/gabon talapoin": "Talapoin monkeys are the two species of Old World monkeys classified in genus Miopithecus. Talapoin Monkeys live in central Africa and their range extends from Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Angola.It has been customary to recognize only a single species in the genus Miopithecus talapoin the Angolan Talapoin, however, the population in Cameroon (south of the River Sanaga), Rio Muni and Gabon can be distinguished as a separate species, Miopithecus ogouensis the Gabon Talapoin.Talapoin Monkeys are the smallest Old World monkeys and almost certainly evolved from a larger-bodied ancestor by dwarfing. Their fur is coarsely banded yellow-and-black dorsally and white or greyish white ventrally.Their head is round and short-snouted with a hairless face. Their nose is black and the skin bordering the face is also black. In males, the scrotum is colored pink medially and blue laterally.There is mild sexual dimorphism in body size. Average head and body length is 16 inches (40 centimetres) and average tail length is 21 inches (52.5 centimetres). Talapoins weigh 3lb 1oz (1380 grams) for males and 21b 10oz (1120 grams) for females.Talapoin Monkeys are both diurnal and predominantly arboreal, although they may occasionally descend to the ground while foraging. Talapoin Monkeys are good swimmers and commonly sleep on branches overhanging rivers so that they can dive to escape from predators.Talapoin Monkeys live in large groups of 60 to 100 animals. They congregate at night in trees close to the water, dividing into smaller sub-groups during the day in order to spread out to find food. Groups are composed of several fully mature males, numerous females and their offspring. Unlike the closely related Guenons, Talapoin Monkeys do not have any territorial behaviours.Talapoin Monkeys like to play and this mostly takes place between juveniles, however, adults also engage in play. Talapoin Monkeys have two types of play \u2013 wrestling which includes grabbing and grappling and sometimes includes playface and running which includes fast chasing of one individual by another. Male Talapoins tend to engage in social play more often than female Talapoins.Talapoin Monkeys verbal repertoire is rather smaller although when an individual attacks, it will look at it and give \u2018pant chirps\u2019 to other individuals that it is not attacking and they respond by joining in on the attack.As in all primates, communication in this species is likely to be complex. Both vocalizations and visual signals (such as body posture and facial expressions) are used by primates to communicate with con-specifics. In addition, tactile communication may play some role in maintaining social bonds, as in the form of grooming. Some primates use chemical communication, especially in reproductive contexts.Talapoin Monkeys are omnivores, their diet consisting mainly of fruits, seeds, aquatic plants, insects, shellfish, bird eggs and small vertebrates.The highest recorded age of a Talapoin Monkey in captivity is 28 years, while the life expectancy in the wild is not well-known, however, is likely to be lower than that seen in captivity. A female Talapoin Monkeys 160 day gestation period (typically from November to March) results in the birth of a single young.Offspring are considerably large and well developed (newborns weigh over 200 grams and are about a quarter of the weight of the mother) and develop rapidly. Within 6 weeks they eat solid food and are independent at 3 months of age.Predators of Talapoin Monkey include leopards, golden cats, genets, raptors, large snakes, and Nile monitors. Talapoin Monkeys may help to disperse seeds of the fruits they eat and control insect populations.They also act as important prey animals for medium to large predators. Talapoin Monkeys are not currently regarded as threatened. They are occasionally hunted as a source of bush meat, although their small body size makes this relatively unprofitable.\u00a0",
            "genus: erythrocebus \u2013 patas monkey": "The Patas Monkey (Erythrocebus patas) is a ground-dwelling monkey distributed over West Africa.The Patas Monkey are found in the following countries:Benin Burkina Faso Cameroon Central African Republic Chad DR Congo Cote d\u2019Ivoire Ethiopia Gambia Ghana Guinea Guinea-Bissau Kenya Mali Mauritania Niger Nigeria Senegal Sierra Leone Sudan Tanzania Togo UgandaIt is the only species classified in the genus Erythrocebus. There are two subspecies of Patas Monkey, the western Erythrocebus patas patas (Common Patas) and the eastern Erythrocebus patas pyrrhonotus (Nisnas).The Nisnas has a white nose and the Common Patas monkey has a black nose. Patas Monkeys are the worlds fastest terrestrial primates. A male patas monkey is capable of running at least 35 miles per hour. In the wild, Patas Monkeys spend more time on the ground than any other monkey.The body plan of a patas monkey bears a remarkable resemblance to that of a greyhound dog. It has the same long legs, narrow body and prominent rib cage. Its long legs give it a tremendous loping stride when running. Because of their speed, coloring and gait, Patas monkeys have often been mistaken for cheetahs while running.Patas monkeys are reddish tan in color with very expressive, whiskered faces. The whiskers sit on a grey chin and they have white \u2018military like\u2019 moustaches. Patas monkeys grow to be 85 centimetres in length, excluding the tail, which measures 75 centimetres and weigh on average 18 pounds when fully grown. Like all Old World monkeys, they have well-developed hands with an opposable thumb. The Patas monkey is also known as \u2018Dancing monkey\u2019, \u2018Hussar monkey\u2019, \u2018Military monkey\u2019, \u2018Red monkey\u2019 and \u2018Sergeant-major monkey\u2019. Male Patas monkeys have proportionally the longest canines of any primate.A Patas monkey troop generally has only one adult male monkey and 4 to 10 female monkeys. Other Patas males either live alone or in bachelor groups. The highest-ranking female is in charge of the troop, not the male.The male Patas monkey spends much of his time perched high in trees or rock outcroppings, on the lookout for predators and other dangers. Males that live in the bachelor groups will occasionally approach a troop of females and set about their single male monkey in an attempt to drive him away and take his place. Such incidents are quite frequent and biologically desirable in that they prevent inbreeding.When relaxed, Patas monkeys lean back and put their feet up. Although generally quiet, Patas monkeys will bark upon meeting another troop. Patas monkeys avoid woodlands and live in treeless savanna and semi-deserts. They range from Senegal to Ethiopia and south to Tanzania. Patas monkeys are omnivores but are especially dependent on the pods, seeds, gall, young leaves, gum and flowers of acadia trees.They also eat grasses, berries, seeds, fruits, insects, eggs, lizards, tubers and young birds. The Patas monkey can store as much food in its cheeks as it can fit into its stomach.The Patas monkey has a life span of 15 to 20 years in the wild and over 20 years in captivity. Female Patas monkeys reach sexual maturity at about 2 and a half years of age. Males become sexually mature at between 3 and a half and 4 and a half years old. Gestation period lasts approximately 167 days, after which the female gives birth to one single offspring.Primary predators of Patas monkeys include leopards, cheetahs, eagles, hyenas and jackals. If a predator approaches, the ever-watchful male Patas monkeys create a diversionary display. Bouncing noisily on bushes or trees, he draws attention to himself and away from the females and young. This gives the rest of the troop time to silently flee or to hide in the long grass. Additionally, the coloration of Patas enables them to use their savanna surroundings as camouflage.Patas monkeys are not listed as an endangered or threatened species although habitat destruction and heavy cattle grazing and the conversion of savanna areas into farmland have reduced available habitat for Patas monkeys.However, in some instances, deforestation has converted once humid areas into drier savanna zones. In turn, this actually increases suitable habitat for Patas monkeys."

            "desc": "An Alligator is a crocodilian in the genus \u2018Alligator\u2019 of the family \u2018Alligatoridae\u2019. Alligators are large, semi-aquatic carnivorous reptiles with four small legs and a very large, long tail. The tail is half the animals total length. Alligators tails help propel them rapidly through the water and is used to make pools of water during the dry seasons called \u2018gator holes\u2019. The tail is also used as a weapon and stores fat that the alligator will use for nourishment during the winter. Alligators are cold blooded (ectothermic) and like most reptiles they do not make their own body heat. Alligators gain body heat by basking in the sun moving between hot and cool locations. Alligators, like many reptiles are \u2018plantigrade\u2019. This means that they walk in a flat-footed manner. On land, they can run and move very fast, but only in short bursts.",
            "behaviour": "Large male Alligators are solitary, territorial reptiles. Smaller Alligators can often be found in large numbers in close proximity to each other. The largest of the species (both males and females), will defend prime territory whereas smaller Alligators have a higher tolerance of other Alligators within a similar size class.Although Alligators have heavy bodies and slow metabolisms, they are capable of short bursts of speed that can exceed 30 miles per hour, though this could more properly be classified as a short fast lunge rather than a dash. Alligators main prey are smaller animals that they can kill and eat with a single bite. Alligators may kill larger prey by grabbing it and dragging it in the water to drown.Alligators consume food that cannot be eaten in one bite by allowing it to rot or by biting and then spinning or convulsing wildly until bite-size pieces are torn off. This is referred to as the \u2018death roll\u2019. Most of the muscle in an alligators jaw is intended for biting and gripping prey. The muscles for opening their jaws are relatively weak. As a result an adult man can hold an alligators jaw shut with his bare hands.\u00a0",
            "diet": "Alligators are nocturnal and feed primarily at night. Younger alligators eat insects, shrimps, snails, small fish, tadpoles and frogs. Adult alligators eat fish, birds, turtles, other reptiles and mammals. Alligators swallow their prey whole. Their conical teeth are used for catching the prey, not tearing it apart. Alligators have about 80 teeth and when an alligator loses a tooth, it regrows.\u00a0",
            "reproduction": "Alligators do not sit on their eggs, which are laid in nests, because it would crush them. The rotting vegetation in the nest warms the eggs. The temperature of the nest determines the sex of the hatchlings. If the eggs are incubated over 93 degrees Fahrenheit (34 degrees Celsius), the embryo develops as a male; temperatures below 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) result in female embryos. Between these temperatures, both sexes are produced. The natural sex ratio at hatching is five females to one male. The eggs hatch in two months, producing hatchlings about 6 inches long (15 centimetres). The female defends the nest from predators. A group of babies is called a \u2018pod\u2019. The female alligator will provide protection for the young for about a year if they remain in the area. Alligators are among the most nurturing of the reptiles.The average life span of an Alligator is around 35 \u2013 50 years old, although it is said they can live to a maximum of 80 years old. This is more possible of Alligators living in captivity.\u00a0",
            "history and evolution": "Crocodyloformes (the group encompassing crocodylians and other similar but extinct reptiles) evolved during the Triassic Period, about 248 million years ago. Crocodylians (a group which includes alligators, crocodiles, gharials or gavials, caiman) appeared during the Cretaceous period, about 98 million years ago, towards the end of the Mesozoic Era, the Age of Reptiles.\u00a0Deinosuchus (meaning \u2018terrible crocodile\u2019) was the largest crocodylian, growing up to 50 feet (15 metres) long. It lived during the late Cretaceous period (about 146 to 65 million years ago). This carnivore lived on the shores of the large shallow sea called the Tethys Sea, that covered much of North America. It survived on fish and perhaps some species of dinosaurs.Very few Deinosuchus fossils have been found.What is a group of Alligators Called?A group of Alligators is called a congregation."

Following the spawn, their young subsequently return to the sea to grow and a few live permanently in fresh waters. Allis and Twaite Shad fish are the only two members of the herring family found in fresh water in the UK. Both resemble large herring (adults can be over 2 kilograms in weight) and were formerly eaten in Britain before numbers declined and the fisheries collapsed."

The male ibex is commonly larger and heavier than the female. Ibexes have short, but not shaggy coats that vary in color from reddish brown in the winter to brownish grey in the summer. The male ibex has a beard on his chin. Ibexes are remarkably sure-footed and agile which enables them to leap about rocky ledges.",
            "habitat": "Ibexes are found on craggy terrains between the timber and snow lines above the alpine forests of the European Alps. Ibexes tend to occupy steep, rocky habitats at elevations of between 6,500 \u2013 15,000 feet (2,000 \u2013 4,600 metres). The ibexes have a unique hoof structure making it an excellent climber on steep rocks.",
            "ibex diet": "Ibexes are herbivores and rely mainly on grass, flowers, twigs and moss to survive. Ibex also often stand on their hind legs to reach leaves and shoots from trees. They come down from their steep habitats during late afternoon and evenings to the alpine meadows below to feed. However, in the winter, ibexes tend to live at lower altitudes when food is more scarce. During the summer, ibexes need to drink water every other day and therefore seek regions where there is a dependable water source.",
            "ibex behaviour": "Ibexes are diurnal and live in bachelor groups in herds of 10 \u2013 20 individuals. These male and female herds will only join together during the mating season.Being able to climb to great heights is also an ibexes defence technique as very few predators can follow them to the steepest regions of their habitat. Ibexes predators include wolves, bears, foxes and lynxes. If ibexes sense danger, they raise up on their very strong hind legs and point their horns towards their predators. Small kids (young ibex) are also susceptible to attacks from large predatory birds such as eagles.The ibexes receives help with their grooming habits from birds called Gackles who peck parasites from their coats.Like most goats, the ibex sprays itself with its own urine which gives it a strong body odour.",
            "ibex reproduction": "Breeding season for the ibex begins in late autumn when the male enters into what is known as \u2018the rut\u2019. At this time, males will separate from their bachelor herds and go their own way to seek out a female herd. During breeding season, fight rituals occur between males in order to determine who is entitled to breed with available females. Physical damage is rare during the rituals despite the males having large, heavy horns.The gestation period of the female ibex is around 6 months (150 \u2013 180 days) after which a single kid is born (twins rarely occur), usually during the month of May. Ibexes can live up to 20 years.",
            "conservation status": "By the beginning of the 19th century the Ibex was practically extinct, being hunted for its supposed mystical qualities.

The Amazon river dolphin is the only living genus in its family, with the family Iniidae containing four extinct genera. Three subspecies of Amazon river dolphin are currently recognized: I. g. geoffrensis (Amazon river dolphin), I. g. boliviensis (Bolivian river dolphin) and I. g. humboldtiana (Orinoco river dolphin), which are distributed in the Amazon basin, the upper Madeira River in Bolivia, and the Orinoco basin, respectively. The Amazon river dolphin is the largest species of river dolphin, with adult males reaching 185 kilograms (408 lb) in weight, and 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) in length. They also have one of the widest ranging diets among toothed whales, and feed on up to 53 different species of fish, such as croakers, catfish, tetras and piranhas.",
            "lifespan": "The life span of an Amazon river dolphin in the wild is unknown. In captivity, they have lived to between 10 and 30 years old. However, the average longevity in captive animals is only 33 months.\u00a0",
            "diet": "The Amazon river dolphin has a very diverse diet and is the most diverse of the toothed whales. It consists of at least 53 different species of fish, grouped in 19 families. Their prey is usually between 5 and 80 centimetres (2.0 and 31.5 in) in size, and they most commonly eat fish from the families Sciaenidae (drums or croakers), Cichlidae (cichlids), Characidae (characins and tetras), and Serrasalmidae (piranhas). However, they will also eat river turtles and crabs. If their prey is too large, they will break it up before eating.This species of river dolphin is a solitary feeder, usually feeding early in the morning and in the late afternoon. They consume about 5.5% of their body weight every day. They mostly prey near waterfalls and river mouths where river currents disrupt schools of fish and make them easier to catch.Their diet is most diverse during the wet season, when the fish spread out into the floodplain and are more difficult to catch, and becomes more selective during the dry season when fish densities are higher.\u00a0",
            "behavior": "The Amazon river dolphin is a typically solitary animal, but can be seen in pairs or in threes (usually mother and calves). Sometimes, they are seen in pods, but these rarely contain more than eight individuals. Pods as large as 37 individuals have been seen in the Amazon, but average is three.The river dolphin is most likely to be seen with other individuals in the summer, in areas with abundant food, and at the mouths of rivers.These animals do not seem to have a social hierarchy, but violent acts are common between the dolphins, which can result in harm or even death. They are curious animals and are afraid of foreign objects.They have been known to be playful though, too, and it is not unusual for them to rub against canoes and grasp canoe paddles, and they have been seen pulling grass under water, throwing sticks, and playing with logs and smaller animals.The Amazon river dolphin is a slow simmer, usually travelling at speeds of 1.5 to 3.2 kilometres per hour (0.93 to 1.99 mph), although they have been recorded to swim at speeds up to 14 to 22 kilometres per hour (8.7 to 13.7 mph).Breathing takes place every 30 to 110 seconds. They do not dive very deep, and they rarely raise their flukes out of the water. When they surface, the tips of the snout, melon and dorsal fins appear simultaneously, and their tail rarely shows before diving. Only occasionally will they jump out of the water, but they can jump as high as (3.14 ft).In captivity, these dolphins are very difficult to train, which is uncommon for a dolphin species. They are also much more shy than animals such as bottlenose dolphins.Most Amazon river dolphins are sedentary and, although they undertake seasonal migrations correlated with water level and fish abundance, these trips are small and not far from the areas in which they inhabit for the rest of the year.\u00a0",
            "communication and echolocation": "Amazonian rivers are often very murky, and the Amazon river dolphins likely use echolocation for navigation and to catch prey when they cannot use their sight. 45 kHz is the dominant frequency, which is not much different from the frequency of the bottlenose dolphin, although the clicks can range from 16-170 kHz. They\u2019re also used as communication between individuals. These dolphins use whistling tones too as another form of communication.\u00a0",
            "reproduction": "It is unclear whether Amazon river dolphins are monogamous or not, but it is thought they most likely are not. Very aggressive sexual behavior in males has been observed, and they often have damaged fins, flukes, and blowholes due to biting and abrasion, which may indicate there is intense competition for access to females.Males seem to initiate sexual activity by nibbling at the flippers or flukes of females, but if the females are not receptive, they might respond aggressively.Breedings is seasonal and takes place between May and June. This birthing period corresponds with peak water levels in rivers, and since females remain in flooded areas longer than males, this offers several advantages. As water levels begin to decrease, the density of prey items in flooded areas begins to increase due to loss of habitat.The gestation period for an Amazon river dolphin is about 11 months. Birthing is estimated to take between 4 to 5 hours and mothers give birth to single calves. Once the umbilical cords break, the mothers help their calves to the surface for air. The calves are about 0.80 m long at birth and are usually gray in color. They nurse for about a year, and are thought to be independent within two to three years.Male Amazon river dolphins reach sexual maturity at about 2.0 m in length, while females attain sexual maturity when they are 1.60-1.75 m long.Females usually give birth every 15 to 36 months and several individuals are known to have been lactating and pregnant simultaneously. It is thought that the bond between the mothers and her young is very strong, as pairs or groups in the wild usually consist of a mother and her calves.\u00a0Amazon River Dolphin Location and HabitatThe Amazon river dolphin is the most widespread of river dolphins. They are present in six countries in South America: Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela, in an area covering about 7,000,000 square kilometres (2,700,000 sq mi). Their distribution is limited mainly by marine waters, impassable rapids, waterfalls, and excessively shallow parts of the rivers.Within these waters, the Amazon river dolphin can be found in main rivers, small channels, river basins, canals, mouths of rivers, lakes, and just below waterfalls and rapids. The water level cycle exerts the strongest influence on habitat use by these dolphins during different parts of the year; in the dry season, the dolphins are usually located in the river beds, but in the rainy season, when the rivers overflow, they disperse to the flooded areas, both the forests and the plains.Males and females appear to have different habitat preferences, with males returning to main river channels while water levels are still rising and females and their calves remaining in the flooded areas as long as possible. This may be due to the calmer waters preventing the younger river dolphins from being swept away, allowing them to rest and fish in a quieter environment. The lack of males in the area at this time may also be another factor for choosing to remain in the flooded areas \u2014 there is a lower risk of aggression and predation from other species.Amazon River Dolphin Conservation StatusThe Amazon river dolphin is classified as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Humans are to blame for the decline in these animals. Issues such as climate change, deforestation and killing by fisherman are the most likely causes for the dwindling numbers.The Amazon river dolphin species has historically been kept in dolphinariums. Today, only one exists in captivity, at Zoologico de Guistochoca in Peru. These animals do not do well in captivity, with the last river dolphin kept in a US zoo dying in 2002. Unfortunately, if river dolphin numbers begin to dwindle to dangerously low levels in the wild, it would be alarming because populations may not be able to be maintained for long in captivity.As fishing technologies have improved, the accidental catching of these river dolphins has greatly increased. During the process of catching the commercialized fish, the Amazon river dolphins get caught in the fishing nets and exhaust themselves until they die, or the local fishermen deliberately kill the entangled dolphins. The carcasses are discarded, consumed, or used as bait to attract a scavenger catfish. They have also been harpooned, shot, and poisoned for stealing fish out of nets and damaging the fishing equipment. In 2008, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) expressed concern for captured river dolphins for use as bait in the Central Amazon, which is an emerging problem that has spread on a large scale.As pollution and deforestation increases, it has more and more of an effect of Amazon river dolphins. An altering to their environment can reduce hunting, feeding and reproduction levels. What\u2019s more, the bigger the demand for fish for human consumption, the more fish that are caught and the less fish there are for this endangered species.",

Amazonian manatees are aquatic animals. The Amazonian manatee come from the \u2018Sirenia\u2019 order and are also known as \u2018seacows\u2019.  The Amazonian manatees color is brownish grey and they have thick, wrinkled skin, often with coarse hair, or \u2018whiskers\u2019. Its main predator is man. The three species of manatees and the closely related Dugong, are unique in that they are the only plant-eating marine mammals in modern times.",

The three species of manatees and the closely related Dugong, are unique in that they are the only plant-eating marine mammals in modern times.A somewhat unique feature (amongst mammals) of the manatee is the constant replacement of molar teeth. New teeth enter at the back of the jaw and replace old and worn teeth at the front. Elephants also have teeth that are replaced, but they have a limited set of these replacement teeth.",
            "diet": "The Amazonian manatee is a herbivore that feeds on aquatic vegetation near lake edges, such as aquatic grasses, and floating vegetation such as water lilies. Captive adults daily consume from 9 \u2013 15 kilograms (20 \u2013 33 pounds) of leafy vegetables.",
            "habitat": "The Amazonian manatee occurs exclusively in fresh water. It prefers blackwater lakes, oxbows and lagoons and it has been maintained successfully in waters with temperatures of 22 \u2013 30 deg C (72 \u2013 86 deg F). The Amazonian manatees key requirements in the wild seem to be large blackwater lakes or lagoons with deep connections to large rivers and abundant aquatic vegetation.",
            "behaviour": "The Amazonian manatee is both diurnal (active during the day) and nocturnal (active during the night).\u00a0 The Amazonian manatee is entirely aquatic and never leaves the water. Amazonian manatees do most of their feeding during the wet season, when they eat new vegetation in seasonally flooded backwaters. During the dry season (September \u2013 March), when they congregate in the main river channels or in deep parts of larger lakes, they may fast for weeks or months for lack of available food plants. There have been reports of larger aggregations of manatees in the middle reaches of the Amazon, but the largest groups of manatees observed currently generally include only 4 \u2013 8 animals. Most manatees observed are either solitary or a female with her young.",
            "range": "The Amazonian manatee ranges throughout the Amazon River Basin of northern South America.\u00a0 Its range sometimes has been said to include the Orinoco River Basin, but such reports apparently are based on misidentification of the American manatee in the early 19th century. The Amazonian manatee is also unlikely to reach the waters that connect the Orinoco and Amazon basins. It occurs at the mouth of the Amazon on the Atlantic coast.",
            "reproduction": "The gestation period of the Amazonian manatee is approximately one year.Breeding has been reported to occur throughout the year in some areas. However, it has been reported that births occur mainly in January in one part of Amazonian Ecuador and in June in another. Evidence also indicates that in the central Amazon Basin, breeding is seasonal, with nearly all births taking place from December to July (mainly from February \u2013 May, the period of rising river levels).One manatee calf is born with a birth interval of about two years. An Amazonian manatee calf measures about 30 inches (80 centimetres). The newborn calf is capable of swimming to the surface on its own. Calves vocalize at or soon after birth. This is an important part of the mother-calf bonding process. The manatee calf begins to nurse within a few hours after birth by suckling from a teat under the pectoral flippers. Calves nurse underwater. Calves begin nibbling on plants within a few weeks of birth. Although it may be weaned by the end of its first year, the calf remains close to its mother for up to two years. The manatee calf is dependent on its mother not only for nutrition, but also for learning about feeding and resting areas, travel routes and warm-water refuges. Female manatees carry calves on their backs or clasped to their side. Life span of a manatee can be up to 12 and a half years.",
            "conservation and threats": "The Amazonian Manatee is considered endangered by the IUCN. The Amazonian manatee has been heavily hunted by subsistence and commercial hunters.\u00a0 It has been sought for meat, oil and fat, and at one time for its hide, which was in demand for use as water hoses and machine belts. Other threats include accidental drowning in commercial fishing nets and degradation of food supplies by soil erosion resulting from deforestation. Amazonian manatee hunting has been prohibited since 1973."

            "desc": "The American badger (Taxidea taxus) is a badger belonging to the Mustelidae family, a diverse family of carnivorous mammals that also includes weasels, otters, ferrets, and the wolverine. The American badger is similar in appearance to the European badger, although not closely related, and can be found in the western, central, and northeastern United States, northern Mexico, and south-central Canada to certain areas of southwestern British Columbia. It belongs to the subfamily Taxidiinae, one of four subfamilies of mustelid badgers \u2013 the other three being the Melinae (four species in two genera, including the European badger), the Helictidinae (five species of ferret-badgers) and the Mellivorinae (the honey badger). The American badger\u2019s genus is Taxidea. American badgers generally resemble common badgers in terms of their appearance. They largely reside in open grasslands where there is a lot of prey for them to eat \u2014 animals such as mice, squirrels and groundhogs make up most of their diet.",
            "lifespan": "In the wild, badgers are estimated to live for between 4 and 10 years. However, they can live up to 14 years old. In captivity, they have lived up to 26 years.",
            "diet": "American badgers are carnivores and mostly eat pocket gophers, ground squirrels, moles, marmots, woodrats, prairie dogs, deer mice, voles and kangaroo rats. They will also eat lizards, rattlesnakes, amphibians, carrion, fish, hibernating animals, ground nesting birds, such as bank swallows and burrowing owls, and some plant foods, such as corn and sunflower seeds.Badgers do not stalk their prey, but instead prey by digging. They can dig very quickly, as their forelimbs allow them to power through soil and even harder surfaces such as concrete! They use their strength to tunnel after ground dwelling animals. They have also been known to store and hoard food.",
            "behavior": "Badgers are generally solitary animals that are active at night. They are fairly inactive in the winter months, and, although they do not hibernate, they spend much of the winter sleeping in their burrows. During this time they let their body temperatures fall to about 9 degrees Celsius and their heart beats at about half the normal rate.American badgers have excellent vision, scent, and hearing, and it is also thought they have nerve endings in the foreclaws that may make them especially sensitive to touch in their forepaws. Little is known about how they communicate, but it is thought that they most likely use their scent to communicate.",
            "reproduction": "While badgers are solitary, they will seek out mates during the breeding season. During this time, in late summer and early fall, they will expand their range to find a mate. Males have larger home ranges that are likely to overlap with the home ranges of several females, and so may mate with more than one female.After copulation, implantation is delayed until December or as late as February. After this period embryos implant into the uterine wall and resume development. While the gestation period of the badger is only 6 weeks, this actually means that the female badgers are pregnant for 7 months!Female badgers give birth in grass-lined dens. They give birth to a litter size of between 1 and 5, but the average is 3. The badger young are born blind, with only a thin coat of fur, and their eyes only open at 4 to 6 weeks old. They are nursed by their mother until they are 2 to 3 months old, after which they are given solid food, both before and after they are weaned.American badger young will emerge from the den at 5 to 6 weeks old and will stay with their mothers until they are 5 to 6 months old. While males are not sexually mature until the autumn of their second year, females are able to mate when they are 4 months old. Most female American badgers become pregnant for the first time after they are a year old.\u00a0American Badger Location and HabitatAmerican badgers are found in the Great Plains region of the United States and across western, and northeastern North America. They are also found through the central western Canadian provinces and south throughout the mountainous areas of Mexico. Since the turn of the 20th century, the badger range has expanded and they are now found as far east as Ontario, Canada.Badgers prefer to live in dry, open grasslands, fields, and pastures. These areas give them good access to their prey. They may also be found in forest glades and meadows, marshes, brushy areas, hot deserts, and mountain meadows. They are sometimes found at elevations up to 12,000 feet (3,700 m) but are usually found in the Sonoran and Transition life zones (which are at elevations lower and warmer than those characterized by coniferous forests).A badger\u2019s home range can vary depending on the season, which can alter the amount of food available. Males generally have larger home ranges than females.American badgers require cover for sleep, concealment, protection from weather, and natal denning. They typically enlarge foraged out gopher dens or other prey holes, or other animal burrows. Badger burrows range from about 4 feet to 10 feet in depth and 4 feet to 6 feet in width. A female American badger may create 2 to 4 burrows in proximity with a connecting tunnel for concealment and safety for her young.In winter, a single den may be used for most of the season, but, in summer and fall, badgers range more frequently and may abandon their dens every week or so and find a new one. Natal dens are dug by the female and are used for extended periods, but litters may be moved, probably to allow the mother to forage in new areas close to the nursery.American Badger Conservation StatusAmerican badgers are not considered to be endangered as they are quite widespread across their range. They are listed as Least Concern by the IUCN.Badgers are important consumers of many small prey items in their ecosystem. They help to control rodent populations, kill venomous snakes, and eat insects and carrion. Their burrows provide shelter for other species and their digging activity helps in soil development.The main predators of badgers are humans. The American badger is hunted much more frequently by humans that it is by other animals. They are caught by humans for their pelts, which is used for brushes and painting brushes. In some parts of North America, including Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, and British Columbia, badgers are protected from hunting by law.",
            "predators": "Predators of American badgers are uncommon, but golden eagles, bobcats, cougars and coyotes have been recorded to prey on these animals. Bears and grey wolves may also sometimes take badgers. However, badger young are much more likely to be taken than adult badgers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

It is often called the sparrow hawk, not to be confused with the Eurasian Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) which is a different bird of prey species entirely. It is found throughout most of the American continent, from Alaska and Canada to as far south as Panama in South America. There are 17 subspecies across its entire range, each having adapted to different environments. Some of the subspecies that live in the Northern extremes of Canada and Alaska are migratory, while others are not. The American Kestrel is a bird of prey, and has a diet of mostly insects, small lizards and rodents, and also small birds such as sparrows (hence the name).",
            "characteristics": "The American kestrel is a small, agile falcon. It is not as muscular or stocky as other falcons, which has its own benefits for how this bird likes to hunt.The most notable differences between the male and female American kestrel, is in the feathers of the tail, wings, and chest.Females have a light brown to rufous back and wings, with a barred pattern of darker brown. The breast and belly are pale with dark brown streaky spots. The tail is a similar color to the back, with many narrow black bands.Males on the other hand, have bluish-grey feathers in the wing, with black spots throughout. The underside of the wings are white. They have a reddish-brown (rufous) back, with a much lighter, creamy colored belly. The tail of the male is also reddish-brown, but with a single black terminal band.In both males and females, the head is small with white cheeks, slate-grey on top, with two vertical black stripes on the face.In terms of size, the American Kestrel ranges from 8.7 to 12.2 inches (22 \u2013 31 cm) in length, and 20 to 24 inches (51 \u2013 61 cm) across the wingspan.Females are larger than males, and the subspecies of American kestrel that live furthest north are larger than those that live in more temperate, lower latitude areas. This complies with the bergmann\u2019s rule.",

It prefers open habitats such as fields, meadows, and savannas, but can also be found in more urban settings such as parks and vacant lots.The American kestrel typically nests in cavities in trees, cliffs, or buildings. It will also use nest boxes, and will sometimes steal the nests of other birds such as red-tailed hawks, crows, titmice and merlins.",
            "diet": "The American Kestrel is not a fussy eater. It has a wide diet, which varies across its range depending on availability. It is this wide diet, and ability to survive on smaller prey and fewer meals, that has been partly attributed to their wide success as a species.They are known to eat small rodents such as mice and short-tailed shrews, as well as small lizards and reptiles. Insects are also a common food source, particularly earthworms, grasshoppers, dragonflies, beetles, butterflies and moths.These birds of prey will also eat smaller birds, like sparrows and starlings, but are also capable of grabbing larger birds like pigeons. They are known to prey on easy targets, such as small birds eating from bird feeders in groups. That is one of the reasons why you should never have a bird box near a bird feeder. Doing so makes an easy target out of a nesting family of birds.American Kestrels are ambush hunters. They have leaner bodies than other birds of prey that hunt in flight. They are not built that type of energy-intensive hunting, and are most likely to be found perching on a branch or fence post and scanning the ground for prey. When it sees an animal, it will dive down and capture it with its talons.They will also hunt birds by hovering at height and diving down, rather than engaging with a lengthy chase. They are more likely to eat other birds in urban areas than rurally where easier and smaller prey are available.",
            "behaviour": "The American kestrel is a solitary bird, except during the breeding season. Of those that do migrate, they usually do so alone, though they are also spotted in small flocks too.They are known to nest year on year in the same territory, and in some cases the same nest. Particularly where a nest has been very successful in the past. In populations that are non migratory (sedentary) they are known to stay around the nesting site year round.It is a vocal bird, with a variety of calls that it uses to communicate with other kestrels at different times. These vocalizations can be categorised into three sounds:\u2018Klee\u2019 \u2013 Used in situations where the bird is upset or excited. Usually in a series of repetitive \u2018klees\u2019.\u2018Whine\u2019 \u2013 Generally used when feeding or during sex\u2018Chitter\u2019 \u2013 Used during courtship, particularly around feeding, sex and care for the youngThose that live in Central and South America tend to be local breeders, non migratory. Those that breed in the Norther parts of Canada, and the USA usually migrate south for the winter.",
            "\u2019s use in falconry": "The American kestrel is widely used in Falconry, and is noted for being particularly good for beginners learning the skill. They are particularly renowned for their success at capturing game birds such as quail. They are particularly advantageous to the craft in urban areas or small areas that don\u2019t have the range for getting the best out of larger falconry birds.",
            "reproduction": "Mating pairs will often perch close to each other and preen each other. Courtship usually happens through displays of skilful flight and feeding their prospective partner. Copulation typically lasts about 10 seconds.The female lays 3-7 eggs across a period of 24\u201372 hours. She then incubates the eggs for 28-32 days. The young fledge at 30-35 days of age, but they will have reached their adult weight from around 16-17 days \u2013 they grow quick!By their first year, they are considered adults and will have reached sexual maturity.

The American oystercatcher belongs to the genus Haematopus and the order Charadriiformes. The bird is characterized by its black and white body and a long, thick orange bill. It was originally called the \u201csea pie\u201d, but was renamed in 1731 when naturalist Mark Catesby observed the bird eating oysters. The IUCN Red List labels the American oystercatcher as Least Concern, as the total number of individuals is believed to be stable, and actually increasing in the case of the United States. Despite this, in some states the bird is listed as a species of concern because of low and declining populations.",
            "american oystercatcher lifespan": "The American oystercatcher has an average lifespan of around 17 years.",
            "american oystercatcher diet": "The American oystercatcher feed mainly on marine invertebrates, bivalves, mollusks, mussels, oysters, worms, clams, crabs and shell fish. They will also eat small fish. Using their long and strong beaks, they are able to open crab shells and oyster shells.They use two feeding methods \u2014 \u201cstabbing\u201d, where a bird walks around an exposed shellfish bed until it spots an open bivalve, which it quickly stabs, and \u201chammering\u201d, in which the bird simply plucks a single mussel from a group of mussels, takes it to a different location, and holds it in its beak in such a way that when it begins hammering, the shell breaks easily.Stabbing can be dangerous, and the oystercatchers are sometimes drowned when they don\u2019t completely sever the muscle that causes the shell to clamp shut.American Oystercatchers patrol the beaches for food and are somewhat approachable, they actually come close to the tourists. Chicks are often seen trying to get their own food when just a few weeks old. This behaviour is typical of shore birds who are less dependant on their parents than sea birds.",
            "american oystercatcher behavior": "The American oystercatcher is a social species and tend to roost communally in groups containing up to 100 or more individuals. During the day, these birds can be seen running or walking more often than flying.Their normal flight pattern is rapid and deep wing beats. This becomes softer during courtship displays and when predators are nearby. Much of their daily routine is spent preening, head scratching, sleeping, standing and sunbathing.These birds are very vocal. Their call is loud, rising, and then descending. It is used for a variety of purposes including: greetings between individuals, warning alarms, territorial disputes, establishing dominance in feeding areas, and begging for food from parents.",
            "american oystercatcher reproduction": "The American oystercatcher is typically monogamous. They attract their mates by performing courtship displays that include both visual and auditory aspects. Courting birds walk parallel to one another while holding their necks outstretched, looking downwards, and making a loud piping call. Breeding is usually initiated by the female, who stiffens her body, raises her tail, straightens her legs, bends forwards, and draws in her neck. The male responds to this change in posture by mounting the female for 1 to 2 seconds.Breeding usually happens between February and July and raise one brood per summer. Both the male and the female are involved in nest building, brooding, incubation, and nest defense. They create a nest in shallow scrapes along the ground, which are usually located on salt marshes, rocky shores, or beaches. Their nest sites generally range from 1 to 2 m above sea level.Oystercatchers usually raise a clutch of two or three eggs. They hatch after around 24 to 28 days. Chicks are precocial and leave the nest within 24 hours of hatching. Both parents feed the chicks until they fledge, which is normally after 35 days. Chicks rely on their parents for food until their bills become strong enough to probe and stab. The parents will retrieve soft parts of marine invertebrates and either carry them back or eat and regurgitate them for their young.Some juveniles remain with their parents for up to 6 months. They become sexually mature between three and four years of age.",
            "american oystercatcher migration": "Oystercatchers are typically short-distance migrants. Breeding birds from South Carolina to Florida generally do not migrate, but will leave breeding territories to join local roosting flocks during the non-breeding season. Northern breeders move south, probably to southeastern United States, for the winter.",
            "american oystercatcher location and habitat": "The American oystercatcher has a far spreading range across the world and they can be found in the United States, Cuba, Brazil, and Mexico. These birds are the only species native to the Atlantic Coast of North America. They can be found year-round throughout parts of the Caribbean and the Gulf Coast.Along the Atlantic Coast, the American oystercatchers breeding range spans between Massachusetts and Florida. In South America, this species occurs as far south as Chile and Argentina. They are also found locally on both coasts of Mexico and Central America and on the Galapagos Islands.The American oystercatcher is a common sight on rocky and sandy beaches, saltwater lagoons and mudflats. In the winter, they are more concentrated in areas with abundant food sources such as reefs, oyster beds, or clam flats. During spring and fall migration, these birds can be found on shellfish beds, sand flats, or intertidal mudflats. They very rarely venture inland.American Oystercatcher Conservation StatusAmerican oystercatchers are listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Despite this, in some states American oystercatchers are listed as a species of concern because of low and declining populations. They are vulnerable to loss of habitat due to development on the coasts, as well as climate change.These birds are also threatened by pollution, disease, and invasive species which can impact food availability. Historically, the American oystercatcher was hunted to near extinction in the 19th century for plumage and eggs. They have recovered significantly since the passage of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in 1918.American Oystercatchers patrol the beaches for food and are somewhat approachable.

            "desc": "Anacondas are four species of aquatic boa inhabiting the swamps and rivers of the dense forests of tropical South America. The Yellow Anaconda can be found as far south as Argentina. It is unclear how the name originated so far from the snakes native habitat. It is likely due to its vague similarity to the large Asian pythons. Local names for the Anaconda in South America include the Spanish term \u2018matatoro\u2019, meaning \u2018bull killer\u2019, and the Native American terms \u2018sucuri\u2019 and \u2018yakumama\u2019. Anacondas as members of the boa family are sometimes called \u2018water boas\u2019. The Latin name for Anaconda is \u2018Eunectes\u2019 meaning \u2018good swimmer\u2019. There is some debate about the maximum size of Anacondas and there have been unverified claims of enormous snakes alleged to be as long as 30 \u2013 45 metres (98.4 \u2013 147.6 feet). Some Anacondas, which live in the water, can reach up to 30 feet in length.",

            "": "The Yellow Anaconda (Eunectes notaeus), is native to South America in countries such as Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, western Brazil and northeast Argentina. The Yellow Anaconda is smaller than the more well known Green Anaconda and reaches an average adult length of about 3 metres (9.8 feet).Yellow Anacondas have a yellow/brown base color with black blotches and rosettes. Yellow Anacondas live in mostly aquatic habitats including swamps, marshes and brush covered banks of slow moving rivers and streams.Just about every species of snake on earth has teeth, but the Anacondas teeth are not used for chewing. Most snakes teeth are used for holding onto their prey, preventing them from escaping. Some snakes have venom in two specially designed, extra long teeth which they use to kill their prey.Anacondas have teeth, however, they are not a venomous snake. They rely on their enormous size and power to subdue their victims. It is possible to be bitten by an Anaconda, but the bite itself would not be fatal.",
            "anaconda diet": "The Anaconda diet includes deer, wild pigs, birds and large rodents and also aquatic animals such as fish and reptiles (caiman). Anacondas swim well and kill their prey by strangling them. If that does not work, they drown them. These snakes can survive years without eating.Anacondas also typically feed on tapirs, capybaras, peccaries, turtles, sheep and even dogs. They have been known to occasionally prey on jaguars and attacks on humans can be confirmed, although this is rare.Anacondas swallow their prey whole, starting with the head. This is so the legs fold up and the prey goes down smoothly. The Anaconda can swallow prey much bigger than the size of its mouth since its jaw can unhinge and the jaw bones are loosely connected to the skull. While the snake eats, its muscles have wave-like contractions, crushing the prey even further and surging it downward with each bite.",
            "anaconda behaviour": "The Anaconda is most active at night which makes it a nocturnal reptile. Although they are not venomous, they defend themselves by inflicting severe bites, but actually kill its prey by constriction.Most local people kill these snakes on sight, out of the fear that they are man-eaters. In most instances, if an Anaconda senses humans in the area, it will retreat in another direction. Human death by an Anaconda is quite rare. Anacondas themselves are preyed by jaguars, large caimans and by other Anacondas. A wounded Anaconda can also fall prey to piranhas.",

            "desc": "For more than 100 million years, ants have been living on the Earth. They can be found almost anywhere on the planet. As of 2006, there are 11,880 known ant species, most of which reside in hot climates. Ants are members of the family of social insects which means they live in organised colonies. The family of ants is known as the Formicidae of the order: Hymenoptera (An order of highly specialized insects with complete metamorphosis that include the bees, wasps and ants that often associate in large colonies with complex social organization).",
            "ant characteristics": "There is a great diversity among ants and their behaviours. Ants range in size from 2 to about 25 millimetres (about 0.08 to 1 inch). Their color may vary, most are red or black, but other colors can also be seen, including some tropical groups with a metallic lustre.",
            "ant behaviour": "Ants are one of the most successful groups of insects in the animal kingdom. They are of particular interest because they are a social insect and form highly organized colonies or nests which sometimes consist of millions of individuals. Colonies of invasive ant species will sometimes work together and form super-colonies, spanning a very wide area of land. Ant colonies are sometimes described as superorganisms because they appear to operate as a single entity.Ants have colonized almost every landmass on Earth. They can constitute up to 15% of the total animal biomass of a tropical rainforest; in the Amazon the combined weight of the ants is said to be four times larger than that of the tetrapods in the same area. It has also been estimated that the combined weight of all ants exceeds the weight of mankind.",
            "and aphids": "Many ants eat the sweet fluid called \u2018honeydew\u2019 excreted by aphids. Some species keep and protect aphids \u2013 sometimes even in their own nests. Ants will transport aphids from plant to plant and take the eggs into their colony for the winter. Ants will also defend aphids from insect predators, such as lady beetles and lacewings, by attacking them in large numbers. Aphids are an ants favourite food!",
            "ant nests": "Ants are clean and tidy insects. Some worker ants are given the job of taking the rubbish from the nest and putting it outside in a special rubbish dump. Each colony of ants has its own smell. In this way, intruders can be recognized immediately. Many ants such as the common Red species have a sting which they use to defend their nest.Some species of ant are known for attacking and taking over the colonies of others ant species. Others are less expansionist but nonetheless just as aggressive; they attack colonies to steal eggs or larvae, which they either eat or raise as workers. Some ants, such as the Amazon Ants, are incapable of feeding themselves, but must rely on captured worker ants to care for them.",
            "ant communication": "Ant communication is accomplished primarily through chemicals called pheromones. Because most ants spend their time in direct contact with the ground, these chemical messages are more developed than in other Hymenopterans. So for instance, when a forager finds food, she will leave a pheromone trail along the ground on her way home. Home is typically located through the use of remembered landmarks and the position of the sun as detected with compound eyes and also by means of special sky polarization-detecting fibres within the eyes.",
            "and humans": "Ants are useful for clearing out insect pests and aerating the soil. On the other hand, they can become pests when they invade homes, yards, gardens and fields. Carpenter ants damage wood by hollowing it out for nesting. Nests may be destroyed by tracing the ant trails back to the nest, then pouring boiling water into it to kill the queen.Ordinary chalk can be used to keep ants at bay; drawing a line or circle around the protected area may prevent them from entering.In some parts of the world large ants have been used as sutures (stitches) by pressing the wound together and applying ants along it. The ant in defensive attitude seizes the edges in its mandibles and locks in place. The body is then cut off and the mandibles can remain in place for up to three days closing the wound.Some species, called killer ants, have a tendency to attack much larger animals during foraging or in defending their nests. Human attacks are rare, but the stings and bites can be quite painful and in large enough numbers can be disabling.",
            "the ant hill": "An ant hill, in its simplest form, is a pile of earth, sand, pine needles, or clay or a composite of these and other materials that build up at the entrances of the subterranean dwellings of ant colonies as they are develpoed. A colony is built and maintained by legions of worker ants, who carry tiny bits of dirt and vegetation in their mandibles and deposit them near the exit of the colony.Ants normally deposit the dirt or vegetation at the top of the hill to prevent it from sliding back into the colony.However, in some species they actively sculpt the materials into specific shapes and may create nest chambers within the mound.An ant colony is an underground lair where ants live. Colonies consist of a series of underground chambers, connected to each other and the surface of the earth by small tunnels. There are rooms for nurseries, food storage, and mating."

Arctic Wolves inhabit the Canadian Arctic and the northern parts of Greenland. The Arctic Wolf and the Timber Wolf are the only subspecies of the Grey Wolf that still can be found over the whole of its original range, largely because in their natural habitat they rarely encounter humans. \u00a0",
            "characteristics": "Arctic Wolves generally are smaller than Grey Wolves, measuring around 3 to 6 feet (0.9 to 1.8 metres) long including the tail. Male Arctic Wolves are larger than female Arctic Wolves. Their shoulder heights vary from 25 to 31 inches (63 to 79 centimetres).Arctic Wolves are bulkier than Grey Wolves, often weighing over 100 pounds (45 kilograms). Weights of up to 175 pounds (80 kilograms) have been observed in full-grown males.Arctic Wolves usually have small ears, which help the wolf maintain body heat. The alpha male is always the largest and will continue growing after other wolves had stopped. Arctic wolves can be black, grey or white.\u00a0",
            "hunting": "Arctic wolves, like all wolves, hunt in packs. They mostly prey on Caribou and musk oxen, however, they will also kill a number of Arctic Hares, seals, ptarmigan and lemmings, as well as other smaller animals. Moose are also common prey, their long legs may render them slow and at times, stuck, in thick snow, leaving them vulnerable to attacks by wolf packs.As grazing plants are scarce, they roam large areas to find prey up to and beyond 2600 kilometres squared (1000 square miles) and they will follow migrating caribou during the winter.\u00a0",
            "reproduction": "Normally, only the alpha male and female Arctic wolves breed, however, in large packs others may mate as well. Due to the Arctics permafrost soil and the difficulty it poses for digging dens, Arctic Wolves often use rock outcroppings, caves or even shallow depressions as dens instead.The mother gives birth to 2 or 3 pups in late May to early June, about a month later than Grey Wolves. It is generally thought that the lower number of pups compared to the average of 4 to 5 among Grey Wolves is due to the lack of prey in the Arctic. Female Arctic wolves have a gestation period of about 63 days. The wolf pups stay with their mother for 2 years.At birth, wolf pups tend to have darker fur and their eyes have blue irises that will change to a yellow-gold or orange color when the pups are between 8 and 16 weeks old. Though extremely unusual, it is possible for an adult wolf to retain its blue-colored irises.Arctic Wolves have achieved life spans of over 18 years in captivity; however, in the wild, the average life span is only 7 \u2013 10 years.\u00a0",
            "conservation status": "The Arctic Wolf is classed as \u2018Least Concern\u2019. The White Wolf Sanctuary is a refuge for Arctic wolves located in Tidewater, Oregon. The average population of wolves in the sanctuary is 8 \u2013 10 over 40 acres, of which some are rescued wolves who were injured, unwanted or abandoned."

With a natural defense system in place, the armadillo has been able to thrive for millions of years and can be found in the western hemisphere, in North, South and Central America. The scientific name for Armadillo is Dasypodidae. The armadillo is the only mammal to have a full developed shell, and types of armadillos can be distinguished from each other by the number of rings on their shell. There are nine extinct types, and 21 extant species, all native to the Americas. There are two main families of armadillos: Dasypodidae and Chlamyphoridae, with subfamilies of each.",
            "lifespan": "The lifespan of an armadillo ranges from four to twelve years. In captivity, they can even reach up to thirty years old!",
            "diet": "Armadillos are omnivores and the specific diet varies from species to species. However, generally, armadillos eat insects, grubs and other invertebrates. They do not have sharp incisors or canines and instead have short, flat teeth, so, most commonly, they eat small animals like ants and termites, as well as beetles, earthworms, cockroaches, wasps, spiders, snails and scorpions. Other sources of food include fruits, vegetation and eggs.They use their claws to find food, helped along with their excellent sense of smell. Their sense of smell makes up for their very poor eyesight. The armadillo has a remarkably long tongue, like the anteater, to suck up its prey hiding deep within the ground. This can cause havoc for farmers, as armadillos can ruin crops by searching for food!",
            "behavior": "Armadillos are generally solitary animals, especially when they are hunting and foraging, but will occasionally come together and socialize. However, this is usually only for breeding reasons or for huddling close together to keep warm when it is very cold.Armadillos are diggers and will use their sharp claws to create burrows in the ground. They line these burrows with leaves and vegetation and they provide the armadillo with a soft and comfortable home. They usually sleep for up to 16 hours in their burrow, and forage for food during the mornings and evenings.Armadillos have short legs but can move quite quickly, as fast as 30 mph. The nine-banded armadillo can also move well through water, even underwater, and can hold its breath for as long as six minutes. It can also capable of increasing its buoyancy by swallowing air, inflating its stomach and intestines.",
            "breeding": "Some species of armadillo breed all year round, while others only breed at specific times of the year. Male armadillos rely on their strong sense of smell to locate a potential mate.These animals have an interesting and unique reproduction cycle. The male has one of the largest penis sizes to body lengths among all mammals, and the females have the ability to delay implantation of the egg after copulation until food is more plentiful.Armadillos have a gestation period of 60 to 120 days, depending on the species, and usually give birth to four monozygotic young (identical quadruplets). However, litter sizes can vary between one to eight young. Their burrows can vary in size and can be up to 15 feet (4.5 m) wide.The long armadillos are born with soft, leathery skin which hardens within a few weeks, and they reach sexual maturity in three to twelve months, depending on the species.",
            "habitat": "Armadillos are endemic to the Americas, particularly Central America and South America. However, the nine-banded species is found in North America, too. The nine-banded armadillo is actually the official state animal of Texas. It is thought that, as the climate warms, armadillos may expand to northern United States and Canada.These animals live in grasslands, rainforests, wetlands, and semi-desert regions and, thanks to their diverse diet, they can live in many different places. Armadillos generally prefer sandy or loam soils that are loose and porous, as this makes digging for food a lot easier.Conservation StatusAccording to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), armadillos are not endangered. Their current population is unknown, but most species are not listed as under concern.That being said, some species are facing extinction, such as the Brazilian three-banded armadillo and the giant armadillo. This could be down to loss of habitat due to deforestation and loss of the rainforest.",
            "predators": "The biggest predators of armadillos are jaguars, coyotes, bobcats, wolves, bears, and large hawks. Their armor is their biggest means of defense, but they will also lash out with their claws or try to run away.Unfortunately, armadillos are sometimes hunted for their meat, especially in South America. They are also common roadkill due to their habit of jumping 3\u20134\u00a0ft vertically when startled, which puts them into collision with the underside of vehicles. They have even been known as the \u201cHillbilly Speed Bump\u201d for their tendency to get run over by vehicles.Armadillo shells have traditionally been used to make the back of the charango, an Andean lute instrument, too.Armadillos are naturally susceptible to several human diseases, including leprosy.Well Known Armadillo Species",

Its diet consists mainly of insects and plants, however, during the summer, it will also feed up on lizards, snakes and rodents.The screaming hairy armadillo has a gestation period is is 60 \u2013 75 days, with two young in a litter per year. Its sexual maturity is reached at 9 months.",
            "facts": "Armadillos belong to the order \u2018Cingulata\u2019. They are related to Anteaters and Sloths (superorder Xenarthra) who belong to the order \u2018Pilosa\u2019.The two groups can be separated in that Armadillos have an armoured upper body and Anteaters and Sloths have fur.There are around 20 species of Armadillo found in North and South America in various habitats from tropical rainforests to dry savannas and grasslands.The name Armadillo is spanish and means \u2018little armoured one\u2019.The most common and populated Armadillo is the Nine-banded Armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) who has extended its range in Central America due to lack of natural predators.They measure between 13 \u2013 150 centimetres and weigh between 85 grams \u2013 54 kilograms depending on species.The largest is the Giant Armadillo (Priodontes maximus) at 89 centimetres in length of which a third is its tail.The smallest is the Pink Fairy Armadillo (Chlamyphorus truncatus) at 90 \u2013 115 millimetres in length and pink/pale rose in color.Their armour is made from dermal bone which is covered in small, over-lapping epidermal scales called \u2018scutes\u2019.Their under parts are covered in soft skin and fur.Habitats can range from tropical rainforests to grasslands, dry deserts and savannas.They do not like cold weather because of their low metabolic rate and their lack of fat stores.Most Armadillos are omnivores.They are solitary, mostly nocturnal animals that do not share their burrows with other adult Armadillos.They are classed as a \u2018Threatened\u2019 species except for the Nine-banded Armadillo whose population is expanding.Major threats are habitat loss and over-hunting."

            "desc": "The Asian Elephant (Elephas Maximus),is found primarily in large parts of Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Indochina and parts of Indonesia. The Asian elephant is considered endangered, with between 25,600 and 32,750 individuals left in the wild. Asian elephants belong to the family of elephants (Elephantidae), which is included in the mammal order \u2018Proboscidea\u2019. The Asian elephant was formerly called the Indian elephant. The scientific name for Asian Elephant is Elephas maximus The Asian elephant has an large domed head with relatively small ears, an arched back and a single prehensile finger that is located at the tip of the trunk. An Asian elephant has 5 toes on the front of the feet and and 4 on the back. A large male Asian elephant can typically weigh 6 tons and measure 10 feet in height at the shoulder. The male Asian elephants have tusks and the females have \u2018tushes\u2019, which are short second incisors that just stick out beyond the upper lip.",

Their under lip is long, narrow and pointed. An Asian elephants skin is less wrinkled than the African elephants and only about 50% of Asian Elephant bulls have long tusks.Asian elephants have rather poor vision and are only capable of seeing clearly at very short distances up to about 10 metres. However, they have excellent hearing which is superior to human standards. Their large ears act as amplifiers and warn of possible dangers. Asian elephants have an excellent sense of smell which is thought to be superior to that of any other land mammal. They have excellent balance achieved by high tactile sense. The trunk, an incredibly versatile organ, contributes greatly to this ability.",
            "reproduction": "Male Asian elephants are quite solitary and only join the herd for mating seasons. Sometimes, male elephants will duel and the winner becomes the primary mating partner for the whole herd. The female Asian elephants run away for a short while, as part of a ritual, before mating with the victorious mate. The mating couple then remain together for around 3 weeks before the male heads off to the bachelor herd.The gestation period of the female Asian elephant is between 19 and 22 months. When she gives birth, the other herd females form a circle around the pregnant cow. She assumes a squatting position while giving birth and the birth takes around 2 hours. Just 2 hours after birth the calf can stand up and begins to suckle the mother.Baby elephants (calves) suckle their mother using the mouth and not their trunks. Baby elephants are weaned on milk for between 2 to 4 years. Although the calf will naturally be attracted to its mother, other females in the herd often take turns to look after the baby. If the mother dies then the other female elephants look after the orphaned calf.In regions where large carnivores, such as big cats, prey upon newly born elephants, the mother forms alliances with other herd members. Mother and associated protectors then blow dust over the new-born calf with their trunks in order to dry it.Female elephants can bear young at the age of 15 \u2013 16 years. They are fully grown at 20 years old. Elephants are in their working prime between 20 \u2013 40 years old. Female elephants start going bald around 30 years old and begin to slow down at around 40 years old and begin to do only light duties only when they reach 50 years old. Female Asian elephant live to be around 70 years old.",
            "sizes": "Elephants are the largest of all land creatures.A male elephant can stand 2.7metres (9 feet) in height.A male elephant can weigh between 3 \u2013 5 tonnes.Female elephants can stand 2.3 metres (7.5 feet) in height.Female elephants can weigh between 2.3 \u2013 4.5 tonnes.Newly born baby elephants (calves) stand at around (0.9 metres) 3 feet.Newly born baby elephants weigh 90 kilograms (200 pounds).",
            "trunks": "The elephants trunk is the most versatile of all animal organs. The trunk can be used for such diverse tasks as shifting a 600 kilograms log to picking up a blade of grass. It is a boneless mass of flesh and contains up to 100,000 muscles that are very flexible. It is usually 2 metres long and weighs around 140 kilograms.The trunk has a small finger like lip at the end which can distinguish between size, shape, texture, hot and cold. The animal uses its trunk to feed and drink by bringing food and water to the mouth. An elephant also uses its trunk to breathe, make noises, caress its young. When totally submerged in water the trunk can also be used as a snorkel. Trunks can hold six litres of water and are often used as a flexible shower hose pipe. It is a superb organ of smell, and can be directed easily towards where the smell is coming from.By beating the ground violently with the trunk the elephant signals its anger or displeasure. When an elephant is on unsteady or unfamiliar ground it will use the outside of the trunk to beat the earth, determining if the ground is firm enough to walk on. Once safety is confirmed, the front foot is moved forward onto the tested area. The rear foot follows and is carefully placed in exactly the same footprint."

            "desc": "The Asian Lion (Panthera leo persica) is a subspecies of the lion which survives today only in India and therefore it is also known as the Indian lion. Asian Lions once ranged from the Mediterranean to India, covering most of Southwest Asia where it was also known as the Persian Lion. The current wild population of Asian Lion consists of about 350 individuals restricted to the Gir Forest in the state of Gujarat, India, and is under the private protection of the ruler of the small state. The Asian lion habitats include tropical dry forests, tropical grasslands, deserts and semi-deserts. \u00a0",
            "characteristics": "Compared to their African cousins, Asian lions have shaggier coats, with a longer tassel on the end of the tail and longer tufts of hair on the elbows. The most noticeable physical characteristic found in all Asian lions, but rarely in African lions, is a longitudinal fold of skin running along their belly.The mane of the Asian lion is generally shorter than that of the African lion, so the ears are always visible. Asian lions are, in general, slightly smaller than African lions.Male Asian lions measure 1.7 \u2013 2.5 metres long and weigh 150 \u2013 250 kilograms, while female Asian lions measure 1.4 \u2013 1.75 metres in length and weigh in at 120 \u2013 182 kilograms. The Asian lions tail averages around 70 \u2013 105 centimetres long.Like all cats Asian lions are equipped with powerful retractable claws and long sharp canine teeth that are used in dragging their prey to the ground.\u00a0",
            "behaviour": "Like their African cousins, Asian lions are highly sociable animals living in social units called prides. The Asian lion pride is smaller. Studies have shown that most Gir prides contain just two adult females as compared to the average African pride which contains 4 to 6 adult females.The largest recorded female coalition of Asian lionesses is a group of five. However, it must be said that despite the small population and habitat area, few individual animals are known. The male Asian lions are less social and only associate with the pride when mating or on a large kill. It has been suggested that this may be because their prey animals are smaller than those in Africa, requiring fewer hunters to tackle them.Like African lions, hunting is a cooperative affair but adult males rarely participate. If vegetation is sparse, hunting usually takes place at night, but where it is thick, it may also take place during the day. The lions use stealth to approach their prey and then charge and either grab or knock it down before it outruns them. Only one in about four charges ends successfully. Lions are inactive for most of the day, spending up to 20 hours per day resting or sleeping.\u00a0",
            "reproduction": "Mating is not seasonal and takes place all year round. Male Asian lions reach sexual maturity at around 5 years old and female Asian lions reach sexual maturity earlier at around 4 years old. The gestation period last for between 100 \u2013 119 days after which 1 \u2013 6 cubs are born. Intervals between births can be 18 \u2013 26 months.The cubs start eating meat at about 3 months of age while continuing to suckle for up to 6 months. They spend 9 months perfecting their hunting skills, become independent aged one and reach maturity at 3 to 4 years. Cub mortality is high, up to 80% may die before 2 years of age. The life span of the Asian lion is 16 \u2013 18 years.\u00a0",
            "diet": "Like all wild cats, the Asian lion is a carnivore. The typical diet of the Asian lion is deer, antelope, wild boar and buffalo.\u00a0",
            "conservation status": "Asian lions are classed as critically endangered animal. Official protection by the imperial government was given in 1900, however, with increasing human population, overgrazing, and destruction of forest cover, suitable habitat was reduced to about 1,300 square kilometres. In 1957, three African lions, hardly different from their Asian relatives, were released in the Gir Forest sanctuary. Their increase has indicated that such an approach may ensure the continued existence of the lion in Asia. About 85 Asian lions survive in captivity."

It is recognised by its brightly colored rounded beak and its similar appearance to a penguin. Also known as the \u2018Common Puffin\u2019, it is the only puffin species which is found in the Atlantic Ocean. Very few people will have seen them in the wild. The reason for this lack of visibility is due to the fact that there are very few places in the UK where you can see puffins from the mainland due to their vulnerability from ground based mammals, especially rats. Puffins are not endangered and if you are able to hop on a boat sail towards their resident islands, you will be able to view them in their thousands. There is an estimated population of around 12 million Atlantic puffins around the world with Britain holding a good proportion of those numbers all around the UK coast.",
            "characteristics": "The Atlantic Puffin is 28 \u2013 34 centimetres in length, with a 50 \u2013 60 centimetre wingspan. The male puffin is slightly larger than the female puffin, however they are colored the same. The Atlantic Puffin is mainly black above and white below, with grey to white cheeks and red-orange legs.The Atlantic Puffins beak is large and triangular and during the breeding season is bright orange with a patch of blue bordered by yellow at the rear. The characteristic bright orange beak plates grow before the breeding season and are shed after breeding. When puffins are in flight they appear to have grey round underwings and a white body. Puffins have a direct flight, low over the water. The related Horned Puffin (Fratercula corniculata) from the North Pacific looks very similar, however, it has slightly different head features.",
            "diet": "Atlantic Puffins feed mostly on small fish such as herring and in particular sand-eel, which is one of the most important food sources for many of the worlds sea birds. Because of their specially adapted beak, puffins are able to go on long fishing trips, storing their previous catch in a neat row in their beak.Atlantic Puffins use their tongues to hold the fish against spines in their palate, leaving their beaks free to open and catch more fish. This makes each trip much more productive than it would be if they had to ferry prey back to the burrow each time. Additional components of their diet are crustaceans and mollusks. A puffin can sometimes have a dozen or more fish in its beak at once. Atlantic Puffins catch their prey by flying underwater, diving for around 20 \u2013 40 seconds at a time, using their wings to swim powerfully down and their webbed feet to point them in the right direction.",
            "behaviour": "Atlantic Puffins are colonial nesters, using burrows on grassy cliffs. Atlantic Puffins will also nest amongst rocks and scree (a term given to broken rock that appears at the bottom of crags, mountain cliffs or valley shoulders, forming a scree slope). Male puffins perform most of the work of clearing out the nest area, which is sometimes lined with grass, feathers or seaweed. The only time spent on land is to nest and mates are found prior to arriving at the colonies.The Atlantic Puffin is typically silent at sea, except for soft purring sounds it sometimes makes in flight. At the breeding colonies the birds make a deep growl. Atlantic Puffins use their beaks in courtship rituals, such as the male and female tapping their beaks together. A group of Puffins is called a gathering.",
            "reproduction": "The Atlantic Puffin is sexually mature at the age of 4 \u2013 5 years. Atlantic Puffins are monogamous (having only one mate) and have bi parental care. A single egg clutch is produced each year and incubation responsibilities are shared between both parents.Total incubation time is around 39 \u2013 45 days and the chick takes about 49 days to fledge. At fledging, the chick leaves the burrow alone and flies or swims out to sea, usually during the evening. Contrary to popular belief, young puffins are not abandoned by their parents.",
            "predators": "Predators of the Atlantic Puffin include the Great Black-backed Gull (Larus marinus) and similar-sized species, which can catch a puffin in flight, or pick off one separated from the colony. Smaller gull species like the Herring Gull (Larus argentatus) which cannot bring down a healthy adult puffin but will take eggs or recently hatched chicks and will also steal fish.",
            "conservation status": "The population of Atlantic Puffins was greatly reduced in the nineteenth century, when they were hunted for meat and eggs. Atlantic Puffins are still hunted and eaten in numbers, but at present this does not generally affect populations much, at least compared to other threats. On the Faroe Islands the birds may be hunted for local consumption after breeding is finished.The number of Atlantic Puffins increased considerably in the late twentieth century in the North Sea, including on the Isle of May and the Farne Islands. Numbers have been increasing by about 10% per year in recent years. In the 2006 breeding season, about 68,000 pairs were counted on the Isle of May."

They have a bushy tail and, like wolves and other wild dogs, dingoes have larger carnassials (large teeth found in many carnivorous mammals, used for shearing flesh and bone) and canine teeth.Dingoes have very agile wrists which are capable of rotation. This enables a dingo to use its paw like a hand and even to turn door handles. As well as agile wrists, a dingo is also capable of turning its head through almost 180 degrees in each direction. Dingoes ears are permanently erect and they have narrow, sloped eyes.",
            "dingo habitat": "Dingoes have a variety of habitats including deserts, alpine forests, coastal scrub, tropical wetlands, tropical rainforests and forested snow-clad peaks in Australia. Dens are made in rock caves, rabbit burrows and hollow logs usually close to a water source.",
            "dingo diet": "Dingoes are carnivores and have a very varied diet ranging from insects to water buffalo. They are opportunist feeders and will hunt anything including geese, wallabies, kangaroos, lizards, rabbits, mice and rats. They hunt alone when stalking small prey and in packs when targeting large prey. Dingoes will also scavenge carrion (dead animal carcasses) and eat fruit and plants.Since Asian populations live close to human settlements, much of their diet is composed of household refuse including cooked rice, fruits and other table scraps.",
            "dingo behaviour": "A group of Dingoes is called a \u2018pack\u2019. Some dingoes are solitary, however, most belong to packs which frequently gather to socialise or mate. During these gatherings, dingoes scent mark, howl and get into conflict with each other. Packs of dingoes can consist of 3 \u2013 12 individuals. Each pack contains a dominant male and female which is decided through aggressive stand-offs.Dingoes are territorial animals that choose their territories, not through pack size, but for the environment, for example, terrain texture and prey availability. Dingoes in the south of Australia tend to have larger ranges that those in the north.Dingoes are very vocal, however, they do not tend to bark like their dog cousins. Instead they frequently howl and have 3 basic howls over 10 variations. Dingoes howl to attract members of their pack and to warn off intruders. Dingoes are intelligent animals and very independent making them more difficult to train than domestic dogs, although they are still kept as pets by some.",
            "dingo reproduction": "Breeding is restricted to the dominant pair of a pack, however, other members will assist with the parental care of the pups. Female pack members help feed the young by regurgitating food and water for the pups. Males will scent mark more than females during the breeding season (which occurs March to April in Australia and in Autumn in Asia). Breeding season is once a year (like wolves but unlike domestic dogs).Dingoes reach sexual maturity at 2 years for females and 1 \u2013 3 years for males. Alpha females will enter in estrous once a year for 10 \u2013 12 days and is only receptive during this time. After a gestation period of 61 \u2013 69 days (around 2 months), a litter of between 1 \u2013 10 pups is born in maternal caves or burrows. Pups are weaned onto solid foods at 8 weeks and become independent at around 3 \u2013 6 months.Pups may remain with the pack for 12 months. The alpha female is known to kill the pups of other female members of the pack to ensure that the dominant animals will pass on their genes to the next generation. The life span of a dingo is between 5 and 10 years in the wild and up to 15 years or more in captivity.",
            "dingo conservation status": "The Dingo is classed as vulnerable by the IUCN. Trapping and poisoning is a major concern and also hybridisation with domestics dogs has reduced the numbers of pure bred dingoes."

            "desc": "Australia has a diversity of bird life and one of the most fascinating birds is the large water bird, the Australian Pelican (Pelecanus conspicillatus). The Australian Pelican is found across Australia and New Guinea on many inland and coastal waters but tends to avoid the very dry desert regions mainly located in the centre of the continent. These pelicans also occur in Indonesia and sometimes in New Zealand and some Pacific Islands close to Australia. The Australian Pelican is the largest of the 8 species of Pelicans found worldwide.",
            "characteristics": "Australian Pelicans are large shore birds who measure 1.6 \u2013 1.9 metres (5.3 \u2013 6.2 feet) in length and weigh 4 \u2013 6.8 kilograms with some larger birds weighing up to 8.2 kilograms.Australian pelicans have a very large wingspan of 2.5 \u2013 3.4 metres (8.2 \u2013 11.2 feet). Females are slightly smaller than males. Their plumage is white and their primary wing feathers are black and they have black markings on their tails.The face of the Australian pelican is white and on the back of the head and part way down their neck is a streak of grey. The eyes are brown and yellow. Their legs and feet are blue-grey in color and they have 4 webbed toes.Australian pelicans have huge, pouched bills that are pale pink in color. Their huge bill is the largest out of all birds in the world and measures 49 centimetres (19.5 inches) in length and can hold 9 \u2013 13 litres of water. The bill has a small hook at the tip and are serrated inside to hold on to slippery fish. The bill is delicately built. The lower jaw consists of 2 thin and weak articulated bones from which the pouch hangs.It may be hard to imagine such a bird as large as the pelican flying, but it can easily fly because it has an extremely lightweight skeleton which only weighs 10% of its total weight. Australian pelicans are very buoyant birds and do not sink under the water, however, pelicans do not have much waterproofing oil on the feathers and can therefore become wet and cold.\u00a0",
            "habitat": "Australian Pelicans prefer large open water sources such as freshwater and salt lakes, rivers, swamps, lagoons, coastlines and other wetland biomes that do not have too much aquatic vegetation.The water is the most important habitat to the pelicans and can be in a number of different surroundings such as grassland, forest, esturary mudflats as long as it have a plentiful supply of fish.\u00a0",
            "diet": "The Australian Pelicans main diet is fish. However, they have also been know to eat small turtles, tadpoles, shrimp and other crustaceans. Pelicans drink by opening their bill to collect rainwater.\u00a0",
            "behaviour": "Australian pelicans live in large flocks or colonies and will travel long distances in search of suitable water sources and breeding grounds.Australian pelicans work together in cooperative groups when hunting for fish, herding their prey to shallow water where they can scoop up their dinner in their huge bills. A pelican\u2019s bill and pouch play an important role in feeding. The bill is sensitive and this helps locate fish in cloudy muddy water.Pelican groups can be extremely large, with some numbering over 1,000 birds. The groups drive the fish to a central position and then plunge their huge bills into the water, trapping the fish in their pounches. The water is then drained as the pelican presses the bill against its chest so all that remains is the fish. The fish is then manoeuvred so that it can easily be swallowed whole down the pelicans throat with a quick jolt of the head. The pouch can also be used as a net to catch food thrown by humans.It is an amazing sight when pelicans take off for flight, skimming across the waters surface, flapping their enormous wings and lifting up into the air. Pelicans are not capable of sustained flapping flight but can soar remarkably at great heights and for very long distances, floating on the air thermals on which they depend. They can remain in the air for over 24 hours covering hundreds of kilometres. By moving from one thermal to the next, pelicans can travel long distances with very minimum effort, reaching air speeds of up to 56 kilometres per hour.When landing, they descend from the sky towards the watery runway, gliding and coming to a halt with the help of its huge wings spread widely to act as brakes. It has been known for the Australian Pelican to soar at heights of up to 3,000 metres (3 kilometres).Like many wading birds, pelicans are known to form \u2018V\u2019 formation when flying in large flocks.The Australian pelicans vocalisation is a chesty rumbling or deep growling.\u00a0",
            "courtship displays and reproduction": "The Australian pelican breeding season varies depending on season. It occurs in late Spring in southern Australia and in tropical regions during the Winter. Environmental conditions are important for breeding, particularly rainfall.Pelicans are colonial breeders and gather in very large groups, some containing up to 40,000 individuals nesting on islands or secluded sandy shores.Male pelicans perform courting rituals such as complex dancing in order to attract females. The males may also pick up small objects, like sticks or dry fish, which they toss in the air and catch again, repeating the display several times. Both male and female perform \u2018pouch-rippling\u2019 which involves clapping their bills shut several times a second and causing the pouches to ripple like a flag in a strong breeze.The pelican\u2019s bill and pouch change color dramatically during courtship. The front half of the pouch becomes bright salmon pink, while the skin of the pouch in the throat area changes to metallic yellow. Parts of the top and base of the bill change to cobalt blue, and a black diagonal strip appears from the base to the tip. The color change does not last long and usually subsides by the time incubation begins.As the courtship array progresses, the males withdraw one by one. Finally, after pursuits on land, water or in the air, only a single male is left. The successful male is led to the nesting site by the female. Nests are shallow depressions or scrapes sometimes lined with grass, twigs and feathers.The female pelican lays 1 \u2013 3 chalky-white eggs which measure 93 x 57 millimetres and become soiled and scratched as incubation is performed on the parents feet. Both male and female take turns to incubate the eggs. After 32 \u2013 37 days, the eggs hatch and the pelican chicks are born naked and blind. The first hatchling is always larger and is fed the most food by the parents. The smaller hatchling may starve and die because of this or even may be attacked by its larger sibling.Pelican chicks are fed regurgitated liquid for the first 2 weeks obtained by thrusting their bills down the parent\u2019s gullet and then for the next 2 months, they are fed small fish such as Goldfish or Carp and invertebrates. The young leave the nest after 28 days and join creches of up to 100 juveniles where they are cared for until they have learned to feed, fly and become independent.The Australian Pelican matures and is able to breed at the age of 2 \u2013 3 years. Their life span in the wild is between 10 and 25 years.\u00a0",
            "conservation status": "The Australian Pelican is classed as \u2018Least Concern\u2019 by the IUCN. One of the pelicans main problems is man and his fishing hooks which can tear the pelican\u2019s pouch. Fishing lines are also a problem as the birds can become entangled in abandoned lines."

They have a forked tail and narrow wings for fast flight. Their beak is small and they have a wide gape surrounded by bristles adapted for catching insects in flight.Swiftlets have short legs which prevent the birds from perching, however, it allows them to cling to vertical surfaces. They have four toes on each feet. Swiftlets have small breast muscles and very long primary flight feathers adapted for their main flying technique which is gliding.",
            "habitat": "The Australian Swiftlet can be found around tropical coastal areas and offshore islands occurring 1,000 metres above sea level but more commonly below 500 metres. It tends to forage in flocks over the edge of the Rainforests, beaches and gorges and sometimes pastures and savannas.",
            "diet": "The Australian Swiftlet is an insectivore and a flight feeder who preys on insects and floating spiders. It typically feeds during the day and within 30 kilometres of the breeding colony, returning to the caves at night to roost.",
            "behaviour": "The Australian Swiflet has a high pitched call when in flight. During breeding season, it can be heard uttering a metallic clicking call.Australian Swiflets have the ability to use a simple but effective form of echolocation to navigate in total darkness through the chasms and shafts of the caves where they roost at night and breed during the breeding season.These birds also emit a series of low clicks followed by a call when approaching the nests, probably to warn nearby birds out of their way.\u00a0",
            "reproduction": "The Australian Swiftlet\u2019s breeding season occurs from October to March. These small coastal birds nest in colonies which contain hundreds of individuals in coastal caves or around boulders and rocks.Australian Swiftlets are monogamous, which means they pair for life. Males perform aerial displays to attract females and mating occurs at the nest. Nests are usually constructed inside caves and are attached to the cave walls or ceilings and can be up to 20 metres off the ground. The nests are generally basket-shaped and semitransparent and made from a grasses, twigs, casuarina needles and feathers mixed together with the bird\u2019s saliva.The female lays two clutches each containing one single dull, white egg. The first egg is incubated by both parents for around 26 \u2013 27 days. The second egg is also incubated and is aided by the warmth of the first hatched chick.The parents leave the nest for periods of 30 minutes at a time to hunt for food for themselves and the chicks.

There are approximately 300,000 badgers in the United Kingdom. This may seem like a large number, however, an estimated 47,500 are killed in road accidents every year. The badger is an endangered species in many parts of the UK. Badgers measure around 75 centimetres in length and have a tail length of around 15 centimetres. Their average weight is 8 \u2013 9 kilograms in Spring and 11 \u2013 12 kilograms in Autumn, however, weights can vary enormously.

Badgers are thick set, round backed mammals that are very powerful for their size.Badgers have course, grey body fur and black colored short, but powerful legs and their paws are adapted with long, sharp claws that are very useful for digging. It is generally believed that badgers have poor eyesight, however, their hearing and sense of smell are excellent. Badgers have a distinctive black and white striped face and white-tipped ears.Another major feature of the badger is their scent glands. Badgers have the ability to produce a very unpleasant smell through their anal glands when being threatened or giving a warning. These excretions are also used in communication, to mark out territories and to guide badgers around their boundaries by spraying pathways and landmarks. The Badger also possesses a gland under the base of its tail, which gives of a slightly better musky scent that can be used in communication and scent marking each other.",
            "habitats": "Badgers rarely venture out during the day and live in an extensive network of underground tunnels and nests, known as a \u2018sett\u2019. Badgers prefer a well drained soil and often dig their setts under matted tree roots to provide stability to the soil. Nest chambers in the tunnels are lined with dry grass, bracken and straw. Bedding may be taken to the entrance of the sett in order to air in the sun. When emerging at nightfall, they go in search of food, usually venturing into a nearby field or woodland. Badgers emerge at dusk in summer to spend the night foraging. In winter, Badgers are much less active, however, they do not hibernate.",
            "diet": "Badgers are mainly carnivores but also referred to as omnivorous and insectivorous and a tasty earthworm or juicy bulb will satisfy their hunger along with small mammals, lizards, frogs, insects or young rabbits and birds. Earthworms make up 50% of their diet. Depending on the time of year badgers also feed upon berries, fruits, nuts, roots and cereals if other food sources are short. Badgers are also known to eat carrion (the carcass of a dead animal). They also dig up the nests of wasps and bumblebees in order to eat the larvae.In urban areas, some badgers scavenge food from bins and gardens.",
            "behaviour": "In areas of the UK and Europe where food supplies are plentiful, badgers are social creatures, living within groups of between 4 and 12 individuals often called \u2018clans\u2019. There is usually one dominant male (a boar) and female (a sow). The territory of a badger is usually bordered by latrines and dung pits. As with many wild animals if other groups cross these borders, fierce fights can occur. In other parts of Europe, where food is more scarce, Badgers tend to adopt a more solitary existence and are not required to mark out a territory.",
            "reproduction": "Mating occurs during the summer, however, implantation is delayed until December which means they can hold fertilised eggs in suspended development until the right time for breeding occurs. The gestation period is 7 \u2013 8 weeks. One litter of 2 \u2013 5 cubs is born from January to March.Adult badgers protect, discipline and groom their young. They are very house proud and do not intentionally interfere or disturb anyone.Badgers live for up to 15 years (average 3 years) in the wild and up to 19 years in captivity. If they survive their first year, the most common cause of death is by road traffic.",
            "conservation status": "Badger population is estimated to be 250,000 \u2013 300,000 adults living in 50,000 groups. Around 50,000 badgers are killed each year on the roads. Ten thousand badgers are still killed each year by illegal baiting.Badgers in Britain have in past times been threatened by badger-baiting, a sport in which the badger was attacked by a succession of dogs until it was no longer able to fight and resulted in death. This activity was common throughout middle age Great Britain until an Act of Parliament banned it in 1835. Badger digging was also made illegal in 1973 under the Badger Act. The only thing to threaten the badger population nowadays is any disease within the species, loss of habitat through agriculture and development or road traffic accidents. However, they are well protected by law, the most recent being The Protection of Badgers Act in 1992, and there are many local groups around the country that actively promote and protect this popular charming creature."

Bees have antennae almost universally made up of thirteen segments in males and twelve in females. They all have two pairs of wings, the back pair being the smaller of the two. In very few species, one sex or caste has relatively short wings that make it difficult or impossible to fly.Many species of bees are poorly known. The smallest bee is a dwarf bee (Trigona minima) and it is about 2.1 millimetres long. The largest bee in the world is Megachile pluto (an Indonesian leafcutter bee that uses resin to make compartments in its nest), which can grow to be as large as 39 millimetres. The most common type of bee in North America is the \u2018Halictidae\u2019, or \u2018sweat bee\u2019, though this may come as a surprise to natives, as they are so small and often mistaken for wasps.The most common species of bee is the Western honey bee, which produces honey, as do a few other types of bee. Human management of this species is known as beekeeping or apiculture (the practice of intentional maintenance of honey bee colonies, commonly in hives).",
            "bee pollination": "Bees play an important role in pollinating flowering plants, they may focus on gathering nectar or on gathering pollen, depending on their greater need at the time. Bees gathering nectar may accomplish pollination, but bees that are deliberately gathering pollen are more efficient pollinators.Bees periodically stop foraging and groom themselves to pack the pollen into the scopa (pollen carrying apparatus), which is located on the legs in most bees and on the ventral abdomen on others.Pollen and nectar are usually combined together to form a \u2018provision mass\u2019, which is often soupy, but can be firm and formed into various shapes. It is stored in a small chamber (a cell), with the egg deposited on the mass. The cell is typically sealed after the egg is laid and the adult and larva never interact directly (a system called \u2018mass provisioning\u2019).The earliest animal-pollinated flowers were pollinated by insects such as beetles, so the syndrome of insect pollination was well established before bees first appeared. The advantage is that bees are specialized as pollinating insects, with behavioural and physical modifications that specifically enhance pollination and they are much more efficient at the task than beetles, flies, butterflies, pollen wasps, or any other pollinating insect.",
            "bee history": "Bees, like ants, are essentially a highly specialized form of wasp. While the first definite fossil bees date from only forty million years ago, there is genetic and partial fossil evidence that they evolved alongside flowers, at least 140 million years ago.",
            "bee predators": "Bees are the favourite meal of \u2018Merops apiaster\u2019, a bird actually called a \u2018Bee-Eater\u2019. Bee-Eaters are mainly found in Africa and can be recognised by their bright colored plumage, slender bodies and usually elongated central tail feathers. (see photo left). Before eating its meal, a bee-eater removes the sting by repeatedly hitting the insect on a hard surface. Other common predators of bees are kingbirds, mockingbirds and dragonflies.Visiting flowers can be a dangerous occupation. Many assassin bugs and crab spiders hide in flowers to capture unwary bees. Other bees are lost to birds in flight (see above). Insecticides used on blooming plants can kill large numbers of bees, both by direct poisoning and by contamination of their food supply.A honey bee queen may lay 2000 eggs per day during spring buildup, but she also must lay 1000 to 1500 eggs per day during the foraging season, mostly to replace daily casualties. Most casualties are workers simply dying of old age rather than being caught by predators.Among solitary and primitively social bees, however, lifetime reproduction is among the lowest of all insects, as it is not uncommon for females of such species to produce fewer than 25 offspring.",
            "": "Despite their painful sting and the typical attitude of insects as annoying or disgusting pests, humans hold bees in high regard. This is most likely due to their usefulness towards man, their social nature, as well as their diligence. Although a bee sting can be deadly to some, bees are generally regarded as non-agressive insects if left alone. The phrase \u2018busy as a bee\u2019 reflects their gentle, hard-working nature.Social BeesAmerican BumblebeeEuropean Dark BeeWestern BumblebeeWestern HoneybeeItalian BeeBrown-Belted BumblebeeCommon Eastern BumblebeeCape HoneybeeRussian HoneybeeKiller BeeGolden Northern BumblebeeBuckfast BeeSolitary BeesViolet Carpenter BeeEastern Carpenter BeeTawny Mining BeeRed Mason BeeMignonette Yellow-Face BeeBanksia BeeWallace\u2019s Giant BeeValley Carpenter BeeGolden-Green Carpenter BeeSmall Scabious Mining BeeOrchard Mason BeeEuropean Wool Carder BeePigmented Miner Bee"

            "desc": "There are probably more species of beetle on this earth than there are species of plants. Beetles have the ability to adapt to any kind of environment which guarantees an extremely long existence. They appear in every corner of the world, in every kind of habitat but are not known to occur in the sea or in the polar regions. Beetles belong to the order \u2018Coleoptera\u2019, pronounced \u2018co-le-op-ter-a\u2019. This is the largest order of species in the animal kingdom, even larger than ants! Coleoptera come in all different shapes, sizes and colors. There are about 350,000 named species of beetle in the world and many more species that remain unnamed and undiscovered. Forty percent of all described insect species are beetles and new species are frequently being discovered. Estimates put the total number of species, described and undescribed, at between 5 and 8 million. The body of a Coleoptera is similar to that of other insects and consists of three main parts: Head, Thorax and Abdomen (see Beetle Anatomy).",
            "(coleoptera) diet": "Beetles interact with their ecosystems in several ways. They often feed on plants and fungi, break down animal and plant debris and eat other invertebrates. Some species are prey of various animals including birds and mammals.",
            "elytra": "One of the most important features of Coleoptera is their \u2018elytra\u2019, the hard exoskeletal which covers their wings. The \u2018elytra\u2019 helps to protect the beetle but also has many other functions too. Some beetles trap moisture in their wings and the elytra protects it from drying in heat and wind, this means the beetles can travel across arid deserts without dehydrating.Other Coleoptera can live under water because they can store air in their wings, which is again protected by the elytra. Coleoptera (beetles) are most probably the most versatile creatures on earth. The beetles exoskeleton is made up of numerous plates called sclerites (a hardened body part), separated by thin sutures. This design creates the armoured defenses of the beetle while maintaining flexibility.The elytra are not used for flight, but tend to cover the hind part of the body and protect the second pair of wings. The elytra must be raised in order to move the hind flight wings. A beetles flight wings are crossed with veins and are folded after landing, often along these veins, and are stored below the elytra.The photograph below shows the Elytra lifted to expose the hind wings beneath. \u00a0The Elytra is a hard covering which protects the delicate wings underneath it.In some beetles, the ability to fly has been lost. These include the ground beetles (family Carabidae) and some \u2018true weevils\u2018 (family Curculionidae), but also some desert and cave-dwelling species of other families. Many of these species have the two elytra fused together, forming a solid shield over the abdomen. In a few beetle families, both the ability to fly and the elytra have been lost, with the best known example being the glow-worms of the family Phengodidae, in which the females are larviform (where the females in the adult stage of metamorphosis resemble the larvae to various degrees) throughout their lives.",
            "get its name?": "The name \u2018Coleoptera\u2019 was first used by Aristotle in the fourth century B.C., more than 5,000 years ago! It comes from the Greek words \u2018koleos\u2019 which means sheath (or shield), and \u2018ptera\u2019 which means wings.The name refers to the beetles hardened front wings, the \u2018elytra\u2019, which covers the folded hind wings like a sheath. Insects in the order \u2018Coleoptera\u2019 are commonly called \u2018beetles\u2019. The common name \u2018beetle\u2019 comes from older English words for a \u2018little biter\u2019.Larvae of some species of Coleoptera are called grubs, wireworms and rootworms.",
            "habitats)": "Beetles do not really mind where they live \u2013 they can live just about anywhere. Beetles can be found in almost all habitats, but are not known to occur in the sea or in the polar regions such as the Arctic and Antarctic. They interact with their ecosystems in several ways.They often feed on plants and fungi, break down animal and plant debris and eat other invertebrates (any animal without a spinal column). Some species prey on various animals including birds and mammals.Certain species are agricultural pests, such as the Colorado potato beetle, the boll weevil, the red flour beetle and the mungbean or cowpea beetle, while other species of beetles are important controls of agricultural pests. For example, ladybirds consume aphids, scale insects (parasites of plants), thrips (insect species that feed on a large variety of plants and animals by puncturing them and sucking up the contents) and other plant-sucking insects that damage crops.Beetles can be found in many land and freshwater habitats.They live in:logs, under bark, in caves, in fungi, in mud, in decaying plant and animal matter, in water, in stored food, in bird and mammal nests and in termite nests.Some species even live in ant nests and feed of the larvae.\u00a0Beetles can also be found anywhere particularly where food is especially dried foods like grains, nuts, cereals and flour in such places as warehouses, bakeries and and grain stores.Here is a beetle trying to make his home in a mushroom!"

The Bengal tiger is primarily found in Bangladesh, India and also in Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar and in southern Tibet. The Bengal tiger inhabits in grasslands, subtropical and tropical rainforests (mostly Asian rainforests), scrub forests, wet and dry deciduous forests and mangroves.",
            "bengal tiger characteristics": "An average male Bengal tigers weigh around 420 pounds. The Bengal tiger has a body length of 6 feet and a tail length of 3 feet and therefore has a total length of 9 feet long. A female Bengal tiger is only 310 pounds and 8 feet long including tail.Bengal tigers are incredibly strong and are able to drag their prey almost half a mile even though the prey may be heavier than itself.A tigers coat can actually take on a variety of colors. The standard colors of a Bengal tiger are an orange body with black stripes coming down the sides. The two most common variations are the White Bengal tiger and the Golden Tabby.The White Bengal tiger is white with either brown or black stripes coming down the sides. The Golden Tabby is a whitish yellow color, with amber stripes coming down the sides. Tigers have large fangs for killing and maiming prey.Bengal tigers have the longest canine teeth of any living felid measuring approximately 4 inches (100 millimetres) in large individuals. A canine tooth of a tiger is larger and longer than that of a similar-sized lion.Bengal tigers also have large, retractable claws that allow them to climb and kill prey. Their stripes help them camouflage as they stalk their prey. Bengal tigers have excellent vision and good hearing.The heaviest Bengal Tiger ever reported was 389.5 kilograms. Female Bengal tigers are considerably smaller and have an average weight of 141 kilograms (310 pounds), but they can weigh up to 180 kilograms (400 pounds).\u00a0",
            "bengal tiger behaviour": "Bengal tigers are mostly solitary, however, they sometimes travel in groups of 3 or 4 individuals. Bengal tigers reside in the low-land parts of the rainforest where there are grasslands and swamps.Some male Bengal tigers occupy 200 square miles of territory and they protect it very fiercely. Bengal tigers are extremely strong animals and can drag their killed prey some 1,500 feet to hide it in bushes or long grass until it feeds upon it. The Bengal tiger is a nocturnal animal, it sleeps throughout the day and hunts at night.Despite their size, Bengal tigers can climb trees effectively, however, they are not as agile as the smaller leopard, which hides its kills from other predators in the trees. Bengal tigers are also strong and frequent swimmers, often ambushing drinking or swimming prey or chasing prey that has retreated into water.Bengal tigers also like to play and often engage in play-fighting.",
            "": "",
            "bengal tiger diet": "Bengal tigers are carnivores which means they eat meat rather than plants. Bengal tigers hunt medium-sized and large-sized animals, such as wild boar (an omnivorous mammal), sambar (a kind of deer), barasingha (a kind of deer), chital (a spotted deer), nilgai (an antelope), gaur (a large ox of South Asia) and water buffalo.Bengal tigers sometimes prey on smaller animals like hares, monkeys or peacocks and carrion (the carcass of a dead animal). Bengal tigers have also been known to prey on young Asian Elephants and rhino calves in rare cases.Bengal tigers have also been known to take other predators such as leopards, wolves, jackals, foxes, crocodiles and dholes (a species of wild dog) as prey, although these predators are not typically a part of the Bengal tigers diet.Bengal tigers kill their prey by overpowering their victim and severing the spinal cord (preferred method for smaller prey), or applying a suffocation bite of the throat for large prey. The Bengal tiger can consume up to about 30 kilograms (66 pounds) of meat at a time and then can survive up to three weeks without food.\u00a0",
            "bengal tiger life span": "The Bengal tiger can live to about 18 years in captivity and probably a few years less in the wild.\u00a0",
            "bengal tiger reproduction": "A female Bengal tiger usually has her first cubs at about 3 or 4 years old. Gestation for a female tiger usually lasts about 3 or 4 months. After this time she gives birth to an average litter of about 2 to 5 cubs. It is not unusual though to have as many as 6, or only one. Newborn cubs are blind at birth and weigh about 2 or 3 pounds.Tiger cubs are playful at birth and retain a curious nature throughout life. From the time of birth until one year, tiger cubs are also completely dependant of their mother for nutrition. At the age of one year, they are able to kill smaller prey, but are still very vulnerable to larger predators, such as hyenas and lions.At the age of 2 years, the cubs become fully independent. Male cubs leave their birthplace and start off to find territory of their own. Female cubs generally stay in the same area as their mother.A cub has more stripes than an adult tiger. This helps the cubs camouflage or else they might end up as another animals dinner.\u00a0",
            "bengal tiger conservation status": "Bengal tigers are an \u2018endangered species\u2019. The current population of wild Bengal tigers in the Indian subcontinent is now estimated to be around 1300 \u2013 1500. which is less than half of the previous estimation of 3000 \u2013 4500 tigers. Bengal tigers are in danger of extinction due to over-hunting by poachers.Habitat loss and poaching are important threats to species survival. Poachers kill tigers not only for their pelts (coats), but also for components to make various traditional East Asian medicines.Other factors contributing to their loss are urbanization and revenge killing. Revenge killing occurs as locals such as farmers who own livestock hunt down the tigers to prevent them from preying on their cattle. Poachers also kill tigers for their bones and teeth to make medicines that are alleged to provide the tigers strength."

            "desc": "Betta Fish are found mainly in the southern parts of South-East Asia, and are in abundance in Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia. It thrives in the wild especially in reedy ponds, slow moving creeks and rivers. It also can be found in shallow waters such as stagnant ponds, rice paddies and many times in highway drains and low level catchment areas. Considered to be the most beautiful of all tropical fish, Betta Fish get their name because of their aggressiveness towards other males. They\u2019re also aggressive in nature because they have to survive in small bodies of water, and therefore tend to fiercely protect their area (where they live) or they\u2019ll lose out on breeding with a female to a more dominant male. People have been breeding Betta Fish for thousands of years in Vietnam. In places like Thailand for example\u2026 they even breed these fish to fight to their death. However, it\u2019s the Betta Fish which are bred as ornamental types that are usually MUCH prettier than the ones bred for fighting. It\u2019s illegal to breed Betta Fish for fighting in most parts of the world. But in areas of asia people still place bets on fights between two aggressive males.",
            "characteristics of betta fish": "In their natural environment Betta Fish are generally brownish or even silver in color with highlights of red or even bright green stripes and patches. These types are not considered nearly as pretty as the ones that are bred with much smaller fins. Pet shops usually carry the ornamental types which are more striking in color and appearance. This is especially so when compared to Betta Fish which are bred for fighting. They say that it\u2019s the color in their hues and their flowing fins why they\u2019re known as Betta splendens or the \u201csplendid betta fish\u201d.Betta Fish need regular care. They have a truly unique feature which sets them apart from a lot of other types of tiny fish. These fish can breathe both through their gills and through a special organ called the \u201clabyrinthine\u201d allowing them to absorb pure oxygen when there\u2019s a limited supply of oxygen in its water environment.The Beautiful Colors Of Betta FishThese pretty ornamental fish come in about every color you could imagine. Sometimes in solid colors, half-colors know as \u201cbutterfly\u201d, and colors like marble and piebald. In the animal kingdom males are usually more colorful than females. It\u2019s NO different when it comes to Betta Fish. The male is more colorful, and with larger flowing fins. The colors on the males help them display strength against other rival males. A male Betta Fish is somewhat different in the shape of their tails than females. Generally rounder in appearance than females. Males have single tails, double tails, fringed tails and even veil tails.Betta Fish are oftentimes bright iridescent all over. But depending on the area the male can also be only partially iridescent or even a dull matte color.Oftentimes the brighter white Betta Fish that once was thought to be a totally different type of fish was called \u201cBetta cambodia\u201d. However, later it was classed as only a color variation in its type. Today you can still hear Betta Fish referred to as Cambodia. But it\u2019s mainly used in conjunction with fish with bright white bodies and pigmented colored fins and eyes.Betta Fish Need Adequate SpaceBetta Fish can pick-up a number of common diseases like dropsy and fin rot. In most cases it\u2019s more or less associated with the quality of their water environment. In a domestic tank environment there\u2019s special medicines available such as \u201cBettafix\u201d which is great for aquarium fish like Betta Fish. Betta Fish will live in small bowls and tanks but it\u2019s not advised. Betta Fish kept in small glass jars and modern plastic containers have much less of a survival chance than a fish living in at least 3 to 5 gallons of water. It\u2019s always best though to keep Betta Fish in separate containers unless you are thinking about breeding. Another thing to watch out for is trying to put different varieties of tropical fish in a single bowl or tank. Why? Because long finned, reddish colored tropical fish almost always will pick-on Betta Fish. Tropical fish such as\u2026 \u201ctiger barbs, serpae, and even tetras\u201d tend to attack their long flowing fin.Betta Fish Are CarnivorousAs a carnivorous fish they should be fed commercial fish food, special \u201cBetta Pellets\u201d or frozen tubifex worms. Fresh bloodworms and mosquito wrigglers also make a tasty treat for them. As water temperature drops, their metabolism slows down and you need to feed them less often. However, during the warmer summer months you should feed them a small amount of food on a daily basis.What Is The Life Expectancy Of Betta Fish?In their natural environment Betta Fish will survive perhaps only a year or two at the very most. However, when they\u2019re bred in captivity (and are properly looked after) you can expect a pet Betta Fish to live anywhere up to 2 to 4 years of age. As a general rule of thumb: the prettier the specimen is, usually the much shorter lifespan it has. Another thing to remember is that female Betta Fish are more prone to disease than the male. So, females live a much shorter life especially when their not looked after well. Expect to pay anywhere from $3.00 to upwards of $25.00 for the most beautiful and spectacularly iridescent of specimens.When it comes to buying glass bowl or tank expect to pay anywhere from $25 to $150. Betta Fish are freshwater tropical fish that thrive in shallow waters, and in warmer temperatures around the 30 degrees mark. Nevertheless, if you live in a more temperate climate, then you\u2019ll need to add a quality aquarium heater to your tank. Especially if the water temperature tends to fall below the 18 degrees mark. Betta Fish can survive in poorer quality water conditions but to enjoy a happy, healthy and lively pet fish you should change its water frequently. These gorgeous long fin beauties really do need their water changed at least \u201cone to three\u201d times a week.If you put your pet Betta Fish in a small bowl you will need to change the water every few days. Anyone can own a Betta Fish. They\u2019re an especially good pet to have as a first-time pet owner or somebody that has very little time or space in their lives for a regular size pet say like a cat or dog.Betta Fish Anatomy"

It is one of the three currently recognized species belonging to the genus Sepioteuthis. They are generally found in Indo-West Pacific waters and are characterised by a large oval fin that extends along their mantle, giving them a similar appearance to cuttlefish. Bigfin reef squids have the fastest recorded growth rates of any large marine invertebrate, reaching 600 g (1.3 lb) in only four months, but have a very short lifespan of less than a year. They feed mainly on crustaceans and small fish. These squid are fished extensively for human consumption in Asia. However, they are not found on any threatened or endangered species list. Their robust population and wide distribution makes it unlikely that it will become a threatened species in the near future.",
            "lifespan": "Bigfin reef squid typically complete their entire life cycle within 4 to 6 months of birth, and therefore have a lifespan of around 315 days. The temperature of the water they reside in my affect rates of growth and sexual maturation in squid. The warmer the water, the shorter the lifespan of these squid.",
            "diet": "The bigfin reef squid are carnivores and mainly eat mollusks and fish, but also consume non-insect arthropods, zooplankton, and other marine invertebrates. Captive bigfin reef squid were observed to consume one fish every 2 to 25 hours.They use their specialized tentacles to capture live prey and then use their specialized beak to tear and crush the prey.",
            "behavior": "Bigfin reef squid are active at night, and will move to deeper waters or find cover in daytime.Newly hatched young will swim in shoals and can interact with one another to increase chances of survival, by warning each other of predators and helping one another find food sources. However, as the squid get older, they tend to become more solitary.However, during the mating season, mature squid once again form shoals and participate in a number of social interactions, including displays of dominance, courting, territorial behavior, and signaling the presence of predators.Bigfin reef squid communicate with one another by using rapid, vivid changes in its body color pattern to convey information about potential threats, food sources, or dominance. They also communicate through chasing or biting of other individuals. They do not possess any specialized organs for sound detection or production (although vibrations are perceived), instead relying upon their highly developed sense of sight for communication and perception of their environment.",
            "reproduction": "Bigfin reef squid breed in shoals during the day and separates at night to feed. During mating, male and female bigfin reef squid form close pairs that can last up to several days. Prior to mating, male bigfin reef squid can become aggressive and they will battle other males using certain body patterns and postures to determine who will breed with the mature females.Elaborate breeding behaviors are known in this species, which largely involve the display of complex body patterns during courtship. Male oval squid use a \u201cStripe\u201d pattern and a \u201cFlicker\u201d display, while females show a display known as the sexual \u201cSaddle\u201d.Mating can occur in two different ways: \u201chead-to-head\u201d or \u201cmale-parallel\u201d mating. In \u201chead-to-head\u201d mating, the male swims upside down and lunges forward towards the female, having already ejected several spermatophores from his funnel onto his hectocotyli, which he attempts to deposit into the female\u2019s mouth funnel. The female will then transfer the spermatophores to her oviduct for fertilization.\u201cMale-parallel\u201d mating involves the male and female swimming side by side. The male then moves below the female, clasps her neck with his arms, and inserts his hectocotylus into the mantle cavity of the female, attaching the spermatophores at the opening of the oviduct.Once copulation has ended, females release 20 to 1180 eggs per individual, in egg capsules that contain up to 13 eggs each. They can lay eggs year round and the onset of the major spawning season can vary by location. In warmer waters, such as around India, spawning can occur as early as January while in cooler waters near Japan, spawning can begin as late as September.The egg capsules are laid in single straight strands on rocks, corals, plants, submerged branches, and other surfaces along shore lines. The eggs are 3 mm (0.12 in) in diameter and the egg capsules about 58.2 mm (2.29 in) in length and 12.6 mm (0.50 in) in width, on average. Females coat the eggs in a gelatinous substance, forming an egg capsule that offers protection and nourishment while the egg develops. Paired males often remain with the females for protection while the eggs are being laid, but this is only temporary.Once the female lays eggs, her body deteriorates and she usually dies before she can mate again. However, males can usually mate with several more females before he dies.The eggs have a gestation period of between 15 and 22 days, depending on the temperature. Once hacthed, the baby bigfin reef squid are about 4.5 to 6.5 mm in mantle length (excluding tentacles), with fully functioning fins and ink sacs. There is no parental care, but they are already strong swimmers.Bigfin reef squid have one of the fastest recorded growth rates for any large marine invertebrate. They can reach 600 g (1.3 lb) in only four months.Bigfin reef squid reach sexual maturity at less than 210 days in the wild. Males reach sexual maturity earlier than females. Males have been observed to exhibit mating behaviours with other males. Some males have been found with numerous spermatophores embedded in their mouth funnels.Bigfin Reef Squid Location and HabitatThe bigfin reef squid is the most widespread species in the genus Sepioteuthis. It is found in temperate and tropical regions of the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean, between northern Australia, New Zealand and Asia. They also occur as far north as the Mediterranean Sea and in eastern portions of the Pacific Ocean near the Hawaiian Islands.They like warm (typically 16\u00b0C to 34\u00b0C) coastal waters and at night, when they are most active, bigfin reef squid are usually found 0 to 100 m (0 to 328 ft) below the water\u2019s surface. They tend to remain close to the shoreline, near rocks and reefs. During the day, they generally move to deeper waters or near any form of cover, such as floating driftwood, reefs, rocks, or grasses.\u00a0Bigfin Reef Squid Conservation StatusBigfin reef squid have a large distribution and population. They are not considered to be endangered, and are very important for both commercial and ecosystem reasons. They adapt to warmer temperatures by laying more eggs, making them a good indicator species for climate change. This may mean that, as the temperature of the sea rises with climate change, the population of the bigfin reef squid will increase.These squid are widely consumed as human food and are usually caught in large numbers by trawling, seine fishing, or fixed net traps. Since they are not a seasonal species, they can be fished throughout the year.They are used not only for food, but also as bait for many other species. Since bigfin reef squid have a rapid growth rate, short life span, low rates of disease, low rates of cannibalism, and tolerance to handling and captivity, they are commonly observed and raised in labs. For these reasons, they are also thought to be one of the most promising species for mariculture.",
            "predators": "The main predators of bigfin reef squid are tuna, marlin, swordfish, blue-fin, sharks and whales. They are most vulnerable to predation during larval stages. Squid hatchlings are often cannibalistic, which is one of the main sources of predation on young squid.Bigfin reef squid rely on camouflage to hide from predators and change their coloration based on their surroundings using their chromatophores.

Little is known about the big fin squid as no adult specimens have ever been captured or sampled. Nonetheless, these animals are notable for their arms and tentacles that are extremely long and thought to be 4 to 8 m (13 to 26 ft) in length. Currently, scientists have officially described three species of these giant squid, but there may be more. Only more sightings of these unique animals will help us to understand them more. \u00a0",

It is thought by scientists that they feed by dragging their arms and tentacles along the seafloor and grabbing edible organisms from the floor. They may also use a trapping technique, and trap zooplankton as and when it swims past or bumps into their arms.\u00a0Bigfin Squid Location and HabitatBigfin squid are widely distributed throughout the world\u2019s deep ocean, and they can live deeper than any other known squid. They live at extreme depths of nearly 4,800 meters in the deep sea.They have been spotted off the coast of Ghana, Senegal, south of Mauritius, the Gulf of Mexico, Hawaii, in the area of Rodrigues Island, the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and even around Australia.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

There are two kinds of Bison species (also known as Buffalo) that inhabit our planet, they are the American Bison (Bison bison) which include the species American plains bison (Bison bison bison) and the American wood bison (Bison bison athabascae), and the European Bison (Bison bonasus) which are also referred to as \u2018Wisent\u2019. Altogether, there were originally 6 species of Bison, however, 4 are now extinct. Male Bison are referred to as \u2018Bulls\u2019 and females are referred to as \u2018Cows\u2019. American Bison and European Bison are very similar in appearance. Bison are huge, powerful, aggressive bovine mammals with solid muscular heads and necks which are covered with brown shaggy fur. They use their very strong heads to shove and head-butt each other to win females during breeding season.",
            "description": "Male Bison are referred to as \u2018Bulls\u2019 and females are referred to as \u2018Cows\u2019. American Bison and European Bison are very similar in appearance. Bison are huge, powerful, aggressive bovine mammals with solid muscular heads and necks which are covered with brown shaggy fur. They use their very strong heads to shove and head-butt each other to win females during breeding season.Both males and females have sharp, curved horns extending from the sides of their heads which are used to defend themselves against predators. Bison have humped shoulders and short legs. Their tails are long and have a furry tuft at the end. Bison measure between 2.1 and 3.5 metres (7 \u2013 11 feet) in length and weigh between 350 \u2013 1,000 kilograms (770 \u2013 2,200 pounds). They stand around 2 metres (6.6 feet) tall. Males are slightly larger than females which is typical in ungulates.During the winter months, they have a dark brown thick coat which is shed and turns lighter brown in the summer months. European Bison are slightly less shaggy than their American relatives, however, they are more powerfully built. Bison have quite poor eyesight, however, their hearing and sense of smell is very good. They are able to detect another animal by smell at a distance of 3 kilometres.Some other physical and behavioural differences between the American Bison and the European BisonThe American Bison has 15 ribs, while the European Bison only has 14 ribs.The American Bison has four lumbar vertebrae, while the European Bison has five.Adult American Bison have shorter legs than the European Bison.American Bison tend to graze more and browse less due to their necks being set differently.The nose of the European species is set further forward than the forehead when the neck is in a neutral position.American Bison are hairier, though its tail has less hair than that of the European Bison.The horns of the European Bison point forward through the plane of their faces, making them more adept at fighting through the interlocking of horns in the same manner as domestic cattle, unlike the American Bison which favours charging.American Bison are more easily tamed than their European cousins and breed with domestic cattle more readily.",
            "habitat": "American Bison can be found in National Parks, prairies, woodlands and grasslands of North America. European Bison are found in forests and grasslands in large parts of Europe including England.",
            "diet": "Bison are herbivores and move around grasslands feeding on leaves, twigs, bark, berries and a wide variety of grasses and rushes. Their favourite plants include willow, aspen, ash, mistletoe and blackberry. They also eat mushrooms, ferns, lichens, mosses and acorns. Bison do not have a problem finding food during the winter as they swing their huge heads from side to side to disperse snow and find food.",
            "behaviour": "Mature bulls move in separate herds from the cows and their young. They join during the late summer which is their breeding season. Bulls will compete with each other for females by ramming and butting each other. A bull with its head lowered is a menacing spectacle.Bison often rub their shoulders and rumps against boulders and tree trunks and also enjoy taking mud and dust baths in shallow wet or dry depressions in the soil called \u2018wallows\u2019. This wallowing behaviour helps them to scratch off fly larvae and other parasites that live on their hides.Bison can run very fast despite their huge size and can reach speeds of up to 55 kilometres per hour. They are also excellent swimmers but are very buoyant and their heads, humps and tails stay above the waters surface. Bison rest during the day and do their grazing during the night and at dusk.The main predators of Bison are Wolves and sometimes Grizzly Bears. Bison display various defence behaviours, particularly bulls, when protecting cows and calves. Cows and calves are always at the front of a fleeing herd and the bulls remain at the rear to guard them.",
            "reproduction": "Bison breeding season occurs in late summer around August and September. Bison are polygamous (a mating structure in which a single individual of one gender has exclusive access to several individuals of the opposite gender).Dominant bulls maintain a small harem of females for mating. Following mating, the bull guards the female for several days to prevent other rival bulls from mating with her. After a gestation period of around 9 months, a single calf is born in the springtime. Births occur every 1 \u2013 2 years. Females and their young herd together to form \u2018playgroups\u2019 where calves socialise with each other.At around 2 months, calves begin to develop their distinctive shoulders, humps and horns which are used in playfights. The playfights allow them to develop their skills that ultimately serve in the ruts adult males undertake during breeding season. Young bison are lighter in color for their first 3 months of life.Young Bison are nursed for around one year. Very rarely, a calf may turn entirely white. White Bison are considered sacred by many Native Americans. Bison are sexually mature at the age of 1 \u2013 2 years. The life span of a bison is 20 years in the wild and 40 years in captivity.",
            "conservation status": "Bison are a near endangered species. Both the American and the European Bison were once in abundance, forming herds of over 2,000 individuals in their native habitats. However, American Bison were saved from extinction as they were almost wiped out completely by hunters in the 19th century as grasslands were cleared to make way for agriculture.European Bison are even more rarer than their American relatives. European Bison disappeared from Western Europe by the late middle ages and became extinct in Eastern Germany by the 18th century. Their main decline was due to loss of habitat and an increase in hunting as human populations increased across Northern Europe.By the 20th century, European Bison were only found in Poland and by 1925, both populations were extinct. However, new bison populations have been established from captive European Bisons in zoos."

The Black Caiman is found in various freshwater habitats such as slow-moving rivers, streams, lakes, flooded savannahs and wetlands. Although overlapping with the range of other caiman species in South America, it appears to occupy different habitat niches. The Black Caiman is the largest species in the family \u2018Alligatoridae\u2019. The Black Caiman can grow to 20 feet long (6 metres), making it the largest member of the Caiman family and the largest predator in the Amazon basin.",
            "black caiman reproduction": "The female Black Caiman constructs a mound nest (1.5 metre in diameter) during the dry season into which 30 to 65 eggs are laid. Nests can be found in both concealed and open locations. Females remain close to their nests.Once the eggs are ready to hatch, she will open the nest and assist in the hatching process. Hatching is reported to occur between 42 and 90 days, coinciding with the beginning of the wet season.As many females often nest within close proximity, the number of hatchlings in one area can be high. This leads to safety in numbers. Black Caimans sometimes eat their young.",
            "black caiman conservation status": "IUCN Red List: LRcd (Low Risk, Conservation Dependent).Estimated wild population: 25,000 to 50,000.Population recovery today is threatened by both continued illegal hunting and through increased competition with the more numerous Common Caiman (Caiman crocodilus).This latter species has moved into areas once inhabited by the Black Caiman and proliferated due to its increased reproductive capacity.Hunters can take both of these species with ease. Habitat destruction through deforestation and burning of swamplands (French Guiana) continues the onslaught."

The black-footed ferret is similar in appearance to the European polecat and the Asian steppe polecat. The black-footed ferret is native to central North America and are the only native species of ferrets native to North America. The domestic ferrets that you find in pet stores (Mustela furo) share the same genus, but these are of European origin and have been domesticated for hundreds of years. This north American ferret feeds primarily on prairie dogs and the decline in prairie dog populations is thought to have been the cause of the decline in black-footed ferret populations throughout the 20th century. In fact, the species was declared extinct in 1979, but a residual wild population was discovered in Meeteetse, Wyoming in 1981. Since then, a captive breeding program was created, helping to reintroduce the black-footed ferret into the wild.",
            "lifespan": "The average lifespan of the black-footed ferret is thought to be around one year in the wild, although it could be up to five years. The main causes of death in these animals are habitat loss, human-introduced diseases, and indirect poisoning from prairie dog control measures.",
            "diet": "Black footed ferrets are carnivores and feed primarily on prairie dogs, with up to 90% of their diet comprised of them. One ferret may eat over 100 prairie dogs in a year! The other 10% of their diet is made up of small rodents, such as mice and ground squirrels. They get all their water from their prey.They typically consume between 50 to 70 grams of meat per day. They only kill enough to eat, and very rarely store food for later. They hunt and kill prairie dogs in their burrows.",
            "black-footed ferret behavior": "The black footed ferret is a solitary animal, except during the breeding season or when females are caring for young. They are primarily nocturnal and spend most of their time underground in prairie dog burrows, which is where they sleep, catch their food, escape from predators and harsh weather, and give birth to their young.They dot hibernate but in winter, the amount of time they are active and the distances they travel decrease substantially. They have been found to remain underground in the same burrow system for a week at a time in winter.The rest of the year, they typically spend only a few minutes above ground each day during the first few hours following sunrise to hunt or find new burrows or mates. Males are generally more active than females, travelling about twice the distance that females do.Black-footed ferrets are also territorial and will actively defend territories against other same-sex competitors.Black-footed ferrets are very playful, especially as juveniles. Young at play will wrestle, arch their backs and hop backward with their mouths wide open, in a display known as the \u201cferret dance.\u201dThese animals are very vocal. They use a loud chatter as an alarm call, hissing to show agitation or fear, and females use whimpering sounds to encourage the young to follow.",
            "black-footed ferret reproduction": "The breeding season of the black-footed ferret is through March and April. Black-footed ferrets exhibit delayed implantation, in which the fertilized egg does not start developing until conditions are appropriate for gestation.The gestation period is 35 to 45 days, after which a litter of 1 to 6 young are born, although the average litter size is around 3 kits. Their dark markings appear at about 3 weeks of age and young kits begin to open their eyes about 35 days after birth. Black-footed ferret kits develop very rapidly and become increasingly active after their eyes open. They remain in the burrow underground for about 42 days, and will stay with their mothers throughout the summer before separating in the fall.Ferrets become sexually mature at 1 year of age, and their peak reproductive period is at about 3 to 4 years.\u00a0Black Footed Ferret Location and HabitatThe black footed ferret is native to North America and is the only ferret native to these parts. Today, they exists in the wild in three locations, northeastern Montana, western South Dakota, and southeastern Wyoming. All three locations are sites where they have been reintroduced after the original populations were extirpated.Historically, their range extended from southern Alberta and southern Saskatchewan south to Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.They primarily live in the short or middle grass prairies and rolling hills, and need around 100-120 acres of space for food sources. They live where there are prairie dog colonies and use prairie dog burrows for raising young, avoiding predators, and thermal cover.Black Footed Ferret Conservation StatusBlack-footed ferrets declined in population throughout the 20th century. This was due to decreases in prairie dog populations and the sylvatic plague. They were also harvested for the fur trade. They were listed as endangered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in 1967, and declared extinct in 1979, a residual wild population was discovered in Meeteetse, Wyoming, in 1981.This wild population was then bred in captivity and resulted in the reintroduction of black-footed ferrets into eight western US states, Canada, and Mexico from 1991 to 2009. They are now listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. Despite conservation efforts, unfortunately, without ample reintroduction sites and protection from plague, full black-footed ferret recovery remains difficult.Some common causes of death of the black-footed ferret include habitat loss, human-introduced diseases, and indirect poisoning from prairie dog control measures.Diseases that can kill black-footed ferrets include rabies, tularemia, and human influenza, but they are also susceptible to canine distemper virus, introduced by striped skunks, common raccoons, red foxes, coyotes, and American badgers.They are also susceptible to colder weather, with 50 to 70% of juveniles and older black-footed ferrets not making it through the fall and winter.However, the biggest threat to these animals is the decline in prairie dog populations and loss of prairie dog habitats. Habitat loss results from agriculture, livestock use, and other development. Loss of these areas can also be down to oil and natural gas exploration and extraction.",
            "predators": "The main predators of the black footed ferret are golden eagles, great horned owls, coyotes, American badgers, bobcats, prairie falcons, ferruginous hawks, and prairie rattlesnakes.\u00a0"

            "habitat and spider webs": "Black House spiders are commonly found by home-owners in window framing, under leaves, gutters, in brickwork and among rocks and bark.In the Australian bush, Black House spiders are usually found upon rough-barked trees which provide good shelter for their retreats among the cracks in the bark.The web of the Black House Spider has a \u2018funnel-like\u2019 shape, which is sometimes misunderstood as a Funnel-web Spider web. Their web is a messy-looking construction of triangular sail-like shapes, usually found stretched in the corner of the walls and windows. Somewhere in the web is a funnel-shaped entrance to the nest, where the spider spends most of its time, waiting for prey.The female Black House spider never leaves her web unless forced to and continuously repairs it. Old webs can look grey and woolly from constant additions of silk. Males, when ready to mate, go in search of females in their webs.",
            "diet": "Black House spiders particularly like trees that have been attacked by wood-boring insects, as the sap flowing from the bored holes attracts flies, beetles, butterflies, bees and ants, which the spider can prey upon easily.In the house, Black House spiders feed upon household pests attracted to the light of windows and lamps, where the spiders tend to build their webs. Electric lights attract their other prey which also includes moths and mosquitoes.",
            "reproduction": "When the male Black House spider finds a female in their webs, the male plucks the web of the female to attract her attention. Once the male has made sure that the female will be receptive, he can safely approach and inseminate her with his palps. They may then stay together for several days and may mate again several times.The female Black House spider constructs several white silk egg sacs, which are secured within the web retreat. The female stays with the eggs until they hatch. The spiderlings then disperse. The spiders mature during summertime and live for about two years.",
            "venom": "The Black House spider is venomous, however, it is not considered dangerous to humans, except for possible infection of the bite. Black House Spiders are quite shy, only coming out of the nest to capture their prey, then quickly retreating.A Black House Spiders bite may be quite painful and cause local swelling. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, sweating and giddiness are occasionally recorded. In a few cases skin lesions (Necrotising Arachnidism) have developed after multiple bites."

The Black Mamba snake is found in Eastern Africa, from southern Ethiopia to southwest Africa. ",
            "black mamba snake characteristics": "Adult Black mamba snakes have an average length of 2.5 metres (8.2 feet) and a maximum length of 4.5 metres (14 feet). The Black mamba snake receives its name from the black coloration inside of its mouth, rather than their skin color which is a grey to olive tone. The Black mamba snake is the fastest moving snake in the world, capable of moving up to 20 kilometres per hour (12.5 miles per hour). However it uses this speed to escape danger, rather than catch prey.",
            "black mamba snake habitat": "Black mamba snakes live primarily in scrub land and though not considered an arboreal species, can live in bushes and small trees.",
            "black mamba snake behaviour and diet": "Black mambas spend their nights in holes in the ground, usually disused burrows or hiding deep among fallen rocks or timber. These hiding places are also fled to by the snake if it becomes alarmed and it will attack any creature blocking the path to its hole.Like all reptiles, the black mamba snake is cold blooded and relies on external heat to maintain its body temperature. Therefore, it frequently basks in the sun during the day, either on a low branch or a rock, however, during the summer, the snake may be forced to take cover in its burrow if it becomes too hot.If left undisturbed, Black Mamba snakes tends to live in their lairs for long periods of time, which are often vacated insect mounds or hollow trees.Black mamba snakes are diurnal snakes that hunt prey actively day or night. When hunting small animals, the Black Mamba snake delivers a single deadly bite and then retreats, waiting for the neurotoxin in its venom to paralyze the prey. When killing a bird, however, the Black Mamba snake will cling to its prey, preventing it from flying away.Black mamba snakes travel quickly across rough ground or along low tree branches when hunting. Black mamba snakes are able to hold their heads up to one metre above the ground when striking and can hold them 50 centimetres above the ground even when moving. Black mamba snakes have very good eyesight and can strike their prey such as rodents, bats, birds and lizards like lightning, leaving their powerful venom to finish off the kill.",
            "black mamba snake reproduction": "Breeding usually takes place in late spring or early summer. After mating the male will return back to its own home. The female will then lay between 10 and 25 eggs, usually in decaying vegetation. The decomposition of the vegetation gives off heat, which helps to warm the eggs and speed up hatching time. The shells of the eggs allow water and oxygen to reach the developing embryos.Black mamba hatchlings are around 51 centimetres long and greyish-green in color. The hatchlings are independent immediately and can catch prey the size of a small rat. Within a year, they reach 2 metres. Young black mambas are preyed upon by mongooses and even adult black mambas are eaten by the secretary bird and larger species of eagle.",
            "black mamba snake venom": "Black mamba snakes are among the ten most venomous snakes in the world. The Black mamba snake is more than three times as venomous as the Cape Cobra, over five times as venomous as the King cobra and about forty times as venomous as the Gaboon viper. Black mambas venom contains powerful, rapid-acting neurotoxins (alters the normal activity of the nervous system) and cardiotoxins (causes heart muscle damage), including calciseptine.The Black Mambas bite delivers about 100 \u2013 120 milligrams of venom on average, however it can deliver up to 400 milligrams of venom, 10 to 15 milligrams is deadly to a human adult. The venom is injected through two hollow fangs at the front of its mouth which lie flat until the snake bites, at which point small, movable mouth bones erect them. The venom causes rapid paralysis. Enzymes in the snakes saliva start to digest the prey before it even reaches the stomach and most prey is digested within a few hours.In humans, the initial symptom of a bite is local pain in the bite area, although not as severe as snakes with hemotoxins (toxins that destroy red blood cells). The victim then experiences a tingling sensation in the extremities, drooping eyelids (eyelid ptosis), tunnel vision, sweating, excessive salivation and lack of muscle control (specifically the mouth and tongue). If the victim does not receive medical attention, symptoms rapidly progress to nausea, shortness of breath, confusion and paralysis.Eventually, the victim experiences convulsions, respiratory failure and coma and dies due to suffocation resulting from paralysis of the muscles used for breathing. Without treatment the mortality rate is 100%, the highest among all venomous snakes in the world."

Some populations of black necked stilt are migratory birds and move to the ocean coasts in winter. The black necked stilt belongs to the genus Himantopus and the order Charadriiformes. It is often treated as a subspecies of the common or black-winged stilt, using the trinomial name Himantopus himantopus mexicanus. The Hawaiian stilt is sometimes considered a subspecies of the black necked stilt. These birds have a healthy population and a large range. Despite the fact that North American populations of the black-necked stilt have somewhat declined in the 20th century, they are listed as Least Concern by the IUCN Red List.",

Black necked stilts also feed on tadpoles, mollusks, water beetles and other aquatic insects, snails, small fish, flying insects and seeds of aquatic and marsh plants.They forage in shallow water, usually wading, but are capable of swimming if they need to. They also forage in mudflats and lakeshores, and have to bend their legs in order to reach the ground with their beaks. They locate their prey by sight and snap it up quickly, using their long slender beaks to probe for food in the mud and sand. Sometimes they completely submerge their head underwater, swiping their head and bill through the water.",
            "location and habitat": "The black necked stilt is found around Atlantic and Pacific coasts, some inland states, the Gulf Coast region, Mexico, South America, West Indies, and Hawaii. They breed along both coasts of the United States, from Oregon and Delaware southward, and locally in western interior states east to Idaho, Kansas, and Texas. They winter along the Pacific Coast north to central California and also in Florida and other Gulf Coast states. The northernmost inland populations winter in South America (Brazil and Peru), the West Indies, the Galapagos Islands, and along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts to southern Mexico, the Baja Peninsula and Hawaii.Black necked stilts prefer sandy beaches, shallow wetlands and both salt and fresh water. They are found in fresh and salt water marshes, salt ponds, lake shores, mudflats, wet savannas, pools, grassy marshes and flooded fields. They also use man-made structures, such as drainage ditches and sewage and salt ponds.",
            "behavior": "Black-necked stilts are gregarious and roosting is small groups. They are very territorial and will defend a large area, working cooperatively with their neighbors. They patrol for predators and males are more aggressive, uttering a sharp alarm call, mobbing, and flying low over intruders, including people. They have an anti-predator display called \u201cthe popcorn display\u201d in which a group of adults will encircle a ground predator and hop side to side while flapping their wings. Their sound is a sharp yipping and is continuous if disturbed.When there is danger of over-heating in hot climates, the black necked stilts have a technique called \u201cbelly-soaking\u201d which is the transport of water in the ventral feathers.",
            "migration": "Black necked stilts are a migratory species. During March to May, those wintering in southern climes migrate in flocks of about 15 to their northern or inland breeding grounds. Those summering in northeast California and southeastern Oregon migrate to lowland and coastal areas.After the breeding season, from August to September, juveniles gather in small groups before leaving the breeding grounds. The most northern breeders will make a long migration, stopping along the way for food, in fields, marshes, wetlands, and mudflats, to winter in Brazil, Peru, the West Indies, the southern coasts of the Atlantic and Pacific in the US, Mexico, and Hawaii.During October to February, feeding takes place on their wintering grounds (e.g., Brazil, Peru, the West Indies, the southern coasts of the Atlantic and Pacific in the US, Mexico, and Hawaii). For feeding areas they prefer coastal estuaries, salt ponds, lakeshores, alkali flats and even flooded fields.",
            "reproduction": "Reproduction occurs from late April through August in North America, with peak activity in June while tropical populations usually breed after the rainy season. Pairs form on wintering grounds, during migration, or on the breeding grounds, and remain monogamous for a single breeding season. For roosting and resting needs, this bird selects alkali flats (even flooded ones), lake shores, and islands surrounded by shallow water. Both sexes choose the nest site.Black necked stilts build their nests in both fresh and salt marshes and shallow coastal bays. The nests are typically sited within 1 km (0.62 mi) of a feeding location. The spacing between nests is approximately 65 ft (20 m). Their nests are quite shallow and built in the marshy ground, lined with grass, weeds, twigs, or shell fragments. The nest is scraped by either sex while the other sex watches.Black necked stilts usually lay 3 to 5 buff colored eggs (44 mm (1.7 in long), which are spotted with brown. Both parents incubate the eggs for about 25 days. Once hatched, the young are capable of swimming after just two hours. The young black necked stilts are tended by both parents. The parents are extremely protective of their young and will fly at intruders or practice the crippled-bird act to draw predators away from their young.The black necked stilt chicks look similar to the adults, but are light brownish grey with black spots and are very well camouflaged. When the adults give an alarm call, the chicks scatter and lay flat against the ground. The chicks are able to fly about 4 weeks after hatching. They breed at about 1 or 2 years old.\u00a0Black Necked Stilt Conservation StatusOverall, the population of the black necked stilt is healthy and occurs over a large range. They are listed as Least Concern by the IUCN Red List. However, the North American populations of the black necked stilt have somewhat declined in the 20th century, mainly due to conversion of habitat for human use and pollution affecting both the birds directly as well as their food stocks.The Hawaiian stilt, which is sometimes considered a subspecies of the black necked stilt, is very rare and its numbers are less than 2,000 individuals.",

            "desc": "The Black rhinoceros (Diceros Bicornis), is sometimes called the \u2018Hooked-lip rhino\u2019. The rhinoceros is a mammal in the order Perissodactyla and is native to the eastern and central areas of Africa including Kenya, Tanzania, Cameroon, South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe. Although the Rhino is referred to as black, it is actually more of a grey-white color in appearance. It will sometimes take on the color of the soil that it lives around. The scientific name for a Black Rhinoceros is Diceros Bicornis. An adult Black Rhinoceros stands 140 \u2013 170 centimetres (57.9 \u2013 63 inches) high at the shoulder and is 3.3 \u2013 3.6 metres (10.8 \u2013 11.8 feet) in length. An adult weighs from 800 to 1400 kilograms (1,760 to 3,080 pounds), some may weigh 1820 kilograms (4,000 pounds), with the females being smaller than the males.",
            "diet": "The Black Rhinoceros is a herbivore that eats leafy plants, branches, shoots, thorny wood bushes and fruit. The Black Rhinos diet helps to reduce the amount of woody plants which results in more grasses growing for the benefit of other animals.",
            "vocalisation": "The Black Rhino has a wide vocal range and can possibly communicate the same way as an elephant can by frequencies well below the range of human hearing. Breathing is also an important part of rhino communication.",
            "behaviour": "Black Rhinos are heavy browsers that restrict woody plants from over-growing in their habitat. This is important because it allows grasses to grow which provides food for many other animals on the grassy plains.Black Rhinos have a tendency to attack just about anything, this is because of their poor eyesight. Black Rhinos have been known to attack trees and rocks by mistake. They rely heavily on their strong sense of smell and well developed hearing.If it catches a smell of an unfamiliar presence, then it will instinctively charge mistaking it as a threat. Most of their \u2018charges\u2019 are bluffs but because they act in this way, they have been given a bad reputation as being aggressive and dangerous.Black Rhinos do however, live in harmony with other animals generally. Black Rhinos will attack other animals though if their territory is threatened, they also fight amongst themselves. Black Rhinos will fight each other over territory and females \u2013 even courting males and females sometimes fight one another.Black Rhinos use the larger of their two horns as a weapon when fighting. Sometimes it can break off, however, this regenerates and grows back eventually.",
            "reproduction": "Adult Black Rhinoceroses are solitary in nature, coming together only for mating. Mating does not have a seasonal pattern, however, births tend to be towards the end of the rainy season in drier environments.The gestation period of a female Black rhino is 16 months. She will give birth to one single calf. The calf will weigh about 100 pounds at birth.Female Black rhinos will use their horns to protect their young from predators such as lions and hyenas. Although they are fierce, Black rhinos do have a softer side.Black rhino mothers are very affectionate towards their young and will look after them for years, protecting them and teaching them how to survive independently. Unlike a White rhino calf, a Black rhino calf will run behind its mother. Young Black rhinos will live with their mother until another sibling is born, they are about 2 years old when this happens and are almost adult size and ready to go off and live independently.",

            "desc": "The Black Widow spider (Latrodectus spp.) is a spider notorious for its neurotoxic venom (a toxin that acts specifically on nerve cells). The Black Widow Spider is a large widow spider found throughout the world and commonly associated with urban habitats or agricultural areas. The name \u2018black widow spider\u2019 is most commonly used to refer to the three North American species best known for their dark coloration, black hair and red hourglass pattern.",
            "characteristics": "Female black widow spiders are shiny black when full grown. Since the females commonly eat their mate after mating (as do many other spiders) they often are actually \u2018widows\u2019. This is probably how they got their name. Black Widow Spiders have an hourglass shaped marking on the underside of their abdomen which, although most commonly red, may range in color from white to yellow to various shades of orange and red. Black Widow Spiders also have a small, usually red colored dot near the spinnerets, which is separate from the hourglass.In the northern black widow spider (Latrodectus variolus), the two halves of the hourglass shape may be separated into two separate patches. A large female black widow spider can grow to about 1.5 inches (38 millimetres), including leg span. Their body measures about 0.5 \u2013 0.6 inches (12 \u2013 16 millimetres). Male black widow spiders are half the size of the female or even smaller. They have longer legs and a smaller abdomen in relation to their body size. They are also usually dark brown with varying colors of stripes or dots, with no hourglass mark. Adult males can be distinguished from juvenile females by their more-slender body, longer legs and large pedipalps (a second pair of appendages of the main body part) typical of most other male spiders.As with many venomous creatures, the brightly colored markings serve as a warning to predators. Eating a black widow spider will not normally kill a small predator (birds), however, the sickness that follows digestion is enough for the creature to remember that the bright red marking means \u2018do not eat\u2019. Males bear similar marks to the females to serve as warning while they are searching for mates, however, the marks are not as prominent (not as brightly colored, or as large).Male black widow spiders, being less venomous, are less of a threat to predators, therefore having less prominent but similar marks helps predators to better judge their prey (some large birds can eat male widows without adverse effect and so only avoid female spiders).As is characteristic of all arthropods, black widow spiders have a hard exoskeleton composed of chitin and protein.",
            "habitat and spider webs": "Black Widow spiders prefer to nest near the ground, in dark, undisturbed areas. Nest sites are often near holes produced by small animals, or around construction openings and wood piles. Low shrubs also are common sites for black widow spiders to occur. Indoors, black widow spiders similarly occur in dark, undisturbed sites such as behind furniture or under desks. Undisturbed basement areas and crawl spaces of homes are also used by nesting widow spiders.Black Widow spiders build loose and irregular mesh-type webs, often on plants, in loose stone or wood piles or in the corners of rooms, garages or outbuildings. They do not produce the symmetrical web typical of orb weaving spiders (Araneidae) or the distinctive funnel pattern web of the funnel weaver spiders (Agelenidae).",
            "diet": "Black widow spiders typically prey on a variety of insects, however, they occasionally feed upon woodlice, diplopods, chilopods and other arachnids.When the prey is entangled by the web, the spider quickly comes out of its retreat, wraps the prey securely in its strong web, then punctures and envenoms its prey. The venom takes about ten minutes to take effect. In the mean time, the prey is held tightly by the spider. When movements of the prey cease, digestive enzymes are released into the wound. The black widow spider then carries its prey back to its retreat before feeding.",
            "reproduction": "When a Black Widow male is mature, he spins a sperm web, deposits semen on it and charges his palpi with the sperm. Black widow spiders reproduce sexually when the male inserts his palpus into the females spermathecal openings. The female deposits her eggs in a globular silken container in which they remain camouflaged and guarded. A female black widow spider can produce 4 to 9 egg sacs in one summer, each containing about 100 \u2013 400 eggs. Usually, eggs incubate for 20 to 30 days.Rarely do more than 100 spiderlings survive through this process. On average, 30 will survive through the first molting, due to cannibalism, lack of food, or lack of proper shelter. It takes 2 to 4 months for black widow spiders to mature enough to breed, however full maturation typically takes 6 to 9 months. The females can live for up to 5 years, while a males life span is much shorter.",
            "venom": "Although their venom is extremely potent, (15 times more potent than that of the rattlesnakes, it is also reported to be much more potent than the venom of cobras and coral snakes), these spiders are not especially large.Spiders bite, but they do not sting even though it sometimes feels like it has stung you. Compared to many other species of spiders, their chelicerae are not very large or powerful. In the case of a mature female, the hollow, needle shaped part of each chelicera, the part that penetrates the skin, is approximately 1.0 millimetres (around 0.04 inch) long, sufficiently long to inject the venom to a dangerous depth.The males, being much smaller, can inject far less venom and inject it far less deeply. The actual amount injected, even by a mature female, is very small in physical volume. When this small amount of venom is diffused throughout the body of a healthy, mature human, it usually does not amount to a fatal dose (though it can produce the very unpleasant symptoms of latrodectism \u2013 the clinical syndrome caused by the neurotoxic venom). Deaths in healthy adults from black widow spider bites are relatively rare in terms of the number of bites per thousand people.The bite itself can cause muscle and chest pain. The pain also may spread to the abdomen, producing cramping and nausea. Other general symptoms include: restlessness, anxiety, breathing and speech difficult, and sweating. Swelling may be noticed in extremities (hands and feet) and eyelids but rarely at the bite site. Often there is a general sense of discomfort shortly after the bite and acute symptoms increase in severity during the first day after a bite. Symptoms usually decline after two to three days however, some mild symptoms may continue for several weeks after recovery."

However, both male and female aggressively defend the eggs.When the young hatch, they are blind and featherless. The parents will raise only the strongest chick, leaving the others to starve to death. The young Macaws do not develop their full plumage until they are at least 10 weeks old.

Macaws can be trained to sit on a perch, but if it is caged, its beautiful tail feathers will be ruined because they are so long.Macaws require much more effort \u2013 and more knowledge \u2013 from owners than more traditional pets such as dogs or cats. Macaws are intelligent and loving, so for someone who can provide for their needs, they make good companion animals.As pets, macaws require a varied diet, a seed only diet will lead to health problems such as vitamin deficiency. An example of a good diet would be a quality pellet mix, in conjunction with a mix featuring seed, nuts and dried fruits, with fresh vegetables and fruits fed regularly; furthermore, it is quite common (and appreciated by the parrot) to partake with their human owners of safe foods like pasta, bread, etc. It is important to avoid foods with high fat content (generally) while striving to provide a wide variety of foods.There are some foods which are toxic to birds and parrots as a group. Cherry pits, avocados, chocolate, and caffeine are some foods that should not be fed. Chocolate and caffeine are not metabolised by birds the same way they are in humans."

            "blue-ringed octopus diet": "The blue ringed octopus feeds on crustaceans, such as crabs and shrimps, and other invertebrates. They will also take advantage of small fish, especially injured ones, if they can catch them.To catch prey, the blue-ringed octopus pounces on it, seizing it with its tentacles and bringing it towards the mouth. It then uses its horny beak to pierce through the tough exoskeleton of the prey and releases venom. The venom paralyzes the muscles required for movement, in turn killing the prey.",
            "blue-ringed octopus behavior": "Blue-ringed octopuses spend most of their time hiding in crevices. Like all other octopus, they can change shape easily, which helps them to squeeze into crevices much smaller than themselves. If they are provoked, they can change their color very quickly. They can become bright yellow and each of their 50 to 60 rings flashes bright blue as a warning display. These flashes are achieved by using muscles which are under neural control. Generally, the rings are not visible, or are very faint, when the octopus is as rest.Although the blue ringed octopus is very small, it is very deadly. It carries enough venom to kill 26 adult humans within minutes. The toxin of these octopuses is created by a bacteria present in their salivary glands. Their bites are often painless, and victims may not know they have been bitten until symptoms start to show.The major neurotoxin component of the blue ringed octopus bite is a compound that was originally known as maculotoxin but was later found to be identical to tetrodotoxin.The venom can result in nausea, respiratory arrest, heart failure, severe and sometimes total paralysis, blindness, and can lead to death within minutes if not treated. Death is usually from suffocation due to paralysis of the diaphragm.Despite their powerful venom, the blue-ringed octopus is not actually an aggressive animal. The first instinct of this octopus when cornered is to flee. If the threat persists, the octopus will then change its colors. If touched, the octopus will then use its venom.The blue-ringed octopus flattens out its body on the bed for hiding from its enemies. It will also change its body color in order to blend into its surroundings.",
            "blue-ringed octopus reproduction": "The blue-ringed octopus begins mating when the male approaches a female and begins to caress her with his modified arm, the hectocotylus. The male then grabs the female, often completely obscures the female\u2019s vision, and transfers sperm packets by inserting his hectocotylus into her mantle cavity repeatedly. Mating continues until the female has had enough, and in at least one species the female has to remove the over-enthusiastic male by force.Female blue ringed octopuses lay only one clutch of about 50 to 100 eggs in their lifetimes. This usually stems place towards the end of fall. The eggs are then incubated underneath the female\u2019s arms for about six months, and during this process she does not eat. As soon as the eggs hatch, the female dies because she has not eaten.The hatchlings are tiny, about the size of a pea, but grow very quickly. By the time they are a month old they are able to hunt for food, and, by the time they are a year old, the new offspring reach maturity and are able to mate.Male blue-ringed octopus displays homosexual behavior attempting to copulate with both the males and the females, and of all sizes. However, interactions between the males are most often shorter that ends with the mounting octopus withdrawing its modified arm without struggle or packet insertion.",
            "": "Blue-Ringed Octopus Location and HabitatThe blue-ringed octopus can be found in the Pacific and Indian oceans, from Japan to Australia. These octopuses reside in tide pools and coral reefs and are bottom dwellers, inhabiting sandy and silty areas, and will even live inside empty sea shells, discarded bottles, and cans. They can usually be found at depths between 0 to 20 meters (or sometimes 50 meters). The blue-ringed octopus will come out of its shelter only to hunt for food or to search for a mate.\u00a0Blue Ringed Octopus Conservation StatusBlue-ringed octopuses are not endangered, and have not been listed on the IUCN Red List. Despite this, it is thought that these animals are threatened, mostly by humans. Rising sea temperatures and habitat loss is a big concern for the population of the blue-ringed octopus, as is over fishing. Blue-ringed octopuses are also commonly captured for aquarium display.These animals are important to their ecosystem because they help control populations of Asian date mussels.

The head of the bird is a pale cinnamon-brown with dense white streaks. On the back of the neck, there is a white patch where the neck connects to the mantle. The lower breast, central tail feathers and under parts are white. Its blue tapered bill has serrated edges that enables the bird to tightly grasp fish. The Blue-footed Booby bird is a little under three feet long and its wingspan is about five feet. The Blue-footed Booby bird plunges head first into the ocean, with its wings partly folded, to catch fish. It even catches flying fish when they are still in the air. The Blue-footed Booby bird can also dive for fish while it is in a swimming position."

There, it is known as \u2018Wowla\u2019 to the natives of Belize. Boa Constrictors can been seen throughout the forest and sometimes in off shore caves. Boa Constrictors have two subfamilies: \u2018Boinae\u2019 or true boas and \u2018Erycinae\u2019 or sand boas. Pythons are sometimes classified as a subfamily of Boidae, but are frequently listed under their own family, \u2018Pythonidae\u2019. Sand boas are also frequently listed under their own family, \u2018Erycidae\u2019. ",
            "boa constrictor description": "Boa Constrictors vary in color from a pinkish brown to grey with distinguished markings called \u2018crossbands\u2019 along their body. The Boa Constrictor is the largest snake in the Belize Rianforest, reaching an amazing length of 12 feet from head to tail tip. Boa Constrictors have large curved teeth which are used to grasp prey in.The longest ever recorded Boa Constrictor is said to have been 18 feet long, thats over 3 times as long as you or me if you are about 5 feet tall.Female Boa Constrictors are usually larger than males. Boa Constrictors contain many subspecies based on locality. The Boa Constrictors from the Amazon Basin are the most colorful, possessing bright cherry red tails. It used to be said that boas were New World Snakes and pythons were Old World Snakes, but, with boas found on Madagascar, Fiji and Solomon Islands, this is not quite true. Instead, it is possible that boas have survived in evolutionarily isolated areas.",
            "boa constrictor diet": "Boa Constrictors easily populate areas where there is food such as rodents and songbirds. Boa Constrictors will also feed on lizards, small mongoose, bats, rats, squirrels, iguanas and other small mammals.",
            "boa constrictor behaviour": "The Boa Constrictor has no venom unlike many other snakes, but when threatened they will hiss and strike their opponent, their bite can be very, very painful. Boa Constrictors use constriction to suffercate their prey. When the prey has been suffocated the Boa eats it whole. It can take several weeks for a Boa to digest its food completely.Boa Constrictors use \u2018heat sensitive pits\u2019 on their heads to sense their surroundings because they have bad eyesight.",
            "boa constrictor reproduction": "Boa Constrictors are seasonal breeders. The female of the species can give birth to as many as 50 young at any one time. Unlike many other reptiles and snakes, they give birth to live young instead of laying eggs.",
            "boa constrictor sub species": "Sub Family BoinaeSnakes of the subfamily \u2018Boinae\u2019 are found in Madagascar, Papua, Pacific Islands and the Neotropics. It has been suggested that genera within each of these particular areas do not form monophyletic groups (groups consisting of an inferred common ancestor and all its descendants).The sub species are:Boa (one species: Boa constrictor, also called the Red-tailed Boa)Acrantophis (Dumeril\u2019s Boa and Madagascar Ground Boa; sometimes equated with Boa)Sanzinia (Madagascar Tree Boa; sometimes equated with Boa)Eunectes (Anacondas)Corallus (Tree boas)Epicrates (Rainbow boas)Candoia (Pacific boas)Sub Family ErycinaeCompared to true boas, erycines are quite small, with most members remaining well under a metre in length. Fossil erycines have been found in rock strata over 50 million years old and were once widespread in North America. Now, only two species remain in North America, as well as the sand boas in Africa, Asia and southeastern Europe.At least three erycine species lay eggs: the Calabar Boa, (Calabaria reinhardtii) (once classified as a python for this reason), the Arabian Sand Boa, (Eryx jayakari) and the West African Sand Boa, (Eryx muelleri).The sub species are:Eryx (Sand boas)Gongylophis (Rough-tailed Sand Boa)Charina (Rubber Boas)Lichanura (Rosy boa, sometimes equated with Charina)Calabarinae (Calabar Python, sometimes equated with Charina)"

It inhabits warm and temperate seas worldwide and may be found in all but the Arctic and the Antarctic Oceans. Bottlenose Dolphins prefer shallow, inshore waters and are commonly seen off the coasts of Hawaii and Florida. The scientific name for a Bottlenose Dolphin is \u201cTursiops truncatus\u201d. Relatives of the Bottlenose Dolphin include the Pacific White-sided Dolphin (Lagenorhynchus Obliquidens), distinguished by its tapering head, grey-white belly and tall dorsal fin, The Risso\u2019s Dolphin (Grampus Griseus), which is identified by its large size and blunt, beakless head and the White-beaked Dolphin (Lagenorhynchus Alborostris), a large acrobatic swimmer with a stubby tail.",
            "bottlenose dolphin characteristics": "Bottlenose Dolphins have streamlined, torpedo-shaped bodies that enables them to glide swiftly through the ocean. Bottlenose Dolphins range in color from cream to charcoal or almost black. Usually, their backs are darker and their bellies are lighter. The elongated upper and lower jaws give the animals their name of Bottlenose.The real nose however is the blowhole on top of the head, and the nasal septum is visible when the blowhole is open. Their face shows a characteristic \u2018smile\u2019. Bottlenose Dolphins grow 2 \u2013 4 metres (6 \u2013 13 feet) in length and weigh around 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds). Male Bottlenose Dolphins are slightly longer and considerably heavier than females on average.Bottlenose Dolphins have distinctive skin markings that help them camouflage from potential predators. Their tails have two horizontal paddles, called \u2018flukes\u2019 which contain no bones or muscles, these help power them through the water.",
            "bottlenose dolphin behaviour": "This highly intelligent aquatic mammal has always been depicted as one of mans best ocean friends. The largest of the beaked dolphins, it is named for its short, stubby beak which resembles the top or neck of a bottle.Bottlenose Dolphins live in social groups called \u2018Schools\u2019 or \u2018Pods\u2019 containing up to 12 individuals These are long-term social units. Typically, a group of females and their young live together in a pod, and juveniles in a mixed pod. Several of these pods can join together to form larger groups of one hundred dolphins or more. Males live mostly alone or in groups of 2 \u2013 3 and join the pods for short periods of time.The Bottlenose Dolphin is commonly known for its friendly character and curiosity towards humans immersed in or near water. It is not uncommon for a diver to be investigated by a group of them and they are often quite receptive to being gently patted or stroked. Occasionally, dolphins have rescued injured divers by raising them to the surface, a behaviour they also show towards injured members of their own species.Bottlenose Dolphins are predators however, and they also show aggressive behaviours. This includes fights among males for rank and access to females, as well as aggression towards sharks and other smaller species of dolphins. Male dolphins, during the mating season, compete very vigorously with each other through showing toughness and size with a series of acts such as head butting.Often seen riding the bow wave of a boat and \u2018breaching\u2019 (doing belly-flops), the Bottlenose Dolphin can leap several metres out of the water. They perform these high leaps and somersaults to breathe and also to communicate with each other.Bottlenose Dolphins sleep about eight hours a day, swim speeds of 12 miles per hour and dive for up to 20 minutes at depths of 300 metres (1,000 feet).",
            "bottlenose dolphin diet": "Their diet consists mainly of small fish, occasionally also squid, crabs, octopus, and other similar animals. Bottlenose Dolphins feed on around 8 \u2013 15 kilograms of food per day.Bottlenose Dolphins have 18 \u2013 27 pairs of small conical teeth in both jaws. Their peg-like teeth serve to grasp but not to chew food.When a shoal of fish has been found, the animals work as a team to keep the fish close together and maximize the harvest. Bottlenose Dolphins also search for fish alone, often bottom dwelling species. Sometimes they will employ \u2018fish whacking\u2019 whereby a fish is stunned (and sometimes thrown out of the water) with the fluke to make catching and eating the fish easier.",
            "bottlenose dolphin senses and communication": "Bottlenose Dolphins communicate with each other using body language and distinctive whistles, clicks and sounds produced by six air sacs near their blow hole (they lack vocal cords). Each animal has a characteristic frequency-modulated narrow-band signature vocalization (signature whistle) which is uniquely identifying. Other communications use about 30 other distinguishable sounds.",
            "bottlenose dolphin reproduction": "The main breeding season for the bottlenose dolphin is between March and April.Courtship \u2013 Courtship behaviour of the male includes clinging along to the female, posing for the female, stroking, rubbing, nuzzling, mouthing, jaw clapping, and yelping. Copulation is preceded by lengthy foreplay; then the two animals arrange themselves belly to belly, the penis extends out of its slit and is inserted into the vagina. The act lasts only 10 \u2013 30 seconds, but is repeated numerous times, with several minutes break in between.Gestation and Birth \u2013 The gestation period of the female Bottlenose Dolphin is 12 months. Calves are born in midsummer in European waters and between February and May in Florida. The young are born in shallow water, sometimes assisted by a \u2018midwife\u2019 (which may be male). The new single calf measures about 1 metre (3 feet) long at birth.To speed up the nursing process, the mother can eject milk from her mammary glands. There are two slits, one on either side of the genital slit, each housing one nipple. The calf is nursed for 12 to 18 months.The young live closely with their mother for up to 6 years. The males are not involved in the raising of their offspring. The females become sexually mature at age 5 \u2013 12 years, the males a bit later, at the age of 10 \u2013 12 years.",
            "bottlenose dolphin natural predators": "Large shark species such as the tiger shark, the dusky shark, and the bull shark prey on the Bottlenose Dolphin. However, the dolphin is far from helpless against its predators and it has been known to fight back by charging at its attacker. The Orca may also prey on it, but this seems very, very rare.",
            "bottlenose dolphin conservation": "Although still generally plentiful, Bottlenose Dolphins have been virtually wiped out in some places. They are hunted for meat and other products in parts of the worldIn the Pacific, they are often drowned in tuna nets, although new \u2018dolphin-friendly\u2019 nets are now being used more widely. There have also been concerns about man-made marine noises such as shipping sonar. These noises upset whales and dolphins and affect their ability to feed, navigate and communicate. Evidence suggests that military submarine detection systems producing Low Frequency Active Sonar, floods the oceans with noise and threatens the survival of whales and dolphins by destroying their hearing and causing their ears and lungs to haemorrhage.",
            "dolphins and humans": "Bottlenose Dolphins (as well as other dolphins) are often trained to perform in dolphin shows. Some animal welfare activists claim that the dolphins there are not adequately challenged and that the pools are too small; others maintain that the dolphins are well cared for and enjoy living and working with humans.Eight Bottlenose Dolphins that were washed out of their aquarium pool during the devastating August 2005 strike of Hurricane Katrina were later found alive by rescue forces, huddled together in coastal waters near their former home in Gulfport, Mississippi, USA.Direct interaction with dolphins is used in the therapy of severely handicapped children.",
            "more bottlenosed dolphin information": "Some of the largest Bottlenose dolphins\u00a0in the world live in the oceans surrounding the UK. They generally vary greatly in size, however, UK dolphins tend to be around a metre longer than those living off Florida in the USA. There are two types of the Bottlenose dolphin \u2013 those who live inshore are generally smaller and thinner and those who live offshore who are larger and fatter.Dolphins in warmer, shallower waters tend to have a smaller body than their cousins in cooler pelagic waters.For example, a survey of animals in the Moray Firth in Scotland, the worlds northernmost resident population, recorded an average adult length of just under 4 metres (13 feet). This compares with a 2.5 metres (8 feet) average in a population of Florida. Those in colder waters also have a fattier composition and blood more suited to deep-diving. Bottlenose dolphins are easily recognisable by their dark and curved-back dorsal fin on their grey bodies.Every 5 \u2013 8 minutes, the Bottlenose Dolphin, like all other dolphins, needs to rise to the surface to breathe through its blowhole, though it generally breathes more frequently \u2013 up to several times per minute.Bottlenose Dolphins live in social groups called \u2018Schools\u2019 or \u2018Pods\u2019 containing up to 12 individuals.

There are over 15 species of Baleen Whales that inhabit our oceans. The scientific name for the Bowhead Whale is Balaena mysticetus. Bowhead whales have massive bony skulls which they use to break from beneath the ice to breathe. Some hunters have reported whales surfacing through 60 centimetres (2 feet) of ice in this method.",

            "behaviour": "Bowhead whales are the only baleen whales that spend their entire lives in and around Arctic waters. The bowhead whales found off Alaska spend the winter months in the southwestern Bering Sea. They migrate northward in the spring, following openings in the pack ice, into the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, hunting krill and zooplankton.Bowhead whales are slow swimmers and usually travel alone or in small herds of up to six animals. Although they may stay below the water surface for as long as forty minutes in a single dive, they are not thought to be deep divers.Bowhead whales are highly vocal and use underwater sounds to communicate while traveling, feeding and socializing. Some Bowhead whales make long repetitive songs that may be mating displays.The Bowhead whales behaviour can also include breaching, tail slapping and spy-hopping. Sexual activity occurs between pairs and in boisterous groups of several males and one or two females.",
            "reproduction": "Breeding has been observed from March through August; conception is believed to occur primarily in March. Reproduction can begin when a whale is 10 to 15 years old. Female Bowhead whales produce a calf once every 3 to 4 years, after a 13 to 14 month gestation period. The newborn calf is about 4.5 metres long and approximately 1000 kilograms (2,200 pounds), growing to 9 metres by its first birthday.",
            "lifespan": "The lifespan of a Bowhead whale was once thought to be 60 to 70 years, similar to other whales. However, discoveries of antique ivory spear points in living whales in 1993, 1995 and 1999 have triggered further research based on structures in the whales eye, leading to the reliable conclusion that at least some individuals have lived to be 150 \u2013 200 years old (another report has said a female at the age of 90 was allegedly still reproductive).Because of their possible life span, female bowhead whales are believed to go through menopause. Observations of very large animals without calves support this hypothesis.",
            "": "Bowhead whales have been killed for their blubber, meat, oil, bones and baleen. Century-old harpoons have been found embedded in some whales blubber, showing how old they can get and how they were attacked. Bowhead whales are closely related to the right whale and share with it the hunting-ideal characteristics of slow swimming and floating after death.Before commercial whaling, there were over 50,000 bowhead whales in the north polar region (estimated). Commercial whaling starting in 1611 near Svalbard and Greenland and wiped out herds of the slow-growing whales, and then moved on to new areas. In the North Pacific, the commercial whaling began in the mid-1800s and within two decades over 60 percent of the bowhead whale population had been wiped out.Commercial whaling, the principal cause of the population decline, has been discontinued. The population off Alaska has increased since commercial whaling ceased. Alaska Natives continue to kill small numbers of bowhead whales in subsistence hunts each year.This level of killing (25 \u2013 40 animals annually) is not expected to affect the populations recovery. The bowhead whale population off Alaskas coast (also called the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort stock) appears to be recovering but remains at about 7,800 animals (1990), roughly 41 percent of the pre-whaling population.The status of the other bowhead populations is less well known. These stocks are thought to be very small, probably in the low hundreds, for a possible worldwide population of 8,000 \u2013 9,200 individuals."

They are large hairy spindly-looking spiders who have eight eyes, two of which are large. Brazilian wandering spiders are fast-moving spiders, their legs are strong and spiny and they have distinctive red jaws which they display when angered.The Brazilian wandering spider is not a Tarantula. Brazilian wandering spiders are not even in the same family group. Tarantulas are harmless to humans and are mostly ambush killers who wait for prey to come to them. Brazilian wandering spiders are active hunters. Brazilian wandering spiders and Tarantulas do have one thing in common, however, they do not eat bananas.\u00a0",
            "habitat and spider webs": "The Brazilian Wandering spider is so-called because it wanders the jungle floor, rather than residing in a lair or maintaining a web. This is another reason it is considered so dangerous. In densely populated areas, the Brazilian Wandering spider will usually search for cover and dark places to hide during daytime, leading it to hide within houses, clothes, cars, boots, boxes and log piles. This usually causes accidents when people disturb them.The Brazilian Wandering spider is also called the \u2018banana spider\u2019 as it is occasionally found within shipments of bananas. As a result, any large spider appearing in a bunch of bananas should be treated with due care.\u00a0",

            "reproduction": "All spiders produce silk, a thin, strong protein strand extruded by the spider from spinnerets most commonly found on the end of the abdomen. Many species use it to trap insects in webs, although there are many species that hunt freely such as the Brazilian Wandering spider. Silk can be used to aid in climbing, form smooth walls for burrows, build egg sacs, wrap prey and temporarily hold sperm, among other applications.Brazilian Wandering spiders reproduce by means of eggs, which are packed into silk bundles called egg sacs. The male spider must (in most cases) make a timely departure after mating to escape before the females normal predatory instincts return.Mature male spiders have swollen bulbs on the end of their palps for this purpose and this is a useful way to identify whether the spider is male or female. Once the sperm is inside the female spider, she stores it in a chamber and only uses it during the egg-laying process, when the eggs come into contact with the male sperm for the first time and are fertilized. The Brazilian Wandering spiders life cycle is 1 \u2013 2 years.\u00a0",
            "venom": "Bites from the Brazilian Wandering spider may result in only a couple of painful pinpricks to full-blown envenomed. In either case, people bitten by this spider or any Ctenid should seek immediate emergency treatment as the venom is possibly life threatening.The Phoneutria fera and Phoneutria nigriventer (two species of wandering spider) are the two most commonly implicated as the most vicious and deadly of the Phoneutria spiders.The Phoneutria not only has a potent neurotoxin, but is reported to have one of the most excruciatingly painful envenoms of all spiders due to its high concentration of serotonin. They have the most active venom of any living spiders.One of their members, the Brazilian Huntsman, is thought to be the most venomous spider in the world. Brazilian wandering spiders are certainly dangerous and bite more people than any other spiders."

The Harvest mouse has a coat of fur which is colored reddish/brown, sometimes yellow/brown.It has white, furry underparts, small furry ears, a blunt muzzle/nose and it is the only British animal with a truly prehensile tail that can be used as a fifth limb. This prehensile tail is long, scaly, ringed and thinly haired. When wrapped around a stem, the prehensile tail can act as a brake or anchor. This makes the mouse very nimble when traveling and feeding in stems of cereals and grasses.Harvest mice have a remarkable ability to sense vibrations through the soles of their feet. Larger animals nearby can be sensed by vibrations passing through the ground and up the plant on which the mouse is feeding.",

They prefer tall, dense vegetation including reed beds, hedgerows, reed beds, allotments, roadside verges, gardens as well as cereal sown fields, particularly, cornfields and undisturbed areas.Non-breeding nests are constructed of loosely woven, shredded grass at the bottom of plant stems, under rocks or in abandoned birds nests. The summer breeding nests are the size of an orange, compact balls of grass or corn blades interwoven among shrubs or stalks, often in standing corn and lined with thistle down. Breeding nests are built in stems high above the ground. The spherical nests are about 10 centimetres in diameter. Non-breeding nests are smaller (5 centimetres in diameter) and may be built closer to the ground or in buildings.",
            "harvest mouse diet": "The Harvest mouse mainly feeds up on seeds, fruits, nectar and bulbs, however, a tiny proportion of their diet is made up of insects, particularly in the summer, as well as roots, moss and fungi.

The female Harvest mouse has a gestation period of 17 \u2013 19 days after which a litter of 1 \u2013 8 young are born. Three litters may be produced per year, sometimes several. The female mouse abandons the young after 15 \u2013 16 days, however, the young may still use the nest for a further few days. A new nest is built for each new litter. Around 99% of adult mice do not survive the winter. Harvest mice have an average life span of between 12 \u2013 18 months.",
            "harvest mouse conservation status": "Harvest mice are categorised as Lower Risk by the IUCN Red List. Modern farming methods have caused a reduction in hedgerows, and combine harvesters leave harvest mice in grain fields with little chance of escape.Conservation efforts have taken place in England as of 2001.

It differs slightly in that it has no band of yellow fur around the neck, is slightly smaller in size, darker in color and has smaller ears.The pre-breeding season population of Wood mice is estimated to be in excess of 38 million.",
            "wood mouse description": "Fully grown Wood mice measure around 8.1 \u2013 10.3 centimetres from nose to tail. Their tails measure 7.1 \u2013 9.3 centimetres in length and they weigh 13 \u2013 27 grams. Wood mice gain weight during the summer. Wood mice have generally dark brown fur on the top part of their bodies with white/grey undersides. They have large protruding eyes, large ears and long tails.",
            "wood mouse habitats": "Wood mice are found in fields, gardens, woods, scrubs, open grasslands and hedgerows throughout Britain and Ireland. They live in underground burrow systems, usually under the roots of trees, that contain a series of nest chambers, runs and food stores. Nests usually consist of a ball of dry grass, moss and leaves. However, the Wood Mouse will live just about anywhere there is plenty of food and shelter.",
            "wood mouse diet": "The Wood mouse has a varied omnivorous diet, eating nuts, berries, seeds, acorns, haws, seeds, fungi, spiders and rose hips as well as small insects and larvae. They will also eat invertebrates, worms, carrion (dead animal carcasses) and other similar food. Food is stored in underground burrows or occasionally in disused bird nests.",
            "wood mouse behaviour": "If caught by its tail, a wood mouse can quickly shed the end of it, however, it may never regrow. The wood mouse does not hibernate and, despite its name, it prefers hedgerows to woodland.The wood mouse is mainly nocturnal. It will sit up and wash itself all over, especially if scared. The Wood mouse is an excellent climber and will leap high in the air when disturbed. They have superb hearing and excellent vision (hence the large eyes and ears). Unfortunately, it has many enemies including weasels, stoats, cats, foxes, moles and owls. They are a vital source of food for other larger nocturnal hunters particularly owls.Wood mice nest wherever there is cover and warmth, this usually means below ground however, they can also be found in hedgerows, buildings, car radiators and other similar dwellings.",
            "wood mouse reproduction": "Wood mice breed from March to October, with a breeding peak from July to August. They produce 4 \u2013 7 litters consisting of 2 \u2013 9 young per year. Wood mice can reproduce quite frequently with the gestation period around 25 days. Females can breed at the age of 2 months. Young mice are usually out on their own after 4 weeks. This short parenting enables them to breed often. Wood mice have a life span of around 18 \u2013 20 months, however, very few survive 2 winters. They tend to have a shorter life span of 6 \u2013 12 months in the wild as many creatures prey on them . They live longer in captivity and when conditions are favourable.",
            "wood mouse conservation status": "Wood mice are common and are not considered to be an endangered species.Yellow-Necked MouseThe Yellow-necked Mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) is closely related to the wood mouse, with which it was long confused, only being recognised as a separate species in 1894. It differs in its band of yellow fur around the neck and in having slightly larger ears and usually being slightly larger overall. When sitting upright its characteristic yellow-brown collar patch can be seen, distinguishing it from the wood mouse.In Britain, they are concentrated around the Welsh borders, the western Cotswolds and south-eastern counties. As with the wood mouse, they range across Europe through to Central Asia, however, they range further North in Scandinavia than the wood mouse.Yellow-necked mice are rarer in Britain than the Wood mice. They are mainly restricted to southern England and Wales.The Yellow-necked mouse pre-breeding season population is estimated to be up to 750,000.",
            "yellow-necked mouse description": "Yellow-necked mice measure around 9 \u2013 1.3 centimetres in length from nose to tail and have a tail length of 9 \u2013 13.5 centimetres. They weigh between 15 and 30 grams. Both Yellow-necked mice and Wood mice are larger than House mice.Yellow-necked mice have dark brown fur on the top parts of their bodies with paler undersides and orange colored flanks. They have a yellow collar patch, large protruding eyes, large ears and long tails.",
            "yellow-necked mouse habitats": "Yellow-necked mice have home ranges generally of less than 0.5 hectares, which often overlap with other individuals.The Yellow-necked mouse prefers mature woodlands, hedgerows and wooded gardens. They Nest below ground, under the stumps or roots of trees and their nests consist of a ball of dry grass, moss and leaves.",
            "yellow-necked mouse diet": "The Yellow-necked mouse is an omnivore and feeds up on seedlings, buds, fruit, nuts, insects, larvae and spiders. Their food is stored in underground burrows or occasionally in disused bird nests. Their diet is similar to that of the Wood mouse.",
            "yellow-necked mouse behaviour": "Yellow-necked mice are nocturnal and are agile climbers. They can climb trees and sometimes overwinter in houses.",
            "yellow-necked mouse reproduction": "Yellow-necked mice breed from February to October, with a breeding peak from July to August. Usually, 3 litters of 3 \u2013 10 young are produced per year. Gestation period lasts for 23 days. The young are weaned after 3 weeks. Their distinctive yellow collars become visible after 2 weeks, at about the same times as they first open their eyes.The Yellow-necked mouse has a life span of 12 \u2013 24 months. Very few survive two winters.",
            "yellow-necked mouse conservation status": "Worldwide, yellow necked-mice are considered to be common and therefore not classed as an endangered species."

Moles are very common throughout Britain, however, they are rarely seen as they spend almost their entire life underground. The British Moles pre-breeding season population is estimated to be around 31,000,000. Male moles are called \u2018boars\u2019 and female moles are called \u2018sows\u2019. A group of moles is called a \u2018labour\u2019. ",
            "\u2013 description": "Moles measure around 14 centimetres in length and have a 2.8 centimetre tail. Moles are built highly adapted for their underground digging way of life. A mole can dig its way through an amazing 14 metres of soil in just one hour.Moles have a cylindrical body, very strong shoulders and broad, spade-like fore limbs with claws. Its pink snout is hairless and extremely sensitive.A moles body is covered in a soft, thick, silver-black fur, which hides the small eyes. In some cases, moles eyes are quite covered with fur and skin. This state of the eyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse also aided perhaps by natural selection. Moles have no external ears and have very poor eyesight, however, they have instead, excellent senses of smell and touch.",
            "mole habitats": "The British moles preferred habitats are wooded hilly districts in the north and west of England, Wales and Scotland. A spherical ball located in the burrow in the centre of their territory is lined with dry grasses and leaves collected from the surface.",
            "mole diet": "British Moles are carnivores feeding almost exclusively small invertebrate animals living underground such as earthworms and the larvae of beetles and flies.A mole may also occasionally catch small mice at the entrance to its burrow. Because their saliva contains a toxin that can paralyze earthworms, moles are able to store their still living prey for later consumption. They construct special underground \u2018larders\u2019 for just this purpose. Researchers have discovered such larders with over a thousand earthworms in them. Before eating earthworms, moles pull them between their squeezed paws to force the collected earth and dirt out of the worms gut.",
            "mole behaviour": "British Moles sleep, feed and breed in their tunnels. Moles occasionally appear above ground at the top of one of their characteristic molehills, and even then usually only the head and pink fleshy snout is revealed.Moles have a well developed sense of orientation retaining a mental plan of their complex layout of underground tunnels.The uniform texture of the fur allows it to lie in any direction, making it easier for the animal to reverse rapidly in the tunnels.When the soil is shallow or subject to flooding, large molehills known as \u2018fortresses\u2019 may be formed. These fortresses can measure up to a metre in height and contain a nest chamber and several radial tunnels.The moles tail is carried erect and the hairs on the tip give the mole information about its surroundings by brushing against the tunnel roof. Moles burrow in lawns, raising molehills and killing the lawn, for which they are sometimes considered pests. They can undermine plant roots, indirectly causing damage or death. Contrary to popular belief, moles do not eat plant roots.",
            "mole reproduction": "Female moles give birth to one litter per year containing 2 \u2013 7 young. Gestation period is 4 weeks. The young leave the mother when about 5 weeks old. The average life span of a mole is 2.5 years.",

Water voles have rounder noses than rats, deep brown fur, chubby faces and short fuzzy ears and unlike the rat their tails, paws and ears are covered with hair. In the wild, they survive for 5 months on average, most do not survive a second winter. In captivity, they survive for a maximum of 5 years.  Water voles reach 5 \u2013 9 inches in length (120 \u2013 235 millimetres) plus a tail of 55% \u2013 70% of this. Adult Water voles weigh from 6 \u2013 12 ounces (160 \u2013 350 grams), juveniles weigh less but must reach around 5 \u2013 6 ounces (140 \u2013 170 grams) to be able to survive their first winter.

Now confined to the Scottish highlands, wild cats disappeared from southern England in the 16th century, with the last one recorded in northern England being shot in 1849. The Wildlife and Countryside Act gives strict legal protection to wild cats and their dens. Wild Cats are easily confused with \u2018feral\u2019 cats, which are domestic cats living wild and of which there are about 900,000 in Britain today. Wild cat pre-breeding season population is estimated to be no more than 2,000. Some estimates are even lower and extinction is considered likely.",

Shoulder height averages around 35 centimetres (14 inches) and tail length is about 30 centimetres (12 inches).Wild cat fur is grey/brown in color with creamy underparts and dark stripes. The African subspecies tends to be a little smaller and a lighter brown in color.As aforementioned, the wild cat closely resembles the domestic tabby cat, however, the wild cat is more striped and has a bushier, blunt-ended tail marked with thick black rings.",
            "wild cat habitats": "In its native environment, the Wild cat is adaptable to a variety of habitat types such as savanna, open forest and steppe. They also inhabit moor land, with pasture, scrub and forests in Scotland, north of Edinburgh and Glasgow, but not on the islands. In winter, bad weather drives them down into more sheltered wooded valleysWild cats make lairs in a foxes earth, under tree trunks, in hollow trees, in bracken or in a deserted buzzards nest.",
            "wild cat diet": "The wild cat is an obligate carnivore, like all felines and consumes almost every part of any kill it makes; the coat providing roughage, the bones calcium and the meat everything else, in fact they rarely need to drink because meat has such a high water content. The Wildcat often carries parasitic worms in its gut and will eat long blades of grass to help clear out its system and probably also to obtain certain necessary acids not present in meat.The wild cat is a hunter of small mammals, birds, rabbits, hares and game and other creatures of a similar size. They sometimes scavenge and cache prey to return to it later.",
            "wild cat behaviour": "The Wild cat is extremely timid. It avoids approaching human settlements. The wild cat lives solitarily and holds a territory of about 3 kilometres squared. Males overlap ranges with females, however, females will not overlap ranges with other females.Wildcats are mainly crepuscular (active during dawn and dusk). As is the case with all the smaller cats, wildcats cannot roar, however, they do use a variety of other sounds to communicate including growling, meowing, purring and hissing.",
            "wild cat reproduction": "Wild cats mate in February and March and produce 1 litter of 3 \u2013 5 kittens after a gestation period of 63 \u2013 68 days. Kittens are born with hair but are blind and deaf. Their eyes open after 9 days and they emerge from the den at 4 \u2013 5 weeks old. They accompany their mother on hunting trips after 10 \u2013 12 weeks. Second litters occasionally occur in August. Wild cats have an average life span of 12 years.",
            "wild cat conservation status": "The wild cat has suffered considerable decline in population and is now considered at serious risk of extinction in Britain. The Scottish wild cat is now a critically endangered species. The Mammals Trust UK claims the species say a revamp of current measures to protect and conserve the population could save them from dying out. They blame the wildcat decline on the intrusion of domestic cat genes into the population which has left only a few hundred pure animals in the wild."

The Broad-Snouted Caiman is a highly aquatic species which is found primarily in mangroves, marshes and swamps (freshwater and brackish) throughout its distribution, together with habitat associated with numerous small Atlantic river drainages.  The Broad-Snouted Caiman has also been found in mangrove habitat surrounding small coastal islands in southeast Brazil.",
            "broad-snouted caiman diet": "The Broad-Snouted Caiman specialises in aquatic (ampullarid) snails, but will also take a wide variety of other invertebrates and small vertebrates (e.g. fish, amphibians). Larger animals are able to take larger prey and their jaws are well-suited to crushing turtle shells.The incidence of fluke parasites in cattle has increased in areas where the Broad-Snouted Caimans used to be common. It has been suggested that the decline of the caiman has resulted in increased number of snails \u2013 an intermediate host for the parasites.",
            "broad-snouted caiman reproduction": "Captive breeding in zoos have shown that this species builds a mound nest into which 20 to 60 eggs are usually laid. In the wild, nests will often be built on isolated river islands.Nest construction occurs during the rainy season (although it is slightly earlier in more northerly latitudes) and may be assisted by the male.Eggs are reported to be laid in two layers, which may help to create a slight difference in temperature between the two layers and a slightly different sex ratio in the embryos. Incubation period is approximately 70 days.Females have been observed opening the nest during hatching and assisting the young to the water, where they will be guarded for an indeterminate period by either one or both parents.",
            "broad-snouted caiman conservation status": "The Broad-Snouted Caiman is classed as low risk \u2013 least concern. Commercial hunting in the middle of the century has taken its toll on wild populations. Illegal hunting still persists, but is not now considered to be a threat to the species because caimans are harder to find, making hunting less attractive and more costly when traders can obtain better quality legal skins of higher quality.Although protection for the species has increased, it still faces the major threat of habitat destruction \u2013 deforestation pressures (e.g. hydroelectric projects, draining of vast areas for agriculture) are very severe around Brazil and Uraguay where this species exists.Pollution entering waterways from developing cities is also contributing to habitat degradation.

There are over 100 species of the Recluse spider, the Brown Recluse spider being the best known of the species.\u00a0 The Brown Recluse Spider is a reclusive creature that seeks and prefers seclusion. The Brown Recluse Spider and ten additional species of Loxosceles are native to the United States. In addition, a few non-native species have become established in limited areas of the country. The Brown Recluse Spider is found mainly in the central Midwestern states southward to the Gulf of Mexico. Their native range lies roughly south of a line from southeastern Nebraska through southern Iowa, Illinois and Indiana to southwestern Ohio. In the southern states, the Brown Recluse Spider is native from central Texas to western Georgia. Brown Recluse Spiders are generally not found west of the Rocky Mountains. A related species, the brown violin spider, is found in Hawaii.",
            "characteristics": "In the mature brown recluse spider as well as some other species of recluse spiders, the dark violin marking is well defined, with the neck of the violin pointing toward the bulbous abdomen.The Brown Recluse Spiders colors can range from a light tan to a dark brown, however, they can also appear a deep yellow color. Brown Recluse Spiders are covered with many fine hairs that give the spider a velvet appearance. They have long, thin brown legs which are also covered with fine hairs.Adult Brown Recluse Spiders have a leg span of about 24 millimetres. Their body is around 3 \u2013 8 millimetres long and about 3 \u2013 16 millimetres wide. Males are slightly smaller in body length than females, however, males have proportionally longer legs.Both male and female brown recluse spiders are venomous. The juvenile stages closely resemble the adults except for their size and they are a slightly lighter color. Whereas most spiders have eight eyes, recluse spiders have only six eyes that are arranged in pairs in a semicircle on the forepart of the cephalothorax (the first (anterior) major body section), with one median pair and two lateral pairs.Only a few other spiders have 3 pairs of eyes arranged this way, such as the Spitting Spiders (scytodids). Brown Recluse Spiders can be distinguished from scytodids as recluse spiders abdomens have no coloration pattern nor do their legs, which also lack spines.",
            "habitat and spider webs": "The Brown Recluse Spiders habitat is usually a dark, undisturbed site which sometimes can be either indoors or outdoors. In their favoured habitats, their populations are usually dense. Brown Recluse Spiders thrive in human-altered environments. Indoors, they may be found in attics, basements, crawl spaces, cellars, cupboards and closets.Brown Recluse Spiders may seek shelter in storage boxes, shoes, clothing, folded linens, hanging picture frames and behind furniture. They also may be found in outbuildings such as barns, sheds, greenhouses and garages. Outdoors, brown recluse spiders may be found underneath logs, loose stones in rock piles and stacks of wood. Brown Recluse Spiders seem to favour cardboard when dwelling in human residences, possibly because it mimics the rotting tree bark which they naturally inhabit.Brown Recluse Spiders build irregular webs that frequently include a shelter consisting of disorderly threads of very sticky, off-white to greyish threads. The web serves as the spiders daytime retreat and it is often constructed in an undisturbed corner in one of the locations mentioned above. Unlike most web weavers, Brown Recluse Spiders leave these webs at night to hunt. Males will move around more when hunting while females do not usually stray far from their web.",
            "diet": "Like most spiders, Brown Recluse spiders mainly prey upon insects.",
            "reproduction": "Brown Recluse Spiders lay eggs from May through July. The female lays about 50 eggs that are encased in an off-white silken sac that is about 2 \u2013 3 inches in diameter. Each female may produce several egg sacs over a period of several months. Spiderlings emerge from the egg sac in about a month or less. Their development is slow and is influenced by weather conditions and food availability. It takes an average of one year to reach the adult stage from time of egg deposit. Adult Brown Recluse Spiders often live about 1 to 2 years. Brown Recluse Spiders can survive long periods of time (about 6 months) without food or water.",
            "venom": "As indicated by their name, Brown Recluse Spiders are not aggressive and usually bite only when pressed against human skin, such as when tangled up within clothes, bath towels or in bedding.Actual Brown Recluse Spiders are rare. Brown Recluse Spider bites may produce a range of symptoms known as \u2018loxoscelism\u2019 (a condition produced by the bite and characterized by a gangrenous slough at the site of bite, nausea, malaise, fever, hemolysis and thrombocytopenia).Most Recluse Spider bites are minor with no necrosis. However, a small number of bites produce severe dermonecrotic lesions and sometimes, severe systemic symptoms. The physical reaction to a Brown Recluse Spider bite depends on the amount of venom injected and an individuals sensitivity to it.Some people are unaffected by a bite, whereas others experience immediate or delayed effects as the venom kills the tissues (necrosis) at the site of the bite. Many Brown Recluse Spider bites cause just a little red mark that heals without event. The vast majority of Brown Recluse Spider bites heal without severe scarring.Initially, the bite may feel like a pinprick or go unnoticed. Some may not be aware of the bite for 2 to 8 hours. Others feel a stinging sensation followed by intense pain. Infrequently, some victims experience general systemic reactions that may include restlessness, generalized itching, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or shock. A small white blister usually initially rises at the bite site surrounded by a swollen area. The affected area enlarges and becomes red and the tissue is hard to the touch for some time.The bite of the Brown Recluse Spider can result in a painful, deep wound that takes a long time to heal. Fatalities are extremely rare, however, bites are most dangerous to young children, the elderly and those in poor physical condition.Spiders that Look Like The Brown Recluse"

This shark lives in both salt and fresh water, less than 100 feet (30 m) deep. They belong to the family Carcharhinidae, the requiem sharks, and the genus Carcharhinus, which also contains 34 other species of shark, including the Galapagos shark. Bull sharks get their name from the short, blunt shape of their snouts and their aggressive behavior. They are the third most dangerous sharks towards humans, just behind the great white shark and the tiger shark. This species feeds on bony fish and small sharks, including other bull sharks, and stingrays. They are generally a solidarity animal, but may pair with another bull shark briefly for hunting. The word \u201cCarcharhinus\u201d in the bull shark\u2019s scientific name means sharp-nosed, because most sharks in this family, like the tiger shark, have very pointed noses. However, bull sharks are an exception to this, as they have short, rounded, blunt noses. The word \u201cleucas\u201d is derived from the Greek word \u201cleucos,\u201d which means white, and describes the bull shark\u2019s underside.",
            "lifespan": "The average lifespan of the bullshark is around 32 years. The actual lifespan of these animals can depend on the geographic region. In the southern Gulf of Mexico, it was indicated that they can reach an age of 28 years for females and 23 years for males. In the northern Gulf researchers found that female bull sharks live to be 24.2 years old and the oldest male was 21.3 years old.They are known to live a lot longer in captivity.",
            "diet": "Bull sharks are carnivores, with their diet primarily consisting of bony fish, such as catfish. They also commonly eat stingrays and other sharks, even other bull sharks. Other prey they feed on include, dolphins, sea turtles, birds, crustaceans, and echinoderms. Bull sharks cannot survive by eating plants because their bodies cannot digest them.They are opportunistic feeders, which means that they eat just about anything they find, and they aren\u2019t picky about their food. The bull shark is generally a solitary hunter, but will pair with another bull shark to hunt if needed. They tend to hunt in murky waters, where it is harder for their prey to see them coming, and have been known to use the bump-and-bite technique to attack their prey.Bull sharks tend to eat in short bursts, but when food is scarce, they can digest their food for a much longer period of time in order to avoid starvation. If attacked by a predator, bull sharks will regurgitate the food in their stomachs in order to escape. This is to distract their predator, as the predator may go after the regurgitated food instead of the bull shark.",
            "behavior": "Bull sharks are known to be quite aggressive in nature. For this reason, they are rarely popular to keep in aquariums because they tend to kill everything in their environment.Bull sharks are generally solitary animals, although they will team up with other bull shakers to hunt. A group of sharks is usually called a school, but may also be called a shoal.They don\u2019t have very good eyesight, but have a great sense of smell that allows them to sniff out their prey. They also have a very good sense of hearing. They are fast animals, and can swim at a speed of 25 miles per hour (40 km/h).Some bull sharks are seasonally migratory. Bull sharks that inhabit the east coast of the United States will spend summers in northern latitudes and move southward again when waters cool.Bull sharks are able to regulate themselves to live in either fresh or salt water. They can live in fresh water for their entire life, but this does not happen, mostly due to their reproductive needs. Young bull sharks leave the fresh water in which they are born and move out into the sea to breed. Whilst it is theoretically possible for bull sharks to live purely in fresh water, the primary food source for bull sharks resides in salt water, so they could be at risk of starvation.",
            "reproduction": "Little is known about bull shark reproduction. They mate during late summer and early autumn and are polygynandrous. Males have a tendency to bite during copulation, which is often why females display mating scars.This species is viviparous and the young are carried in a yolk-sac placenta. The gestation period usually lasts 10 to 11 months, after which the young are born live and free-swimming. The other gives brith to 1 to 13 young, called pups, which are born tail first. At birth, bull sharks weigh between 1.5 and 3.0 kg and are approximately 60 and 71 cm in length.Bull sharks normally give birth in fresh water or in the brackish water of freshwater river mouths. They do not rear their young, but the young use nursery areas in estuaries for protection. The young have more opportunities to stay safe from predators in fresh water, because the majority of sharks are only able to survive in salt water and so will not prey on the young bull sharks in these areas. They also have greater food supply in these nurseries.As soon as they are born, the pups begin hunting for themselves, eating small fish and crustaceans and anything else they can catch and swallow. Female sharks mature around the size of 160 to 170 cm, and male bull sharks reach sexual maturity around 160 to 165 cm. Female bull sharks reproduce every other year.\u00a0Bull Shark Location and HabitatThe bull shark is found worldwide, along the coasts of the United States, Mexico, Central and South America, Africa, India, and Australia. The bull shark is diadromous, meaning they can swim between salt and fresh water with ease, and are therefore also found in many estuaries, lakes and rivers of these countries. These estuaries are used as nurseries for the young sharks.They have been found in the Amazon River in South America, the Mississippi River in the United States, the Brisbane River in Australia, the Tigris River in the Middle East, and the Ganges River in India. Bull sharks are the only shark species that can tolerate prolonged periods in fresh water environments.Bull sharks reside in tropical and subtropical water, at a depth of around 30 m, but can exist at depths up to 150 m near the coast. They are often found in shallow water where humans are, which is the reason for common bull shark attacks. Some bull sharks migrate each year, particularly female sharks ready to give birth, who move to fresh water areas.\u00a0Bull Shark Conservation StatusBull sharks are found almost all over the world, but they are considered Near Threatened by the IUCN. Their exact population is unknown. The numbers of bull sharks appear to be shrinking, and at least one study has found that bull sharks are not growing as large as they used to, which is most likely due to the bigger ones being killed.The main threat to bull sharks is humans. They are hunted by people for their oil, hide, and meat. They may also be affected by human interference with their habitat, particularly because they reside in such shallow water. In rivers, lakes and estuaries, especially where young bull sharks reside, human interference could be affecting this shark\u2019s population greatly. Human development in coastal waters and shorelines may also threaten bull sharks.",
            "predators": "Bull sharks are at the top of the food chain and therefore have very few natural predators. However, they have been known to be preyed on by other, larger sharks and occasionally crocodiles. Injured and smaller bull sharks can be targeted by other bull sharks. The main predator of bull sharks is humans.",
            "importance": "Bull sharks and the small remora fish blue streak (Labroides dimidiatus) have a mutual relationship. If the bull shark is infected with parasites it will change its behavior so that the remora will know. The shark will then slow down its swimming speed and swim with its head raised, and the remora will approach and clean all around the shark\u2019s body, gills, and inside the mouth. This allows the remora to eat, but also means the bull shark will get rid of the unwanted parasites.Bull sharks are also used for economic importance by humans. Despite being very aggressive and eating all of the other fish in the tank, bull sharks are sometimes kept in aquariums and zoos and can adapt to life in a tank. Their aggressive nature often makes them a popular attraction to visitors. Thee animals are also caught for their liver oil, meat, and skin, which can be used for a wide range of cosmetics, leather and food.Bull Shark FAQsWhat is the difference between a bull shark and a bullhead shark?Bullhead sharks and bull sharks do not have many similarities, aside from the fact they are both sharks. Bullhead sharks are a lot smaller than bull sharks, usually measuring about 5 feet (1.5 m), which is less than half the size of a bull shark. Bullheads also have long, thin bodies and prominent \u201chorns\u201d on their heads, which gives them their name.Both of these animals eat similar foods, but bull sharks are able to eat much larger prey than bullheads. Another difference is that bullhead sharks are not as aggressive as bull sharks, and are not a threat to humans like bull sharks.Where do bull sharks live?Bull sharks live in both saltwater and fresh water. This means they live both in the sea and in estuaries, lakes and rivers. They live in shallow areas where humans can be found when swimming, which is why the occurrence of bull shark attacks are much higher than other shark species.What do bull sharks eat?Bull sharks are carnivores and mainly eat bony fish, but they also feed on stingrays, dolphins, sea turtles, birds, crustaceans and even other bull sharks!Can bull sharks kill humans?Bull sharks are extremely dangerous to humans because they are pretty aggressive. Along with the great white shark and tiger shark, they are among the three most likely to attack humans. In recent records, 33 people have been killed by bull sharks.The reason for the more common nature of bull shark attacks than other sharks are because humans use the same bodies of water that these sharks reside in. Because they live in shallow coastal waters and lakes and rivers, they are much more likely to come across humans than other shark species.These animals also do not have very good eyesight and hunt by smell. Therefore, they may attack humans because they think they are another prey! They are also territorial and will respond quickly to intruders.\u00a0"

            "desc": "Bumblebees are large, hairy bees and are close relatives of the well-known honeybee. Most species of bumblebee live in colonies, but their colonies are much smaller than the honey bees or wasps who can have up to several thousand individuals, the bumblebee colony will only consist of around 50 \u2013 150 individuals. (You might hear the bee on the left buzzing)!  We can recognise Bumble Bees from their very loud buzzing. They can be seen bobbing around flowers and are a good indication that spring is here.",
            "bumble bee characteristics": "We can recognise Bumble Bees from their very loud buzzing. They can be seen bobbing around flowers and are a good indication that spring is here.Bumblebees are usually a very distinctive black and yellow color, although they can be red and black or orange and black. Another obvious (but not unique) characteristic is the soft nature of the long, branched setae, called pile, that covers their entire body, making them appear and feel fuzzy. The female worker bumblebee has a stinger and is capable of stinging although they are never too willing to sting. A male bumblebee has no stinger and therefore cannot sting.A bumblebee does not have ears, and it is not known whether or how a bumblebee can hear sound waves passing through the air, however they can feel the vibrations of sounds through wood and other materials. The heart, like that in most other insects, runs down the entire length of the body. Their fat body is a nutritional store. Before hibernation, queens eat as much as they can to enlarge their fat body. The fat in the cells is used up during hibernation.You can take a bumblebee in your hand and as long as you do not treat it roughly, it will not sting you at all. However, if you see a bumblebee lying on its back, then it is best not to touch it. This position is a defensive position and they will feel threatened and prepare to sting.Unlike the honeybee, the worker bumblebee does not leave its sting in your skin when it has stung you, this means it is capable of stinging you more than once. The poison they inject with a sting is harmless, but can be harmful to those allergic to wasp stings.Just like mammals, bumblebees control their own body temperature. They can detach the muscles which they use to move their wings. By moving the detached muscles rapidly they produce their own body heat. This is the reason you can sometimes find a motionless bumblebee on the ground or on a flower. It is not dying or sick, but simply heating up its own body and they are unable to fly because of their wing muscle detachment.Bumblebees keep a body temperature of 34 to 38 degrees centigrade, this is why it is common to see bumblebees even on colder and rainy days in the spring and summer. Only in winter, when temperatures drop, they will go into hibernation. Honeybees, however, will only become active only when temperatures are above 15 degrees centigrade.",
            "bumble bee diet": "Bumblebees do not store food (honey) to survive the winter. The little food they do store is saved to feed the larvae and the egg-producing queen, or is used to survive cold, windy and rainy days. Like their relatives the honey bees, bumblebees feed on nectar and gather pollen to feed their young.Just like social wasps, the bumblebee colony will die off at the end of summer. The new queens will then find somewhere to hibernate during the winter, usually underground and emerge to find new nesting ground ready to start a new colony in spring.",
            "bumble bee pollination": "Bumblebees are very important pollinators to many plants, flowers and fruit trees. It is very interesting to quietly observe a bumblebee at work. Watch them in your garden \u2013 without disturbing them \u2013 and see how fascinating they are.Bumblebees generally visit flowers exhibiting the bee pollination syndrome. They can visit patches of flowers up to 1 \u2013 2 kilometres from their colony. Bumblebees will also tend to visit the same patches of flowers every day, as long as nectar and pollen continue to be available. While foraging, bumblebees can reach ground speeds of up to 54 kilometres per hour.In a few species of bumble bee, once it has visited a flower, it leaves a scent mark on the flower. This scent mark deters visitation of the flower by other bumblebees until the scent disappears.Once they have collected nectar and pollen, bumblebees return to the nest and deposit the harvested nectar and pollen into brood cells, or into wax cells for storage. Unlike honey bees, bumblebees only store a few days worth of food and so are much more vulnerable to food shortages.However, because bumblebees are much more opportunistic feeders than honey bees, these shortages may have less profound effects. Nectar is stored essentially in the form it was collected, rather than being processed into honey as is done in honey bees. It is therefore very dilute and watery and is rarely consumed by humans.",
            "bumble bee conservation status": "In Britain, until relatively recently, 19 species of native true bumblebee were recognised along with six species of cuckoo bumblebees. Of these, three have already become extinct, eight are in serious decline and only six remain widespread. A decline in bumblebee numbers could cause large-scale changes to the countryside, due to inadequate pollination of certain plants. Bumble Bees are an endangered species.\u00a0"

Most of these beetles are shiny black in color and have orange-red markings on their elytra. Burying beetles are known as the undertakers of the animal world, because they bury the carcasses of small vertebrates such as birds and rodents as a food source for their larvae. As of 2006, there are over 60 extant species of burying beetle, which includes the American burying beetle, the largest of the carrion beetles. They can be found in only four states: Rhode Island, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Arkansas, and Nebraska. Other species of this beetle can be found generally in northern Europe. The numbers of these beetles has been declining in more recent decades. The reason for this population decline is unknown, but it is thought it might be to do with habitat loss. Some species have largest populations than others, and this beetles can be found quite commonly in Europe. However, the American burying beetle is currently listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List.",
            "lifespan": "The average burying beetle lifespan is around 12 months.",
            "diet": "The burying beetle feed on carrion (dead animals). They are scavengers and use their antenna to detect dead meat. These beetles are not picky with what they will eat and will eat insects, mice, voles, opossums, birds, snakes and fish.While buying beetles don\u2019t care so much about what they eat, they do care more about the size. If it is a small animal, the adult beetles will eat the food themselves. However, if it is a very large animal, they\u2019ll use it as food for their young.",
            "behavior": "The burying beetle gets its name because it buries its food. Once these beetles have found a carcass (most likely that of a small bird or a mouse), they fight amongst themselves (males fighting males, females fighting females) until the winning pair (usually the largest) remains. If a lone beetle finds a carcass, it can continue alone and wait for a partner. The carcass must be buried by the beetles to get it out of the way of potential competitors, which are numerous. The burial process can take around 8 hours.The male and female pair will move the carcass to a nesting chamber, where they prepare it by removing its hair or feathers. They also coat the carcass with preservatives, which are secretions from their mouth and anus.Burying beetles are nocturnal (active at night). The beetles are strong fliers, moving as far as a kilometer in one night. The nighttime temperature must be above 60\u00b0 F before they can become parents.Burying beetles carry a large numbers of tiny mites on their body. These mites help keep the beetles and their carrion meals free of microbes and fly eggs.",
            "reproduction": "Single males attract mates by releasing a pheromone (a chemical that triggers a natural behavioural response in another member of the same species) from the tip of their abdomens. Pairs usually meet at a carcass to begin mating. Females can raise a brood alone, fertilizing her eggs using sperm stored from previous copulations.Once the carcass is in a nesting chamber, the female burying beetle lays eggs (around 10 to 30 eggs) in the soil around the crypt (a buried carcass). The larvae hatch after a few days and move into a pit in the carcass which the parents have created. Although the larvae are able to feed themselves, both parents also feed the larvae by digesting the flesh and regurgitating liquid food for the larvae to feed on. This can speed up larval development. Burying beetles are unusual among insects in that both the male and female participate in parental care for their young.Several pairs of beetles may cooperate to bury large carcasses and then raise their broods communally. The larvae take several days to mature, and during this time the adults will protect them. Males will even stand in for the female and take on her role if she dies.The final-stage larvae will crawl into the soil to pupate, transforming from small white larvae to fully formed adult beetles. Sexual maturity is reached at 48 to 68 days old, and the life cycle starts again.",
            "location and habitat": "Burying beetles can be found in many different areas of the world. Most species are primarily found in Northern Europe, including the United Kingdom, but can also be found in Asia. The American burying beetle is found in North America, but its population is declining. While it was once found in 35 states, as well as the District of Columbia and three Canadian provinces, it is now only found in Rhode Island, Kansas, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Nebraska.The exact habitat that burying beetles prefer to reside in is actually unknown, but it is thought they might like forests and grasslands. They can also be found in coastal habitats.Burying Beetle Conservation StatusThe beetle population decline is happening all over the world, although only some are considered endangered species. The American burying beetle is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List.The reason for the declining numbers of this beetle are unknown, but it is thought that habitat loss plays a big part, probably caused by climate change. The loss of their natural habitat means they also have to compete with larger animals, such as foxes and opossums, for carcasses.",
            "importance": "Burying beetles are among the many small critters that decompose the bodies of dead animals and, without them, there would be too many carcasses for us to deal with! This also means they help to restrict the spread of any diseases from the corpses. What\u2019s more, as they recycle the carcasses, they ultimately return valuable nutrients to the soil.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

Fossil evidence indicates that the ancestors of modern camels evolved in North America during the Palaeogene period (a period of geologic time that lasting 42 million years and is a time when mammals evolved) and later spread to Asia.",
            "camel characteristics": "Camels are camelids, members of the biological family Camelidae, the only living family in the suborder Tylopoda. Camels tend to be large and are strictly herbivorous. Camels differ from ruminants in several ways.Camels have a three-chambered rather than a four-chambered digestive tract. They have an upper lip that is split in two with each part separately mobile, Camels also have an isolated incisor in the upper jaw. The red blood cells in camels are oval shaped, unlike those of other mammals, which are circular. This is to facilitate their flow in a dehydrated state. These cells are also more stable in order to withstand high osmotic variation (the diffusion of water through a cell wall or membrane) without rupturing when drinking large amounts of water.A fully grown adult camel stands 1.85 metres (6 feet) at the shoulder and 2.15 metres (7 feet) at the hump. Camels can run up to 65 kilometres per hour (40 miles per hour) in short bursts and sustain speeds of up to 40 kilometres per hour (25 miles per hour).The average life span of a camel is 30 to 60 years.The term camel is also used more broadly to describe any of the six camel-like creatures in the family Camelidae. The two true camels and the four South American camelids, Llama, Alpaca, Guanaco and Vicu\u00f1a.Camels are well known for their humps. A camels hump or humps raise about 30 inches out of its body. Camels do not, however, store water in their humps as commonly believed, though they do serve this purpose through roundabout means. Camels humps are a reservoir of fatty tissue, while water is stored in their blood.However, when this tissue is metabolised, it is not only a source of energy, but yields through reaction with oxygen. This allows camels to survive without water for about two weeks and without food for up to a month.The kidneys of a camel are very efficient. Urine comes out as a thick syrup and their faeces are so dry that it can fuel fires.Camels are able to withstand changes in body temperature and water content that would kill most other animals. Their temperature ranges from 34\u00b0C (93\u00b0F) at night up to 41\u00b0C (106\u00b0F) in the day and only above this threshold will they begin to sweat. This allows them to preserve about five litres of water a day. Camels can withstand at least 25% weight loss due to sweating.A feature of their nostrils is that a large amount of water vapour when they exhale is trapped and returned to their body fluids, thereby reducing the amount of water lost through respiration.A camels thick coat reflects sunlight. A shaved camel has to sweat 50% more to avoid overheating. It also insulates them from the intense heat that radiates from hot desert sand. Their long legs help by keeping them further from the hot ground. Camels have tough feet so that they can endure the scorching desert sands. Camels have been known to swim if given the chance.A camels mouth is very sturdy and they are able to chew thorny desert plants. Long eyelashes and ear hairs, together with closeable nostrils, form an effective barrier against sand. Camels pace (moving both legs on one side at the same time) and their widened feet help them move without sinking into the sand.All member species of the Camelids are known to have a highly unusual immune system, where part of the antibody repertoire is composed of immunoglobulins without light chain. Whether and how this contributes to their resistance to harsh environments is currently unknown."

(Note that mixed-sex groups should be avoided as hamsters are lively breeders.) Campbell\u2019s Dwarf Hamsters are crepuscular, meaning that they are most active at dawn and at dusk.Like all hamsters, Campbell\u2019s Dwarf Hamsters are rodents and therefore must gnaw regularly to keep the incisors from growing into the skin of the mouth and causing health problems. Some pet owners may provide dog biscuits to assist with this. Wooden chew toys should be used with care as splinters may injure the hamster.",

            "advice for pet owners of the campbell\u2019s hamster:": "Campbell\u2019s Dwarf Hamsters have extremely poor eyesight and even worse depth perception. Cataracts are also common in older hamsters. To compensate for this disability, Campbell\u2019s have many scent glands, which are located on the face, behind the ears, on the cheek pouches and near the rectum and genitals.Many pet owners observe that the hamster may groom itself when in an unfamiliar location. This is done to scent the feet, creating a trail which would enable the hamster to find its way back to the burrow. This behaviour may also be used to revisit a location with plentiful food. These scent trails may persist for up to eight days.In addition to diabetes, hamsters can develop tumours (both benign and malignant), as well as glaucoma. It is possible to remove benign and malignant tumours with surgery. Unfortunately, there is not much one can do about glaucoma, as the eye will eventually prolapse.",
            "colours and markings of the campbell\u2019s hamster": "Campbell\u2019s Dwarf Hamsters are born with one of two coat types, satin and rex. A hamster with a satin coat appears wet or greasy. In reality the gene only enhances the furs color and gives it lift. The rex coat type is sleek, smooth and glossy and is found in the vast majority of hamsters.Campbell\u2019s Dwarf Hamsters are available in three basic colors plus many variations thereof. There is also a mottled gene that can result in different markings.Basic Colours include:agouti (the normal wild color)argente (cinnamon or sandy)albino (white)Not all white hamsters with red/pink eyes are albino. Some are so heavily mottled or tinged with platinum that they will appear to be white. Furthermore, when two mottled hamsters are bred, approximately 25% of the litter will be anopthalmic whites, lacking eyes and teeth. This lethal mutation is the product of the interaction between already-mutated genes. These pups generally do not live past two months.Marking types include:mottled (also called banded, spotted, or collared, if the mottling is confined to the neck)platinum (sometimes called pearl)Interbreeding has produced new colors, including blue, blue fawn, lilac fawn and black. Contrary to popular belief, the different colors and markings of hamsters do not indicate personality differences. Personality can be predicted, though, by a close examination of the bloodline and any neurological diseases its ancestors displayed."

These foxes are sometimes called the Arctic Marbled Fox, or just the Marbled Fox. As the name suggests, it is \u2018native\u2019 to Canada and the parent breeds are found in the northern and western parts of the country. It is a small hybrid from the Red Fox and the Arctic Fox or Silver Fox. The Fur Commission in the USA suggests that the first litter of marble foxes occurred with a silver\u00a0fox\u00a0litter in\u00a01945 in Norway. As most silver foxes live in the Canadian Arctic, this is where the cross breeding of the two species normally occurs. They were not bred to be a domesticated species as such, they are still very much a wild animal. All be it a very cute one.",
            "live?": "These foxes are not naturally occurring. They are bred artificially and as the arctic/silver fox parent comes mostly from Arctic regions of Northern Canada, it is known as the Canadian marbled fox. There are reports of some of these foxes living now living in the wild but most are bred and kept in captivity. There are many known breeders around the USA and Canada.Wild individuals have no advantages over their parent breeds, other than perhaps a thicker coat.

However, foxes are classed as wild or exotic pets and most states in the USA have a comprehensive blanket ban on keeping these animals as pets. In total, it is illegal in 35 states of the USA to own a fox as a pet, legal in only 15. In the states where it may be legal, you might still need a permit or a licence to keep the animal as a pet.In Arkansas for example, you are able to keep any fox as a pet, but in others you would only get a permit for a fennec fox, not a red fox. As the marbled fox is a hybrid from the red, you would not get a licence. So even in states where you might think it is legal, it is best to check thoroughly.States Where You Can Keep Any Fox As A Pet:ArkansasFloridaMichiganMissouriNebraskaNorth DakotaSouth DakotaOhioOklahomaTennesseeStates Where Permit Is Required:IndianaKentucky (permissible only if obtained in-state)New York (fennec fox only)North CarolinaWyoming (red fox, gray fox, swift fox only)Utah (red fox only)In CanadaIn many parts of Canada it is illegal to keep a fox as a pet.

Cape Gannets resemble the Northern Gannets apart from the fact that the Northern Gannet is entirely white except for black wing tips. The Cape Gannet total breeding population is around 150,000 birds, with 12% in Namibia, although numbers have declined on the Nambian Islands over the last fifty years, and 88% in South Africa. The largest colony of this large seabird is found on Malgas Island, South Africa. The non-breeding range of Cape Gannets extends from the coastal waters off the Gulf of Guinea on the west coast of Africa, to Mozambique on the east coast. Cape Gannets seldom occur farther offshore than 100 kilometres, though records of birds more than 200 kilometres offshore exist for both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.",
            "cape gannet characteristics": "Cape Gannets can grow to be 33 \u2013 37 inches (84 \u2013 94 centimetres) in length and weigh around 5.7 pounds (2,600 grams). They have a wide wingspan which can measure 68 \u2013 73 inches (171 \u2013 185 centimetres).Cape Gannets have a white plumage with black tails and black wing edges and wing tips. Their crowns and hind necks are yellow in color and they have distinctive black line markings around their eyes and beak. Their bills (beaks) are pointed and are pale blue in color. These snow-white seabirds have fine serrations close to the tip of their bills which help them catch fish and because they enter the water with such force, they have no external nostrils in which water could be forced into.When diving for fish, these large sea birds can hit the water at speeds of around 40 \u2013 120 kilometres per hour.At first glance, it would be easy to mistake the Cape Gannet with the Galapagos Masked Booby Bird as they are quite similar in appearance with the black lines around the eyes and beak base not being so defined in the Booby Bird.",
            "cape gannet habitat": "The Cape Gannet is strictly a marine bird. Within its normal range Cape Gannets are restricted to the continental shelf, at no more than 100 kilometres from the coast. Occasionally these large seabirds have been recorded on oceanic waters.",
            "cape gannet diet": "Cape Gannets are fish eating birds like most seabirds, that plunge and dive from great heights into the ocean and grab their prey. They favour sardines and other shoaling pelagic fish such as Pilchards. They eat around 300 grams of fish per day.",
            "cape gannet behaviour": "Cape Gannets are very powerful fliers who glide the air thermals frequently flapping to accelarate their flight. This technique of flap-gliding is a more energy consuming flying technique than the other dynamic souring that is used by other large seabirds, such as the Albatross. Cape Gannets are generally quiet at sea, however, when in colonies they will emit a rasping call \u2018arrag arrah\u2019.Cape Gannets are not strictly migratory birds and the majority will remain within 500 kilometres of their breeding site year round, with the possibility of some adult male Gannets continuing to use the breeding grounds as roosting sites throughout the non-breeding season.Cape Gannets breed on only 6 islands off the coast of Nambia and South Africa.Nambia, SA \u2013 Mercury Island, Ichaboe Island and Possession Island.South Africa \u2013 Bird Island (Lambert\u2019s Bay), Bird Island (Algoa Bay) and Malgas Island.Cape Gannets nest in large, dense colonies on flat or sloping islands.",
            "cape gannet reproduction": "The Cape Gannet breeding season begins around August/September time and can last until the next April. Like most Gannets, males and females stay together over several breeding seasons. They build their nests out of droppings, with a few bones and feathers mixed in and other vegetation. Where matierials are scarce, eggs will be laid on bare ground.Elaborate mating riturals are preformed at the nest whereby both male and female stretch their necks towards the sky and tap their bills together.The female Cape Gannet typically lays a single egg around October, which is pale blue in color which quickly becomes coated in brown guano. Both the male and female share incubation of the egg which lasts around 40 \u2013 46 days.Cape Gannets use their webbed feet in the incubation process whereby the foot webs are wrapped around the egg surrounding it with the heat from the rich blood vessels.When born, the hatchling is a dark, mottled color, blind, has no feathers and its beak is pale. The hatchling is very small and only weighs around 70 grams. It takes around three weeks for the juvenile to reach a third of the size of an adult Gannet which is quite a rapid growth.At around eight weeks, the chick will weigh more than the adult Gannet and will remain this way until it becomes a fledgling at the age of 97 days old. The chick is cared for by both parents until this time and then it is able to go out to sea to forage for itself.The life span of a Cape Gannet is around 17 years.",
            "cape gannet conservation status": "The Cape Gannet is listed a \u2018Vulnerable\u2019 as numbers have declined due to its small breeding range. Over exploitation of its prey by human fisheries, compounded by pollution, is causing a continuous decline in the quality of surrounding waters for foraging. The collaspe of the Nambian Sardine Fishery has been a main decline of the Nambian Gannet populations. Anchovies only temporarily and partially replace sardines in their diet when the latter becomes scarce.Other threats include predators such as the Great White Pelican who is a significant threat to Gannet chicks.",

            "bird diet": "The Capercaillie is a herbivore and lives on a variety of foods including buds, leaves, berries, insects, grasses and in the winter mostly conifer needles. You can see the food remains in their droppings, which are about 1 centimetre in diameter and 5 \u2013 6 centimetres in length. Most of the year the droppings are of solid consistency, but with the ripening of blueberries, these dominate the diet and the faeces become formless and bluish-black.During winter, when a high snow cover prevents access to ground vegetation, the Capercaillie spends almost day and night on trees, feeding on coniferous needles of spruce, pine and fir as well as on buds from beech and rowan trees.Many numbers of surviving Capercaillies decline even under massive efforts to breed them in captivity and release them into the wild. The most serious threats to the species are habitat degradation, particularly conversion of diverse native forest into often single-species timber plantations, and to birds colliding with fences erected to keep deer out of young plantations. Increased numbers of small predators (e.g. Red Fox) due to the loss of large predators (e.g. Wolf, Brown Bear) also cause problems in some areas. In some areas, declines are due to excessive hunting, though game laws in many areas have stopped this. It has not been hunted in Scotland and Germany for over 30 years.\u00a0"

It belongs to the family Caviidae and the class Mammalia. The capybaras lives in savannas, forests, rivers, swamps and marshes \u2014 wherever there is sufficient water for them to drink and enough food for them to feed on. They are a very social species and can live in groups of up to 100 individuals. The capybaras common name means \u2018Master of the Grasses\u2019 while its scientific name, \u2018hydrochaeris\u2019, is Greek for \u2018water hog.",
            "characteristics": "Capybaras are the world\u2019s largest rodent. They grow to 130 centimetres (4.3 feet) and 50 centimetres (1.6 feet) tall, weighing up to 65 kilograms (140 pounds). They have webbed toes which enables them to be excellent swimmers. They can survive completely underwater for up to five minutes, an ability they use to evade predators.Capybaras have heavy, barrel-shaped bodies and short heads with reddish-brown fur on the upper part of their body that turns yellowish-brown underneath. They lack down hair, and their guard hair differs little from over hair.Capybaras have slightly webbed feet and no tail. Their back legs are slightly longer than their front legs and their muzzles are blunt with eyes, nostrils and ears on top of their head. They have 20 teeth. Female capybaras are slightly heavier than males.Like other rodents, the front teeth of capybaras grow continually to compensate for the constant wearing-down from eating grasses. Their cheek teeth also grow continuously. When fully grown, they will have coarse hair that is sparsely spread over their skin, making the capybara prone to sunburn. To prevent this, they may roll in mud to protect their skin from the sun.Capybaras have an extremely efficient digestive system that sustains the animal while 75% of its diet encompasses only 3 to 6 species of plants. They\u00a0have two types of scent glands; a morrillo, located on the snout, and anal glands. While both sexes have these glands, males have much larger morrillos and use their anal glands more frequently. Male anal glands are also lined with hairs.\u00a0",
            "lifespan": "The Capybara can live for between 8 and 10 years, but they often do not live over four years old because of predation in the wild. They are a favourite food of anacondas, jaguar, puma, ocelot, eagle and caiman. They may live for 12 years in captivity.",
            "diet": "Capybaras are herbivores (more specifically, a graminivore \u2013 a herbivorous animal that feeds primarily on plants of the family Poaceae). They graze mainly on grasses, water plants and aquatic plants, as well as fruit and tree bark. They are selective with their feeding and around 75% of their diet involves between three and six different species of plant. However, they eat a greater variety of plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available. Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, so they are not consumed at that time.An adult capybara will eat 6 to 8 pounds (2.7 to 3.6 kilograms) of grasses per day. The Capybaras jaw hinge is non-perpendicular and they therefore chew food by grinding back and forth rather than side-to-side, which helps them to chew through tough plant materials.Capybaras are coprophagous, meaning they eat their own faeces as a source of bacterial gut flora and in order to help digest the cellulose in the grass that forms their normal diet and extract the maximum protein from their food. Additionally, they may regurgitate food to masticate (chew) the food again, similar to how a cow chews the cud. They do not follow the same route while grazing on consecutive days.Just like the guinea pig, these rodents d not have the capacity to synthesize vitamin C.\u00a0",
            "location and habitat": "Capybaras are semi-aquatic mammals found wild in much of South America (including Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, French Guyana, Uruguay, Peru and Paraguay) in dense rainforest areas near bodies of water. They live near lakes, rivers, swamps, streams, ponds and marshes, such as flooded savannah and along rivers in tropical forest. They roam in home ranges of 25 to 50 acres.\u00a0",
            "behaviour": "Capybaras are social animals, usually found in groups of between 10 and 30 (though looser groups of up to 100 can be formed). The groups are controlled by a dominant male who will have a prominent scent gland on his nose used for smearing his scent on the grass in his territory. Capybaras communicate through a combination of scent and sound, being very vocal animals with purrs and alarm barks, whistles and clicks, squeals and grunts.As well as using scent glands, they can spread their scent further by urinating. Females usually mark without urinating and scent-mark less frequently than males overall. Females mark more often during the wet season when they are in estrus. In addition to objects, males also scent-mark females.During midday, as temperatures increase, capybaras wallow in water to keep cool and then graze in late afternoons and early evenings. Capybaras sleep very little, usually napping throughout the day and grazing into and through the night.Capybaras are agile on land, but they are also very at home in the water. They never stray far from water as when one senses danger it gives a short bark that encourages the herd to quickly scuttle into the water to hide. They are so well adapted to going unseen in the water that they are actually able to hold their breath for up to five minutes after diving in. They are also able to sleep in the water, keeping only their noses out.\u00a0",
            "reproduction": "Capybaras reach sexual maturity within 18 months and breed when conditions are right, which can be once per year (in Brazil) or throughout the year (in Venezuela and Colombia). When in estrus, the female\u2019s scent changes subtly and nearby males begin pursuit. A female will also alert males she is in estrus by whistling through her nose.The male pursues a female and mounts when the female is still in the water. The capybara gestation period is 130 \u2013 150 days and the female usually produces a litter of four capybara babies, but may produce between two and eight in a single litter.Birth takes place on land and the female will rejoin the group within a few hours of delivering the newborn. Capybara young are very well developed at birth and not only have all their fur and can see, but are also able to run, swim and dive within hours of birth.The newborns will join the group as soon as they become mobile. Within a week, the young can eat grass, but will continue to suckle from any female in the group, until weaned at about 16 weeks. Youngsters will form a group within the main group. The rainy season of April and May mark the peak breeding season.\u00a0Capybara Conservation StatusCapybaras are not on the IUCN red list and so are not considered a threatened species. Their population is stable through most of their South American ranges, though in some areas hunting has reduced their numbers.They are hunted for their meat and pelts in some areas and otherwise killed by humans who see their grazing as competition for livestock.Their skins are particularly prized for making fine gloves because of its odd characteristic, it stretches in just one direction. In some areas they are farmed, which has the effect of insuring that the wetland habitats are protected. Their survival is aided by their ability to breed rapidly.\u00a0",
            "s and humans": "Capybaras are residents of many parks and zoos, and can live for up to 12 years in these areas, which is double their lifespan in the wild.They are gentle and will usually allow humans to pet and hand-feed them. However, this is often discouraged because of their ticks which can be vectors to Rocky Mountain spotted fever.Although it is illegal in some states, capybaras are occasionally kept as pets in the United States.\u00a0",
            "predators": "The biggest predators of the capybara are the green anaconda, jaguars, pumas, ocelots, eagles, and caimans. They are also hunted by humans for both its meat and hide.\u00a0FAQsWhat is a capybara?A capybara is a giant cavy rodent native to South America. It is the largest living rodent and is a close relative of the guinea pig. They are highly social and can be found in groups as large as 100 individuals. It lives in savannas and dense forests, near bodies of water.What do capybaras eat?Capybaras are herbivores and eat mainly grasses and aquatic plants, as well as fruit and tree bark. They are very selective feeders, although will eat a variety of plants during the dry season when there are less plants available. They eat grass during the wet season, but must switch to more abundant reeds and grains, melons, and squashes during the dry season.A capybara can eat 6 to 8 pounds (2.7 to 3.6 kilograms) of grass per day. They also eat their own feces to get beneficial bacteria to help their stomach break down the thick fiber in their meals.They regurgitate their food and chew it some more, like ruminants like goats, cows, and giraffes. They chew their food from side to side like a camel, rather than up and down, which helps them to chew the tough plant materials.Where do capybaras live?Capybaras are found in Panama, Colombia, Venezuela and Peru, down through Brazil and Paraguay and into northern Argentina and Uruguay. They live in swamps, marshes, rivers and lakes, but can also be found in grassy plains and even in rainforests.In the dry season they need to live in an area where there is water and they are able to feed, and in the wet season when the area floods they must still be able to graze, which they often do on the grassy banks.How long does a capybara live?They can have a lifespan of between 8 and 10 years, but often in the wild they only live to around four years old. This is because they are preyed on, especially by animals such as the green anaconda, jaguars, pumas, ocelots, eagles, and caimans.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "desc": "The Caracal (Caracal caracal) is a medium sized wild cat that is native to Africa, Central Asia, the Middle East, northwestern India and arid areas of Pakistan. Belonging to the family Felidae and the order Carnivora, there are three subspecies of caracal recognized. These cats are characterized by their black tufted ears, their strong build, short face and long legs, and their reddish or sand-colored fur helps to camouflage them against their environment. The caracal is an opportunistic hunter and will hunt whatever it can find, preying mainly on small mammals. The caracal cat is a nocturnal animal and therefore quite difficult to observe. For this reason, the exact population of the caracal is unknown, but it is thought that these cats are not endangered. Keep reading on to find out more interesting caracal facts. Although the caracal is considered a small cat compared to other wild cats, it is among the heaviest and fastest.",
            "cat": "The caracal cat belongs to the Felidae family and is a member of the Mammalia class. Caracal is its common name, while it\u2019s scientific name is Felis caracal. The name caracal is derived from a Turkish word \u201ckarakulak\u201d meaning \u201cblack ear\u201d. The caracal is also known as desert lynx and Persian lynx.The three subspecies of caracal are the southern caracal, the northern caracal and the Asiatic caracal. The southern caracal is found in Southern and East Africa, the northern caracal is found in North and West Africa and the Asiatic caracal is found in Asia.Caracals were first scientifically described by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1776, who described a caracal skin from the Cape of Good Hope. John Edward Gray placed it in the genus Caracal in 1843.These cats were used by rulers in India to hunt small game up until the 20th century, and also have religious importance in ancient Egypt; they occur as bronze figurines which are thought to have been guards of the tombs of pharaohs. Chinese emperors also used to give caracals as gifts.CharacteristicsCaracals are medium sized cats with slender bodies. Male caracals usually measure between 78 and 108 cm (31 and 43 in) long and have a tail between 21 and 34 cm (8.3 and13.4 in) long, and weigh between 7.2 and 19 kg (16 and 42 lbs). Female caracals have a length of between 71 and 102.9 cm (28.0 and 40.5 in) with a tail of 18 to 31.5 cm (7.1 to 12.4 in), and weigh between 7 and 15.9 kg (15 and 35 lbs). The caracal is sexually dimorphic, and the females are smaller than the males in almost every way.They have a strong build and a short face, with long hind legs that are longer than the forelegs, so the body appears to be sloping downward from the rump. Their most prominent feature is their black tufted ears, which can measure 4.5 cm, with the tufts beginning to droop as the animal ages. Their long ears contains 20 muscles, meaning they are extremely sensitive and great at helping them to track down prey. They have other black markings on their body \u2014 two black stripes from the forehead to the nose and a black outline of the mouth. There are also white patches surrounding their eyes and mouth.Caracals are often referred to as the desert lynx, but they do not actually possess the same physical attributes as members of the lynx family, such as the characteristic ruff of hair around the face or a spotted or blotched coat. Instead, their coat is short and dense and is uniformly reddish tan or sandy, though black caracals are also known. Their underbelly and the insides of their legs are lighter, often with small reddish markings. While their coat is mostly soft, it can grow coarser in the summer.The caracal has a total of 30 teeth, with canines that are up to 2 cm (0.8 in) long and sharp. They also have a tan, bushy tail that measures about 8 to 13 inches long and extends to the hocks, which helps them to turn and stay on course when chasing prey. Their sharp claws help them to grab onto trees and climb up into branches, and also help them to catch prey.Caracals are closely related to servals and are about the same size, but live in different places. Servals like to hunt in humid, wet areas while caracals stay in dry, desert environments.",
            "lifespan": "In the wild, the average lifespan of a caracal is 12 years old. However, in captivity, caracals have been known to live to up to 19 years old. This is because, when kept in zoos, they are not threatened by predators, get medical attention, and do not have to hunt for food.",
            "diet": "Caracals are carnivores and prey on a variety of different mammals. The most common animals they prey on are rodents, hares, hyraxes, antelope, rabbits, birds, snakes and lizards. Unlike the other small African cats, Caracals will not hesitate to kill prey larger than themselves, such as young kudu, bushbuck, impala, mountain reedbuck and springbok. Caracals will even venture on farmer\u2019s land to prey on livestock such as sheep and goats.A caracal can leap higher than 4 metres (12 ft) and catch birds in midair, and can even twist and change its direction midair. To capture its prey, it stalks the animal until it is within 5 m (16 ft) of it, after which it runs it down and kills its animal with a bite to the throat or to the back of the neck.They do not like to eat the wiry hair on animals they catch and will use their claws to remove it. They will eat feathers though, and will even eat rotten meat if they are really hungry.",
            "behavior": "Caracals live alone most of the time, although they can live in pairs. As a nocturnal animal, they are highly secretive and difficult to observe. They are usually most active when the temperature drops below 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F). Sometimes these cats can cover as many as 12 miles as they search their territory for prey. When needed, they can run at a speed of 50 mph.Caracals can be vocal, purring when content and also making a variety of other noises, including meows, hisses, growls, and spits. They are aggressive cats and are quick to defend their territory from other animals. To warn other caracals that they are invading their territory, they will sharpen their claws on trees as a visual way to let others know the area is occupied. They also release scent from between their toes to protect their area, and marks rocks and vegetation in its territory with urine. Some have even theorized that the reason for their long ears is so that they can communicate with each other.",
            "reproduction": "Caracals live a solitary life until they are ready to mate. Breeding takes place throughout the year and females go into oestrus every two weeks, unless they are pregnant. They show a spike in urine-marking and form temporary pairs with males when in oestrus.The gestation period of a caracal is about two to three months, after which a litter of between one and six babies are born. Two is the average. A caracal young is called a kitten and each weighs about 7 to 9 ounces at birth. They are usually born in dense vegetation or deserted burrows of aardvarks and porcupines, and are born with their eyes shut, which will open at around 10 days old. They claws are not retractable at birth, and their ears are also closed. Their ears become erect and their claws retract between three and four weeks of age.Caracal kittens begin to eat solid food at around the fifth or sixth week, and their milk teeth appear by the time they are 50 days old. At around nine to ten months old, a caracal will leave its mother. However, a few females stay back with their mothers.A caracal is sexually mature by the time they are a year old, even though the production of gametes begins between 7 to 10 months old. Successful mating only occurs after 12 to 15 months.Location and HabitatCaracals mostly live in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as parts of the middle East. They are well adapted to dry areas, and live in savannas, woodlands and mountains. In the Asian regions, they are found in forests and seldom live in tropical or desert environments. Fortunately, they do not need a lot of water to survive, and get most of their fluids form the animals that they kill and eat. They are well adapted to the hot weather and sleep during the hottest hours of the day and are most active at night.Caracals sleep in burrows, rock crevices, bushes and even branches of a tree. Their body and their feet are designed to allow them to move and walk on hot sand. They move very quietly and blend in well to their environment to avoid being preyed on.Conservation StatusThe caracal is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, but exact caracal population numbers are unknown. Hunting of caracals is prohibited in Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Morocco, Pakistan, Syria, Tajikistan, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.They are tolerant of humans, but would not make a good pet! That being said, some people do keep caracals as pets, and it has been said they can be domesticated if raised with humans from a very young age.",
            "threats": "The two main predators of caracals are lions and hyenas, as they inhabit the same area as caracals. Humans are also a threat to caracals, especially if they wander onto farmland. In parts of South Africa and Namibia, most landowners are allowed to kill caracals on sight if they are considered to be a threat to them or their property.Habitat loss is another threat for these animals. Agricultural expansion and the building of roads threatens the caracals environment, and they are often killed in road accidents in Turkey and Iran. Additionally, they are threatened by hunting for the pet trade on the Arabian Peninsula."

            "desc": "The Caribou is a wild species of deer often called reindeer when domesticated. They belong to a large group of hoofed ungulate mammals called artiodactyls which also includes camels and giraffes. They are found in the arctic tundra regions of North America, Asia, Northern Europe, Alaska and Greenland. Caribou can also be seen in sub arctic boreal forests during migration where they take refuge in windy coastal areas from flies and mosquitoes.",
            "caribou description": "The caribou is well adapted to its environment. Caribous are large even toed mammals that measure 1.2 \u2013 2.2 metres (4 \u2013 7.25 feet) in length and stand 1.2 \u2013 1.5 metres (4 \u2013 5 foot at shoulder height. They can weigh between 60 \u2013 318 kilograms (130 \u2013 700 pounds). Their coats are short, thick and colored brown in summer turning grey in the winter. Their rumps and chests are white and they have blunt, hair-covered muzzles and short tails.Caribous have long legs and wide, flat hooves which act like snowshoes helping them walk on snow and soft ground. Caribou hooves are hollow underneath which enables them to dig snow when searching for food.Caribous are the only deer species where both male and female have antlers but some females have no antlers. Males have larger and more branched out antlers than females which can extend in size to over 1 metre (3.25 feet). Their antlers grow directly from their skulls and are covered with a thin skin called a \u2018velvet\u2019. During the \u2018rutting\u2019 season, the velvet on the males antlers disappear.Males use their antlers to fight each other for access to females. Male antlers fall off after the mating season has finished and females lose their antlers during the birthing season. When a caribous antler is broken between April and August when in the \u2018velvet\u2019 stage, it loses blood flow to the antler and velvet.Caribou have 2 circulation systems in their bodies. The circulation through the legs is up to 50 degrees colder than the circulation system for the rest of their body. Caribous have hollow hairs rooted in a thick layer of fat also to conserve heat during freezing temperatures.",
            "caribou habitat": "Caribou habitats include arctic tundra regions, sub arctic boreal forests and mountainous habitats.",
            "caribou diet": "Caribous are herbivores and their preferred diet is tundra plant matter including leaves, twigs, moss and lichen known as reindeer moss. When food is abundant, an adult caribou can eat as much as 5 \u2013 6 kilograms of food per day. When the caribou eats, the food goes down to the caribous first stomach, where it is mashed into small pieces called cud and stored to eat at the caribous next meal. Because caribous can eat large quantities of food they increase their internal heat production to prevent them from freezing in extreme weather conditions.",
            "caribou behaviour": "Caribou undertake one of the most grueling animal migrations of any other terrestrial mammal. Herds of thousands of animals complete a round migration journey of over 5,000 kilometres (3,100 miles) visiting spring calving areas and summer and winter feeding grounds. During migration, herds of cows (female caribou) leave several weeks before the males, who follow with yearling calves from the previous birthing season.Caribous move from region to region, forced on by seasonal availability of tundra plants on which they feed. Caribou frequently cross rivers and lakes during their migration travels. They are very strong swimmers using their wide hooves as paddles and their thick, air-filled coats help them stay buoyant and warm when swimming through the icy waters. In winter months, caribou move to sub arctic boreal forests where the snow covering is less than on open tundra. Here, they can use their wide hooves to dig and graze on the lichen beneath the snow.Caribou herds can run very fast reaching speeds of 50 miles per hour while migrating. Herds of caribou tend to be larger during spring migration and smaller during autumn when mating occurs.Male caribous fight during rutting season which can result in serious injuries such as cuts and bruises. The worst that can happen is that their antlers can lock together and caribou who cannot unlock their horns will starve.Caribou are generally quiet animals, however, they may emit a loud snort. Herds of snorting caribou may sound like a group of pigs. Groups of cows and new born calves are particularly vocal as they constantly communicate with each other.Caribou predators include wolves, grizzly and black bears, cougars, wolverines, lynx, coyotes and golden eagles.",
            "caribou reproduction": "Mating season occurs in autumn as aforementioned. Males fight for access to females. Two males will lock their antlers together and try to push each other away. The most dominant males can collect as many as 15 \u2013 20 females to mate with. A male will stop eating during this time and lose much of its body reserves.Births take place in May or June the following year on inland calving grounds after a gestation period of 45 days. One calf is born each year with twins being rare.Baby deer calves can run shortly after birth, however, large numbers succumb to predators, in particular, Grey Wolves who track down the migrating herds and stalk the birthing grounds looking for easy prey. The young are able to graze and forage but continue suckling until the following autumn and become independent from their mothers. Caribou become sexually mature at between 1.5 and 3.5 years of age. The life span of a caribou is around 15 years in the wild.",
            "caribou conservation status": "Despite their large numbers, caribous are an endangered species. The caribou has a very warm very soft fur that is hollow, insulated and sheds water and snow. This valuable fur was traded for a lot of money in the 1800\u2019s. The caribou population decreased because of over hunting until laws were passed to protect it.Caribou are susceptible to and recover slowly from population declines because of their low rate of reproduction. The main factors leading to caribou declines are habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation, as well as predation. Loss of caribou habitat, which is permanent, occurs when forest is cleared for agriculture. Habitat degradation means a reduction in the amount or quality of caribou habitat, as happens following such events as wildfires or timber harvesting, or through human disturbance."

Interestingly enough, the cat family split from the other mammals at least 40,000,000 years ago, making them one of the oldest mammalian families. All cats share certain characteristics that are unique to the cat family. Adult cats average about 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 centimetres) tall at the shoulder. Most cats weigh from 6 to 15 pounds (2.7 to 7 kilograms). Some cats weigh more than 20 pounds (9 kilograms).",
            "cat diet": "Cats are pure carnivores (meat-eaters) and require a lot of meat and a lot of protein in their diet, usually around 30%. Cats tend not to eat fruit and vegetables as they do not have an adequate digestive system to cope with that kind of food, although they occassionally chew grass to help with digestion. A good well-balanced diet is essential for your cats health. There is a wide range of cat foods available:Canned Food: Canned cat foods are the most popular and contain all the necessary nutrients, vitamins and minerals. Most canned food comes in a variety of flavours, including, chicken, rabbit lamb, turkey, liver, salmon, tuna, cod and game. Canned foods are available in both gravy and jelly varieties.Foil pouches and alu-trays: Single serve packaging such as 100 gram foil pouches and alu-trays have become popular with cat owners due to their convenience and cost. Most cats will only eat 100 grams of food in one serving resulting in a lot of wastage when using the 400 gram canned food. Foil pouches come in many delicious flavours including duck, turkey, lamb, liver, chicken and rabbit. Gravy and jelly varieties are also available in foil pouches.Dried Food: Dried cat food is becoming increasingly popular. It contains all the vitamin and minerals necessary for a complete balanced diet. Water should always be available when feeding your cat dry food. Dry food can always be mixed with food in gravy for extra nutrients.Treats: Treats can provide an extra supplement to your cats diet and provide exercise for cats teeth and gums.Fresh Food: Fresh food can provide an extra source of nutrition. Cooked meat such as beef, lamb, turkey or chicken should be cooled before serving.Dry food helps to clean the teeth and if nutritionally complete can be the bulk of the cats diet and it is easily stored. Although it must be refrigerated once opened, most cats enjoy the variety. Cats prefer their food at room temperature. Never feed your cat food that comes directly from the refrigerator. It is a good idea to take food out of the fridge around half an hour before serving to enable it to climatize to room temperature. Many cats cannot digest milk and develop diarrhoea when given cows milk. This can be particularly serious for kittens who become quickly dehydrated when suffering from diarrhoea. Cat milk is available in small plastic bottles. Always provide clean fresh water for your cat.",
            "how much to feed your cat": "Do not fill their plate. If you cannot feel your cats ribs, it is probably overweight and daily rations should be reduced. If you think you are feeding your cat adequate amounts of food, but it looks thin or loses weight, have it examined by a veterinarian. Loving owners often indulge their pets into obesity. Overweight pets have shorter life spans and are more prone to heart and respiratory problems and arthritic pain. Help your cat stay healthy by keeping it at its proper weight.It\u2019s important to keep an eye on this as cat behaviour varies greatly around food. Some will only eat when hungry, while others will eat if there is anything on their plate.\u00a0A kittens diet will be different from that of an adult and elderly cat. Generally a kitten should be fed little and often, whereas, an adult cat will need larger meals less frequently.Cats will kill and eat small mammals, birds, fish, frogs, lizards and snakes. On farms, cats help reduce the vermin population (rats, mice, and other small, destructive animals). Cats use their acute sight and hearing to catch prey. Cats swallow large bites of meat without chewing it. Cats are primarily nocturnal (most active at night) because of their very good night vision.If your cat is unfortunate enough to have a flea problem, visit our Flea section HERE!\u00a0"

            "desc": "Centipedes Centipedes (Class Chilopoda) are fast-moving, venomous, predatory, terrestrial arthropods that have long bodies and many jointed legs. Centipedes are found primarily in tropical climates, however, they are also widely distributed in temperate zones. Despite their name \u2018centipede\u2019 (which means \u2018100 legs\u2019), all centipedes do not have 100 legs. Centipedes are invertebrates meaning \u2018without a backbone or spinal column\u2019. Centipedes have a hard exoskeleton and jointed legs. Like the millipedes, centipedes are highly segmented (15 to 177 segments), but with only one pair of walking legs per segment (millipedes have two legs per segment).",
            "characteristics": "Centipedes have a hard exoskeleton and jointed legs.Like the millipedes, centipedes are highly segmented (15 to 177 segments), but with only one pair of walking legs per segment (millipedes have two legs per segment).The head of a centipede has a pair of antennae, jaw-like mandibles (called forcipules) and other mouthparts. The most anterior trunk segment of a centipede has a pair of venomous claws (called maxillipedes) that are used for both defence and for capturing and paralyzing prey. The bite of a smaller centipede in temperate areas may be similar to a bee sting, but the bite of a larger tropical species is excruciatingly painful, leaving two black puncture wounds as much as a centimetre apart.A common centipede is the house centipede (Scutigera forceps), which is about 5 centimetres (2 inches) long and has 15 pairs of legs. Some centipedes glow in the dark (like the Geophilus electricus).About 20 families and 3,000 species of centipedes have been discovered worldwide.Centipede colors vary from pale yellow through to deep brown. Their bodies are always dorso-ventrally flattened. Although, like all arthropods, centipedes are covered with a tough outer coat, however they do not have a waterproof layer and stay in moist areas where there is no danger of drying up.",
            "habitat": "Many centipedes live in the soil and leaf litter, while those that hunt freely on the ground are strictly nocturnal and spend the day hiding under logs and stones where they can keep moist. They live on land in moist microhabitats (under rocks and logs, in leaf debris, or occasionally in burrows).",
            "predators": "Centipedes come under attack from various other animals such as birds, toads and shrews as well as humans, if they are accidentally trodden on. (Some people also eat centipedes).",
            "s": "There are some rather fierce centipedes living on the planet such as the \u2018Giant Redheaded Centipede\u2019. They are fast moving and very aggressive. They are about 6 inches long but some can be 8 inches long. They can be found in the rocky woodlands in Arkansas and other southern parts of America. (Fortunately, not in the UK).Unfortunately, these aggressive centipedes can be rather dangerous. It was once witnessed in the 1920\u2019s, an officer being injected by a centipede with poisonous venom from one of these \u2018Redheaded Centipedes\u2019 and actually dying after developing an infection. It is hard to believe that these little crawly things that resemble the innocent caterpillar can bite.It is very rare to be bitten by centipedes and like most animals, will only bite in self defence. However, if you are bitten by a centipede, the following procedure may be of help:Place some ice wrapped in a small towell or other suitable cloth on the site of the bite for 10 minutes and then take it off for 10 minutes. Repeat this process. If the patient has circulatory problems, decrease the time to prevent possible damage to the skin.Before Calling Emergency Services:Determine the following information:* the patients age, weight and health condition * the identity of the centipede if possible * the time of the bite",
            "diet": "Centipedes are carnivores (meat-eaters), they use venom to kill their prey. The venom comes from glands that open near the first pair of modified legs (which act as poisonous fangs). Their bite can be painful to a human but not lethal in general.Centipedes eat insects, earthworms, spiders, slugs and other small animals.The largest species of centipede is \u2018Scolopendra gigantea\u2019 which can grow to be about 12 inches long and 1 inch wide and is found in Central America.",
            "reproduction": "Male centipedes spin a small web onto which they deposit a spermatophore (a capsule or mass created by males of various invertebrate species, containing spermatozoa) for the female to take up. Sometimes there is a courtship dance and sometimes the males just leave them for the female centipedes to find. In temperate areas egg laying occurs in spring and summer but in subtropical and tropical areas there appears to be little seasonality to centipede breeding.The Lithobiomorpha, and Scutigeromorpha species lay their eggs singly in holes in the soil, the female fills the hole in on the egg and leaves it. The young usually hatch with only 7 pairs of legs and gain the rest in successive molts. Scutigera coleoptera, the American house centipede, hatches with only 4 pairs of legs and has successive molts before becoming a mature adult. It takes about 3 years for some species to achieve adulthood, however, like millipedes, centipedes are relatively long-lived when compared to their insect cousins. Some can live for 5 or 6 years.Other centipede female species show far more parental care, the eggs 15 to 60 in number are laid in a nest in the soil or in rotten wood, the female stays with the eggs, guarding and licking them to protect them from fungi. The female in some species stays with the young after they have hatched, guarding them until they are ready to leave. If disturbed the females tend to either abandon the eggs or young or to eat them."

            "desc": "The Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is the fastest terrestrial animal in the world and is a unique member of the cat family \u2018felidae\u2019. The scientific name for a Cheetah is Acinonyx jubatus. The Cheetah appeared on Earth around 4 million years ago, well before the other big cats. The Cheetah is unique for its speed but lacks the ability to climb like other cats.",
            "characteristics": "Cheetahs measure 1.6 \u2013 2.1 metres (5.25 \u2013 7 feet) in length and weigh around 30 \u2013 45 kilograms (66 \u2013 99 pounds). Males are slightly larger than females.The Cheetah has a short, buff/tan colored coat which is covered in black, evenly spaced spots. It has a white underbelly and the spots on its tail merge to form 4 to 5 rings at the end.Cheetahs are sometimes confused with Leopards but they can be identified by distinctive black stripes on their faces. The black lines down their faces and under their eyes act like anti-glare devices when they are sprinting.\u00a0These beautiful, graceful cats have long, lean bodies, long legs and a small head, which makes them perfectly adapted to their rapid, agile hunting behaviour. Their physical features are said to resemble those of a racing dog. Their faces are short and flat and their eyes are positioned forward facing to give them excellent binocular vision. Their eyes also have an image stabilization system which enables them to keep a sharp focus on their prey while running at high speeds.Cheetahs are specially adapted for hunting with their lightweight skeletons, large muscle mass and non-retractable claws which help them to grip the soil and give them good acceleration and speed in short bursts. Their dew-claws are curved and sharp and used to grasp prey.Cheetahs have very flexible spines and when they are sprinting, their spines flex and straighten allowing their powerful hind legs to achieve longer, more effective strides making them capable of reaching speeds of 110 kilometres per hour (70 miles per hour). They are able to accelerate from 0 to 64 kilometres per hour (40 miles per hour) in just 3 strides. Their long tails (28 inches) act as rudders and allows the Cheetah to achieve extremely tight turns when pursuing agile prey.Cheetahs have large nasal passages, large lungs and liver and a powerful heart. Their paws are not as rounded as in other cats and their pads are hard to help them in fast, sharp turns.",
            "habitat": "A Cheetahs preferred habitat is open savannas and grasslands. They can be easily observed on open plains with short grasses. They use a wide variety of habitats including dense vegetation and even mountainous terrains. Cheetahs do, however, require an environment with tall grasses, bushes and large plants in order to hide from predators.",
            "diet": "Cheetahs are carnivores and will feed upon antelopes, rabbits, young ostriches and a range of hoofed grassland animals. Because cheetahs rely on sight for hunting, they are diurnal animals mainly hunting their prey early in the morning and late afternoon when temperatures are cooler.",
            "behaviour": "Cheetahs live alone or in small groups. When hunting, a Cheetah will pursue its prey for over 400 metres before giving up and looking for another animal to chase. A Cheetah will get as near to its prey as possible before chasing it as fast as it can go.Unlike other cats, cheetahs use speed instead of stealth to run down prey and as they have small, weak teeth and jaws they are unable to deliver a death bite, however, on trapping their prey with their claws, they deliver a bite to the preys throat which suffocates them. Because their sprints are so fast, cheetahs become breathless and overheated within 30 seconds. After a sustained effort in chasing and killing their prey a cheetah may rest for around half an hour before they begin to eat.A cheetah cannot roar like other big cats, however, its vocalizations include purring, chirping, growling and hissing.",
            "reproduction": "Female cheetahs mature at 3 years and males at 3 \u2013 4 years. The mating period can be between one day or up to a week. The female cheetahsgestation period is 90 \u2013 95 days after which she will give birth a litter of 4 \u2013 6 cubs in a quiet, hidden location usually in tall grass. Litters are born every 2 \u2013 3 years.Newborn cubs weigh between 9 and 15 ounces and are blind and completely helpless at birth. They have dark fur and their spots are blended together and are barely visible. At 4 \u2013 10 days old, the cubs will open their eyes and begin to crawl around the nest area. Their teeth start to appear through their gums at around 3 weeks old.During the first few weeks of the cubs life, a yellow/tan mantle with grow along the cubs back which acts as protection against the rain and sun. The mantle almost completely disappears after 3 months leaving a small mane which remains until they are 2 years of age.Because the cheetah is not an aggressive cat and is unable to fight off larger predators that may attack their young, only around one in twenty cubs will survive to adulthood as many are usually killed by lions and hyenas. Surviving cubs learn to chase small prey, such as a young gazelle under the watchful eye of their mother. They practice the skills they will need to survive as an independent adult. As their skills develop, they must learn how to handle larger prey in order to survive.At around 6 months old, the cubs are half the size of an adult cheetah. They remain with their mother for 16 to 18 months, after which the mother will leave the cubs to rebreed. The cubs will remain together for a further few months until the females are ready to breed and the males are chased away by dominant breeding males. Male cubs will stay together forming a coalition to defend territory.A breeding female cheetah requires a hunting range of up to 800 square kilometres (300 square miles) and apart from some National Parks and isolated populations, suitable territories are mainly restricted to Namibia and parts of South Africa. The life span of a cheetah is 15 \u2013 20 years in the wild.",
            "conservation status": "Sadly, despite numerous captive breeding efforts, the Cheetah is now classed as a Critically Endangered Species by the IUCN. Their decline in numbers is a result of hunting for their beautiful skins and only between 10,000 and 12,000 cheetahs exist in the wild.The Asian cheetah is on the verge of extinction due to over hunting, prey and habitat loss. Only around 100 remain in small, isolated populations. The African cheetah numbers are declining even in protected wildlife reserves due to increased competition from larger predators such as lions and hyenas."

It is widely distributed in North America, from Alaska, east to Newfoundland, south to Smoky Mountains and south through Rocky Mountains to Arizona and New Mexico and particularly in Pacific coastal states. The Native Americans of Kings River called it the \u2018Pillillooeet\u2019, in imitation of its characteristic alarm call. The Chickaree is a lively, noisy little squirrel that is quite human fearless. ",

Their weight ranges from 160 \u2013 300 grams. During the summer, Chickarees have a grey/brown to rusty red fur on their backs with pale orange chests and brown legs and feet, however, come winter, their upper fur appears browner and underparts appear more grey in color. The upper and under parts are separated by a ventral dark or white colored stripe.The tail of the Chickaree can be distinguished from other squirrels as it is more thinner and flatter but still very bushy. Like many other species of squirrel, the Chickaree has a white ring around its eye.",
            "habitat": "The Chickaree squirrel is strictly a forest-dweller and is found throughout the northern boreal forests. They prefer coniferous and mixed forests, however, it is frequently found in deciduous woodlands, hedgerows and second-growth areas.Chickarees usually den in a tree cavities, often a woodpecker hole high up in trees as high as 60 feet. They sometimes inhabit a hollow stump or even make burrows underground, however, these are usually used for food storage. Occasionally, chickarees build a bulky nest of twigs and leaves in a tree crotch for use during the summer.",
            "diet": "Chickarees are omnivorous and eat whatever food is available. Their main diet is nuts, seeds, fruit, acorns, berries and mushrooms (a mushroom called \u2018Amanita\u2019 that is poisonous to humans), however, being more carnivorous than other squirrels, the Chickaree has gained a bad reputation because some devour the eggs and young of nesting birds such as the Yellow Warbler.Chickarees store food in large quantities for use in Autumn and winter. Their winter stores sometimes contain more than 150 pinecones. Unlike many other types of tree squirrel, they lack cheek pouches in which to hold food.",
            "squirrel behaviour": "Chickaree squirrels are noisy characters and can be heard chattering and repeating their calls often. They have a routine call which is repeated every minute or so. Chickarees are nervous, inquisitive little characters who are active by day, particularly at dawn and in late afternoon throughout the year. They sleep at night.Chickarees are very territorial and during the winter occupy territories of around 10,000 square metres. During mating season, a pair of chickarees will defend a single territory together. Groups of chickarees seen together are usually young from a single litter. Chickarees are capable of both swimming and diving.",
            "reproduction": "Chickarees breed from March/April through to June/July, however, breeding season can begin as early as February. Female chickarees enter into estrous for one day only. Their gestation period is around 31 \u2013 35 days (4 \u2013 5 weeks) after which time a litter of 4 \u2013 6 young are born. Young are known as kits. One litter per year is normal, however, in some areas such as the southern and lower parts of their range, they produce two litters each year. Some females are able to breed when they are less than a year old.",
            "squirrel conservation status": "Chickarees have many predators including several hawks, some owls, weasels, mink, foxes, wolves, the lynx, the bobcat or bay lynx and in coniferous forests, the pine marten which pursues and captures them in trees.Despite commercial thinning of forests, Chickarees are demonstrably widespread, abundant and secure and classed as \u2018Least Concern\u2019 on the IUCN list.\u00a0"

The chicken is believed to have descended from the wild Indian and south-east Asian Red Junglefowl which is biologically classified as the same species. With a population of more than 24 billion in 2003, there are more chickens in the world than any other bird. Chickens provide two sources of food frequently consumed by humans: their meat, also known as chicken, and eggs which they lay. Chickens have a great usefulness to humans. Chickens can be kept as pets, for breeding, egg laying and a food product. There are many different breeds that come in a variety of colors. They are commonly farmed all over the world.",
            "chicken diet": "Chickens have a varied diet. Chickens are omnivores and will feed on small seeds, herbs and leaves, grubs, insects and even small mammals like mice, if they can catch them. Domestic chickens are typically fed commercially prepared feed that includes a protein source as well as grains. Chickens often scratch at the soil to get at adult insects and larva or seed. Chickens have a well-developed gizzard (a part of the stomach that contains tiny stones) that grinds up their food.",
            "flightless birds": "Although chickens are flightless birds, they do have a tendency to attempt flight. Chickens do this by running and flapping their wings. Unfortunately, they are not capable of staying airbourne. Chickens sometimes can fly for very short distances such as over fences. Chickens will sometimes attempt flight simply to explore their surroundings, however, they will especially fly in an attempt to flee when they perceive danger or pursued by a predator.",
            "chicken behaviour": "Chickens are gregarious birds and live together as a flock. Chickens have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a \u2018pecking order\u2019, with dominant individuals having priority for access to food and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established.",
            "chicken reproduction": "When a rooster finds food he may call the other chickens to eat it first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This is part of chicken courting ritual. When a hen becomes familiar coming to his \u2018call\u2019 the rooster may mate with the hen and fertilize her egg.",
            "broody hens": "Sometimes a hen will stop laying eggs to concentrate on the incubation of her eggs. This state is commonly known as \u2018going broody\u2019. A broody hen will sit fast on her nest and will protest if disturbed or removed. She will rarely leave the nest to eat, drink or dust-bathe.All the time she is sitting in the nest she will regularly turn the eggs keeping them at a constant temperature and humidity.At the end of the incubation period, which is an average of 21 days, the eggs (if fertilized) will hatch and the broody hen will take care of her young. Since individual eggs do not all hatch at exactly the same time (the chicken can only lay one egg approximately every 25 hours), the hen will usually stay on the nest for about two days after the first egg hatches.During this time, the newly-hatched chicks live off the egg yolk they absorb just before hatching. The hen can hear the chicks peeping inside the eggs, and will gently cluck to encourage them to break out of their shells. If the eggs are not fertilized and do not hatch, the hen will eventually grow tired of being broody and leave the nest.Modern egg-laying breeds rarely go broody and those that do often stop part-way through the incubation cycle. Some breeds, such as the Cochin, Cornish and Silkie, regularly go broody and make excellent mothers.",

The Common Chimpanzee is closely related to the Bonobo (one of the two species making up the chimpanzee genus, \u2018Pan\u2019) or \u2018Pygmy Chimpanzee\u2019. Chimpanzees are intelligent animals and have a complex behaviour and communication system.

Males can measure up to 160 centimetres (63 inches) and females up to 130 centimetres (51 inches) in height. Although they are lighter than humans, they have a pull five to six times stronger. This is because the muscles of the Common Chimpanzee and other primates are far more effective than those of humans.The chimpanzees body is covered with coarse dark brown hair, except for the face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Both of its thumbs and its big toes are opposable, allowing a precision grip.",
            "diet": "Like humans, chimpanzees are omnivorous, meaning their diet consists of plants and animals. Some of the foods a chimpanzee will eat include seeds, fruits, leaves, bark, insects such as termites and small prey. Chimpanzees will often use a twig as a tool to help them reach termites or ants in nests and have been seen using sticks to hunt other small mammals.There are also instances of organized hunting. In some cases, such as the killing of Leopard cubs, this primarily seems to be a protective effort, since the Leopard is the main natural predator of the Common Chimpanzee. However, the Common Chimpanzee sometimes bands together and hunts Western Red Colobus Monkeys (Piliocolobus badius) for meat. Isolated cases of cannibalism have also been documented.",
            "habitat": "Common Chimpanzees are found in the tropical forests and wet savannas of Western and Central Africa at low altitude. The chimpanzee will spend time both in trees and on the ground, but will usually sleep in a tree where it will build a nest for the night. They once inhabited most of this region, but their habitat has been dramatically reduced in recent years.",
            "behaviour": "Common Chimpanzees live in communities that typically range from 20 to more than 150 members, but spend most of their time traveling in small parties of just a few individuals. Common Chimpanzees are both arboreal and terrestrial, spending equal amounts of time in the trees and on the ground.Common Chimpanzees walk using the soles of their feet and resting on their knuckles, but they can walk upright for short distances. Common Chimpanzees are \u2018knuckle walkers\u2019, like gorillas, in contrast to the quadrupedal locomotion (a form of land animal locomotion using four legs) of orangutans and bonobos known as \u2018palm walkers\u2019 who use the outside edge of their palms.When confronted by a predator, chimpanzees will react with loud screams and use any object they can get against the threat.

There are two species of chinchilla, Chinchilla lanigera and Chinchilla brevicaudata. There is little noticeable difference between the two species except that the Chinchilla brevicaudata has a shorter tail, a thicker neck and shoulders and shorter ears. The chinchilla belongs to the family Chinchillidae, along with their relatives the viscachas. They belong to the order Rodentia. The name \u2018Chinchilla\u2019 means \u2018Little Chincha\u2019, named after the Chincha people of the Andes. The Chincha people hunted them for their soft, dense fur.

However, because of their shy, sensitive and intelligent nature, they have become increasingly popular as house pets.",
            "description": "Chinchillas are small animals, with slender bodies and a tail measuring up to a third of its body size. They have a body length of 9 to 14 inches (23 to 36 centimeters) and 3 to 6 inch (7 to 15 centimeter) bushy tails. Female chinchillas are slightly larger than males, although they both weigh between 400 and 500 grams.Chinchillas can be found in a variety of colors. Wild chinchillas are grey in color, however, domestic chinchillas can be beige, a light champagne color and many other colors. Their underparts are a light yellow color.They are covered in dense, soft fur to insulate them from the cold barren mountainous regions where they live. The chinchilla has the densest fur of all mammals that live on land; in the water, the sea otter has a denser coat. Their thick fur coat is one of the main reasons why they were hunted in the 19th century. Their hair is about 1.5 inches (40 millimeters) longChinchillas have long, strong hind legs, which enable them to run and jump agilely up to 5 feet (1.5 metres) high. They have short front legs, which are used to hold food as they sit upright. They also have short forefeet with five digits, and narrow hindfeet that have three digits and a rudimentary digit with stiff bristles surrounding a small, flat claw. These bristles may help provide traction on rocky terrain.Their heart rate ranges from 100 \u2013 150 beats per minute. They are unable to pant or sweat, meaning that they can easily overheat or suffer heat stroke in human care. The chinchilla\u2019s only cooling mechanism is to pump blood through its large ears, which have less hair.There are differences between the two species. C. chinchilla has a shorter tail, a thicker neck and shoulders, and shorter ears than C. lanigera. Domesticated chinchillas are thought to be of the C. lanigera species. These domestic chinchillas, which have been selectively bred for nearly 100 years, are almost twice the size of those in the wilderness.",
            "s live?": "The chinchilla has a lifespan of around 6 years in the wild, but captivity it can be up to 20 years.",
            "location and habitat": "Chinchillas are native to the Andes mountains of South America. They were once common along the entire western coastline of South America, including Argentina, but are now limited mainly to the countries of Bolivia, Peru, and Chile.Their preferred habitats are burrows or rock crevices. They also inhabit barren, arid areas of mountains at elevations of 3,000 \u2013 5,000 metres. A typical habitat is rocky or sandy with sparse cover of thorny shrubs, few herbs and forbs, scattered cactuses, and patches of succulent bromeliads near the coast.Living in arid areas, chinchillas are adapted to conserve energy. They produce concentrated urine and small, dry faeces, and their dense hair prevents heat and water loss.",
            "diet": "Chinchillas are strictly herbivores and feed primarily on seeds and grass. They also eat a variety of other vegetation and plant matter, such as bark and succulents like bromeliads and cacti. Their diet changes seasonally, with its most common food being the perennial Chilean needlegrass. Despite the arid area that they live in, they are selective eaters.While eating, they sit upright on their hind legs and hold the food in their front paws.",
            "behaviour": "In the wild, chinchillas are very social and live in social groups called herds which can range from 14 members up to 100. The herds are for both social interaction as well as protection from predators. Females are dominant and aggressive toward other females as well as the males during estrus, although serious fighting is rare.Chinchillas are primarily nocturnal animals with activity peaking at dusk and dawn. During the day they rest in holes and crevices among rocks, emerging at dusk to forage through the night. They use conspicuous rocks for observing their range. They are constantly eating, because their incisors are ever growing and need to be kept in good condition by gnawing and chewing.Chinchillas make a variety of vocalizations, including chirps, squeaks and barks. They use these sounds to express themselves, from a calm, loving chirp given to a potential mate to a loud, aggressive bark when threatened.Chinchillas are also very clean creatures. To maintain a healthy fur coat, chinchillas take dust baths regularly, leaving a whispered circle of light, fine pumice dust.",
            "reproduction": "Both male and female chinchillas reach sexual maturity at 8 months old. Breeding season is mainly during November and May, however, they may breed at any time of the year. Female chinchillas enter into estrous which lasts around 30 to 50 days. The female gestation period is quite long compared to other rodents, lasting around 111 days. The average litter size is between 1 and 6 young, called kits, although the average is two.The kits weigh 30 to 60 grams at birth and because of the length of the gestation period, they are born with fur and with their eyes open. The kits suckle milk until they are weaned at 6 to 8 weeks old.Chinchilla kits often greet their parents with a very high pitch chirp, usually to indicate that they are hungry. Unlike other rodents, males stick around and may assist with parental duties like babysitting. Females can also help out other mothers; should a female be unable to nurse her offspring, another female may step up to feed the youngsters.Chinchilla Conservation StatusBoth species of chinchilla are currently listed as Endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and their populations are declining. Populations have mostly suffered due to habitat loss by the burning and harvesting of the algarobilla shrub at lower altitudes, and grazing by cattle and goats. There are currently only an estimated 10,000 individuals left in the Chilean mountains.Chinchillas are protected by law in their natural habitat because their an endangered species, however, it is difficult to monitor hunting in the remote mountain ranges of the Andes and illegal hunting does continue in some areas. They are mostly hunted for their fur in the wild, despite this being illegal. Human intervention and conservation measures are required to prevent extinction in the wild. Breeding in captivity, however, is still successful and hundreds of chinchillas are bred for pets. Domesticated chinchillas are also bred for fur.",
            "predators": "Predators in the wild include birds of prey, skunks, felines, snakes and canines. Chinchillas have a variety of defensive tactics, including spraying urine and releasing fur if bitten.",

            "desc": "The Chinese Hamster is a species of hamster, scientific name Cricetulus griseus, which originate in the deserts of northern China and Mongolia. Chinese hamsters grow to between 7.5 and 9 centimetres in length and as adults can weight 50 \u2013 75 grams. Chinese Hamsters live two to three years on average. A Chinese hamsters body proportions, compared with those of other hamsters, appear \u2018long and thin\u2019 and they have (for a hamster) a relatively long tail. Chinese hamsters are not, technically, \u2018dwarf\u2019 hamsters since this term refers to animals in the genus Phodopus, (the two types of Russian Dwarf Hamsters and Roborovskii Dwarf Hamsters). The wild color is greyish brown above with a black stripe down the spine and a whitish belly. This coloration, combined with their nimble build and longer tail, makes them look \u2018mousy\u2019 and in fact, they are members of the group called ratlike hamsters. Besides the wild color, a well-known variation is the white-spotted Chinese hamster, which often is greyish white all over, with only a dark stripe on its back.",
            "chinese hamster behaviour": "In its natural habitat the Chinese Hamster lives in burrows which it excavates itself. Some burrows have a single entrance hole while others have two or even three entrances.The complex burrows with multi-entrances are most likely to be the domain of experienced, mature animal and it is probably younger individuals that are responsible for the simpler burrows.Within the larger burrows one finds the main living quarters and separate chambers for food storage and nesting. Although Chinese Hamsters are fiercely territorial, these burrows are often found very close to each other, giving the misleading impression of them living in colonies.Chinese Hamsters possess enormous internal cheek pouches. Chinese Hamsters collect huge quantities of food in their pouches, to transfer to their burrows to consume in relative safety. Chinese Hamsters are excellent climbers, using their slightly prehensile tail as an aid, although in most conventional cages they have little scope to demonstrate their arboreal skills.",
            "in the wild": "In the wild, Chinese Hamsters do not hibernate continuously but awaken from time to time to eat stored food. As the weather becomes colder, Chinese Hamsters enter into deep-sleep and the intervals between spells of waking become longer.",
            "in captivity": "In captivity, as long as the cage is kept in a warm room, there is no reason why your hamster(s) should attempt to hibernate. If the room temperature drops too low, it may fall into a torpor-like state and may even appear to be dead. On no account should you allow this to happen.\u00a0"

Their name derives from the narrow black band under their heads which makes it appear as if they are wearing black helmets, making them one of the most easily identified types of penguin. The Chinstrap Penguins are the most numerous penguins in the world. It is estimated there are 12 to 13 million located on the barren islands of the sub-Antarctic Region and the Antarctic Peninsula. Chinstrap Penguins live and breed in large colonies. They often live on large icebergs on the open ocean. Chinstrap Penguins dive off to catch fish and krill. They are the boldest penguin and are most likely to fight other penguins. Other names for the Chinstrap Penguin are \u2018 Ringed Penguins., \u2018 Bearded Penguins\u2018, and \u2018 Stonecracker Penguins\u2018 due to their harsh call.",
            "characteristics": "The Chinstrap Penguin stand about 28 inches (72 centimetres) tall and weigh about 9 to 14 pounds. (3.5 to 5 kilograms). The weight of the adults vary during the year. Chinstrap Penguins are the heaviest during the molting season and the lightest during the brooding period.Chinstrap penguins have a white front and throat, red eyes and a black back. They have a distinctive black band that runs from one side of the head under the bill to the other side of the head, resembling a chin strap. Their coat of feathers is dense for insulation and water proofing and they have a thick layer of blubber as an energy store. The chicks have grey backs and white fronts.",
            "diet": "The diet of the Chinstrap Penguin consists of: small shoaling animals, krill, small fish and other roaming marine crustaceans. Chinstrap Penguins are considered near-shore feeders foraging among the pack ice, although vagrants may occasionally be seen in the open sea. They feed by pursuit-diving for prey close to their breeding colonies.Diving effort is usually concentrated near midnight and noon and dives typically last less than a minute and are seldom more than 200 feet deep.",
            "behaviour": "Like most penguins, Chinstrap Penguins use their flippers to \u2018fly\u2019 at speeds of up to 20 miles per hour. On land, Chinstraps often \u2018toboggan\u2019 on their stomachs, propelling themselves by their feet and flippers. Chinstrap Penguins climb out of the water and up steep slopes using all four limbs and they are able to jump large distances to reach footholds.Chinstrap Penguins communicate through ritual behaviours of head and flipper waving, calling, bowing, gesturing and preening. Stares, pointing and charging may occur when territorial disputes arise.",
            "reproduction": "Chinstrap penguins make a round nest out of stones and pebbles. Their nests are usually 40 centimetres in diameter and 15 centimetres high. The female lays two eggs in November or December and the eggs are kept warm by both male and female. They do this by taking turns for 5 to 10 days, while the other mate is feeding. The eggs hatch after about 33 to 15 days.The chicks stay in the nest until they are 20 to 30 days old. At this time they have feathers to keep them warm. They join the cr\u00e8ches, which are groups of young penguins huddling together for warmth and protection.",
            "predators": "The principal predator of adult Chinstrap Penguins is the Leopard seal, while the main predators of eggs and chicks are sheathbills and the Brown skua.",
            "conservation": "Chinstrap penguins are not classified as endangered by the 2000 IUCN Red List. In the past, commercial egg collecting has caused damage to rookeries, but they have no legal protection. There are thought to be up to 7.5 million breeding pairs."

There are three genera in this family: Tamias (eastern North America), Neotamias (western North America) and Eutamias (Eurasia). Chipmunks are lively little creatures that are found mostly in North and West America with one species (Asia\u2019s Tamias sibiricus) native to Eurasia. Chipmunks are kept as popular and entertaining pets. ",
            "description": "Chipmunks vary in size and color depending on species. Their size ranges from 7 \u2013 8 inches in length and 32 \u2013 50 grams in weight in the smallest chipmunks to 11 inches in length and 125 grams in weight in larger chipmunks.Chipmunks coats range from reddish brown to grey in color with contrasting dark or light stripes on the side of their faces and across their backs and tails. They have white fur on their underparts and their tail is brown, with varied shades of black near the tip. Chipmunks have large, glossy eyes and characteristic bushy tails measuring 2 \u2013 5 inches which have made them a favourite character with animators.Chipmunks have small but prominent ears which face forwards, small eyes set on the sides of their heads and a pointed muzzle. Although a chipmunks mouth is small, their cheek pouches can expand up to 3 times the size of their head. The chipmunk digs with its front paws, which have four sharp claws on each. The dirt is pushed to the surface, and then carried away in the animals cheeks.",
            "habitat": "Chipmunks are generally seen scampering through the undergrowth of a variety of environments from scrublands, alpine forests to shrubby deserts. Chipmunks construct complex burrows which can measure 3 \u2013 4 metres in length. These burrows have several entrances, tunnels and chambers for sleeping which are kept very clean. Shells and faeces are stored in refuse tunnels. sleeping areas are enlarged and filled with shredded leaves to make a comfortable bed. Food is normally stored in the lowest tunnels, to keep it cool and fresh. Some species of chipmunk make their homes in logs, bushes are abandoned nests.",
            "diet": "Chipmunks have a varied omnivorous diet mainly consisting of nuts, fruits, seeds, berries, grains, birds eggs, small frogs, fungi, insects and worms. Food is stuffed into their large cheek pouches and carried back to store in their dens. Lots of food is gathered and placed in their burrows at the beginning of autumn to store for the winter.Some species of chipmunk make many caches of food. These two behaviours are referred to as \u2018larder hoarding\u2019 and \u2018scatter hoarding\u2019. Larder hoarders usually remain in their nests until spring. Chipmunks generally gather food on the ground in areas with underbrush, rocks and logs, where they can hide from predators like hawks, foxes, coyotes, weasels, and snakes. They will climb trees to collect acorns and hazel nuts, however, they are not as agile as their cousins, the squirrel.Chipmunks fulfil several important functions in forest ecosystems. Their activities which include harvesting and hoarding tree seeds play a crucial role in seedling establishment. Chipmunks also play an important role as prey for various predatory mammals and birds, however, they are also opportunistic predators themselves, particularly with regards to bird eggs and nestlings.Chipmunks that reside in urban areas have been known to take handouts from humans, however, human food is not stored, it is just enjoyed as a novelty.",
            "behaviour": "Chipmunks are very lively and very fast. They have a bird-like chip which is used when danger is sensed or as a mating call for female chipmunks. Other communications include gestures such as waving their tails enabling them to communicate effectively with others of their species. Chipmunks are solitary animals and male and female do not pair until breeding season. Although chipmunks hibernate from late autumn until early spring, they do not store fat, instead they slowly gnaw away at their supplies throughout the winter, waking every 2 weeks or so to eat.",
            "reproduction": "Chipmunk breeding season occurs in early spring and then again in early summer. Litters of 4 \u2013 5 young are produced after a gestation period of 30 days. Western chipmunks only breed once a year. Young are born in burrows where they remain for about 6 weeks. Within 2 weeks of emerging from their burrows they become independent and begin to gather their own stores of food for the winter ahead. Chipmunks are social animals, and both the male and female raise their young. Chipmunks have a life span of 2 \u2013 7 years in the wild.",

When the larvae hatches it feeds on the Cicada wasp. Later the larvae pupates and the wasp hibernates in the nest as an immature adult.",
            "cicada killer wasp and humans": "Female Cicada killer wasps are not aggressive and rarely sting unless handled roughly, disturbed, or caught in clothing, etc. Males aggressively defend their perching areas on nesting sites against rival males but they have no sting. Although they appear to attack anything which moves near their territories, male cicada killers are actually investigating anything which might be a female cicada killer ready to mate.Such close inspection appears to many people to be an attack, but the wasps rarely sting, bite, or even land on people. If handled roughly females will sting, males will jab with a sharp spine on the tip of their abdomen, and both sexes are well equipped to bite with their large jaws, however they are non-aggressive towards humans and fly away when swatted at, instead of attacking.Cicada killer wasps exert a natural control on cicada populations and therefore directly benefit the deciduous trees on which cicadas feed."

Click beetles are a cosmopolitan family characterized by the unusual clicking mechanism they have. There are a few closely-related families in which a few members have the same mechanism, but all elaterids can click. A spine on the prosternum can be snapped into a corresponding notch on the mesosternum, producing a violent clicking sound which can bounce the beetle into the air. Clicking is mainly used to avoid predation, although it is also useful when the beetle is on its back and needs to right itself. There are about 7,000 known species. Click beetles can be large and colorful (some are brilliant metallic green). Most of these beetles are small to medium-sized, dull in color and grow to about 2 centimetres in length. The adults are typically nocturnal (active only at night) and phytophagous (a form of predation in which an organism known as an herbivore, consumes principally autotrophs such as plants, algae and photosynthesizing bacteria)."

The colossal squid is known only from a small number of specimens, and so little is actually known about this squid species. This is due to the fact they live deep in the ocean in freezing waters. We do know, however, that they have a similar appearance to other members of the Cranchiidae family, with hooks on their arms and tentacles. The first report of a colossal squid was in 1925, when the head and arms were discovered in a sperm whale stomach.

            "reproduction": "The reproduction habits of the colossal squid are largely unknown, but we can make assumptions based on other squid species. All squid lay eggs. Some might lay single eggs while others lay clusters of eggs in a large jelly-like floating mass. Once the eggs are hatched, the babies can take between one to three years to become full-sized.It is speculated that the male colossal squids have penises, which is unusual of squids. The adult female colossal squid has been discovered in much shallower waters which likely implies that females spawn in shallower waters than their normal depth.\u00a0Colossal Squid Location and HabitatThe colossal squid is found in the Southern Ocean from Antarctica to the southern tips of Africa, South America, and New Zealand. It is thought that they must inhabit depths of at least 2200 m, because they have been found in the stomachs of sperm whales.Juvenile colossal squids, however, tend to live in the upper 1000 m of the ocean and have not been found below 1000 m. As the squid grows older it moves into deeper and darker waters, possibly to reduce the possibility of it being detected, and also to reduce predation pressure.\u00a0Colossal Squid Conservation StatusThe colossal squid has rarely been documented, but it is not thought they are an endangered species. They are listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.Roughly 12 colossal squids were recorded up to the year 2015, but there could be many more as they are notoriously hard to trace.",

            "desc": "The Common Buzzard is a large bird of prey and one of the most visible of Britain\u2019s raptors. The Common Buzzard has a large British population and can often be seen on a clear day out in the British countryside. It can be observed either sitting on a fence post awaiting its next meal to pass by or soaring swiftly in groups of two or more on the afternoon thermals. Buzzards are to be found throughout much of the UK but are still best found in hilly terrain in the West of the UK, especially in areas with barren open ground. Some good places include Dartmoor and the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire. In Scotland, because of their size, behaviour and markings, the Common Buzzard is often mistaken for juvenile Golden Eagles, especially when they are soaring.",
            "characteristics": "The Common Buzzard typically measures between 51 \u2013 57 centimetres in length with a 110 to 130 centimetres (48 \u2013 60 inches) wingspan . Females weigh as much as 1.3 kilograms. Males tend to weigh less and as such are the more efficient hunters and fliers.The Common Buzzards plumage is a rich brown, with lighter markings beneath. In flight the wings have a ragged, moth-like appearance as this bird glides to and fro at a tremendous height. The plumage can vary in Britain from almost pure white to black, however, it is usually shades of brown, with a white \u2018necklace\u2019 of feathers.",
            "diet": "Common Buzzards feed mainly on Rabbits but will take just about any small mammal, reptile and often carrion (the carcass of a dead animal). The birds can occasionally be seen standing proudly on a piece of road kill defending it whilst they eat.A great opportunist, it adapts well to a varied diet of pheasant, other small mammals, snakes and lizards and can often be seen walking over recently ploughed fields looking for worms and insects.",
            "behaviour": "Common Buzzards do not normally form flocks, however, several may be seen together on migration or in good habitat. As many as 20 buzzards have been spotted in one small area, though usually an average of 30 metres apart from each other. Extremely territorial, fights do break out if one strays on another pairs territory.Many smaller birds such as crows and Jackdaws see them as a threat and will pester them into moving from a particular tree or area by mobbing them repeatedly until they fly away.",
            "reproduction": "Pairs mate for life. To attract a mate (or impress his existing mate) the male performs a ritual aerial display before the beginning of Spring. This spectacular display is known as \u2018the roller coaster\u2019. He will rise high up in the sky, to turn and plummet downward, in a spiral, twisting and turning as he comes down. He will then rise immediately upward to repeat the exercise.The Common Buzzard breeds in woodland, usually on the fringes. The female lays between 2 and 4 eggs, sharing the 33 \u2013 35 day job of incubation with the male bird. The young leave the nest after a couple of months, becoming fully independent at around 5 months, and becoming active breeders after 2 \u2013 3 years.",
            "conservation status": "Because of human persecution and the introduction of myxomatosis amongst the rabbit population in the 1950\u2019s, buzzards became very scarce, only residing over high ground in the areas such as Brecon in Wales and the Cairngorms in Scotland. As the few surviving rabbits re-produced and became more resistant to the Myxomatosis virus, their numbers increased and with it the population and distribution of buzzards and other birds of prey. Their numbers are thought to be as high as 60,000 pairs throughout the UK, making them the most prevalent of UK birds of prey."

            "desc": "The Common Dolphin is the name given to up to three species of dolphin making up the genus Delphinus. The most common of these dolphins are the Long Beaked Dolphin and the Short Beaked Dolphin. The third species (D. tropicalis, common name usually Arabian Common Dolphin), is characterized by an extremely long and thin beak and found in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean. Common dolphins are also known by other names: Saddleback dolphin, White-bellied porpoise, Criss-cross dolphin, Hourglass dolphin and Cape dolphin. Despite its name the common dolphin is not the dolphin of popular imagination \u2013 that distinction belongs to the Bottlenose Dolphin, largely due to the television series\u2019 Flipper\u2019.",
            "": "Common dolphins have an hourglass pattern and tan or yellowish patch on each side which makes them easily recognisable, although they can sometimes be confused with Striped Dolphins. They have a dark cape ranging from black to brown with a v-shape under the dorsal fin. Their undersides are white with the occasional yellow streak and they have a white tail stock. Their flukes are dark on both sides and their dorsal fins range from curved to triangular and can be colored black, greyish white or somewhere in-between. There are only subtle differences between the males and females which sometimes makes it difficult to tell them apart.Common Dolphins have a streamlined body and a long slender beak. They have a single blowhole and their flippers are pointed. Common dolphins are fast active swimmers.When they are born, common dolphins are about 80 centimetres long (32 inches). Common dolphins can grow to be between 1.7 and 2.4 metres (5 feet 9 inches \u2013 8 feet) in length.Little is known about how much common dolphins weigh at birth, however, as adults, they weigh between 70 and 110 kilograms (155 \u2013 245 pounds).",
            "behaviour": "Common dolphins travel in groups of around 10 \u2013 50 in number and frequently gather into schools containing 100 to 2000 individuals. Their school size depends upon the time of day and season. When they are frightened, they bunch tightly together. Common dolphins are fast swimmers and enjoy acrobatics. These schools are generally very active \u2013 groups often surface, jump and splash together. Typical behaviour includes breaching, tail-slapping, chin-slapping, bow-riding and porpoising.Common Dolphins do short dives of 10 seconds to 2 minutes, although dives of 8 minutes have been recorded.Common dolphins have been seen to mix with other cetaceans such as other dolphins in the Yellowfin tuna grounds of the eastern Pacific and also schools of Pilot Whales. An interesting theory suggests that dolphins \u2018bow-riding\u2019 on very large whales was how they began to bow-ride on boats.Common Dolphins are found in many enclosed seas and are rarely seen in waters less than 180 metres deep. In some areas, common dolphins are present all year round but other populations migrate seasonally. Common Dolphins can be observed regularly around the Galapagos waters.",
            "diet": "The diet of the Common Dolphin mainly consists of fish and squid.",
            "communication": "Common Dolphins are highly vocal and can be heard above the surface.",
            "reproduction": "The gestation period for the female Common dolphin is about 11 months and the calving period is between 1 and 3 years. Common dolphins become sexually mature at 5 years and their life span varies between 20 to 25 years. These figures are subject to large variation across different populations.Common Dolphin PredatorsSome sharks (including tiger sharks, dusky sharks, and bull sharks) and orcas will prey upon dolphins. Dolphins are also often trapped in fishing nets.",
            "conservation": "Common dolphins face a mixture of threats due to human influence. Populations have been hunted off the coast of Peru for use as food and shark bait. In most other areas the dolphins have not been hunted directly. Several thousand individuals have been caught in industrial trawler nets throughout their range. Common dolphins were abundant in the western Mediterranean Sea until the 1960s but occurrences there have tailed off rapidly. The reasons are not well understood but are believed to be due to extensive human activity in the area. In the U.S. they are a protected species and sometimes are caught by accident in some trawler nets as bycatch, though despite this they are still quite common throughout their range."

The Common Frog is found throughout much of Europe as far north as the Arctic Circle. The Common Frog can also be found in Ireland and is the only frog that is found there. However, it is not a native species and was introduced to the country. Other areas which the Common Frog has been introduced to include the Isle of Lewis, the Shetland Islands and the Orkney Islands, all in Scotland. The adult Common Frog measures around 6 \u2013 9 centimetres long. This species of frog is sometimes confused with the Common Toad, however, the common frog differs from the common toad by its smoother skin compared to the toads more warty skin, and longer hind legs.",

This species of frog is sometimes confused with the Common Toad, however, the common frog differs from the common toad by its smoother skin compared to the toads more warty skin, and longer hind legs.The hind legs of the common frog are, however, short compared with other frog species. Another difference between the common frog and the common toad is, the common frog is larger and common frogs hop as opposed to the toads habit of walking. Finally, toads lack dark patches behind the eye often seen on Common Frogs.The backs and flanks of the common frog vary in color, with olive green, grey-brown, brown, olive-brown, greyand yellow. However, Common Frogs are known to be able to lighten and darken their skin in order to match their surroundings. It is also not unknown for more unusual coloration, both black and red individuals have been found in Scotland. Additionally, albino Common Frogs have been found with yellow skin and red eyes.Common Frogs flanks, limbs and backs are covered with irregular dark blotches and they usually have a chevron-shaped spot on the back of their neck. Unlike other amphibians, Common Frogs generally lack a mid dorsal band and when they have one, it is quite faint. The frogs underbellies are white or yellow (occasionally more orange in females) and can be speckled with brown or orange.Common frogs have short hind legs, as aforementioned, and they have webbed feet. Their snout is rounded and their large black/brown eyes are surrounded by gold, flecked with brown. Common frogs have transparent horizontal pupils and they have transparent inner eyelids to protect their eyes while underwater, as well as a \u2018mask\u2019 which covers their eyes and eardrums.Males can be distinguished from females due to hard swellings, called nuptial pads, on their first finger. The nuptial pads are used for gripping females when mating. Males also possess paired vocal sacs, which the females lack.Frogs cannot swallow, so they \u2018push\u2019 their food down by using their large eyes, this means they must close their eyes to swallow.",
            "habitats": "Common frogs are largely terrestrial outside the breeding season and can be found in meadows, gardens and woodland. Common frogs hibernate and breed in puddles, ponds, lakes and canals, muddy burrows and can also hibernate in layers of decaying leaves and mud at the bottom of ponds. The fact that they can breathe through their skins allows them to stay underwater for much longer periods of time when they are hibernating.",
            "diet": "Adult Common Frogs will feed on any invertebrate of a suitable size. Snails, slugs, worms, beetles, woodlice and flies are all flicked into the frogs wide mouth by its long tongue. The frogs hunt/catch these animals by catching them on their long, sticky tongues. The diets of Common Frogs change significantly throughout their lives, the oldest frogs will feed only on land, younger frogs will also feed in the water. Tadpoles are mostly herbivores, feeding on algae, detritus (bodies of dead organisms) and some plants. They will also eat other animals in small amounts. Common frogs do not feed throughout the breeding season.",
            "behaviour": "Common frogs are active almost all of the year, only hibernating when it gets very cold and the water and earth are frozen. In the British Isles, common frogs typically hibernate from late October to January. They will re-emerge as early as February if conditions are suitable and migrate to bodies of water such as garden ponds. Common frogs hibernate in running waters, muddy burrows and can hibernate in layers of decaying leaves and mud at the bottom of ponds. The fact that they can breathe through their skin allows them to stay underwater for much longer periods of time when they are hibernating.",
            "reproduction": "Frogs are amphibians and in most parts of the UK, they start spawning in spring. During the mating season, the throat of the male frog turns a bluish color, they are generally light and greyish in color and the female turns browner or sometimes red. The adults congregate in the ponds, where the males compete for females. The courtship ritual involves croaking and a successful male grasps the female under the forelegs. The females, which are generally larger than the males, lay up to 4000 eggs which float in large clusters. The clumps of jelly-like eggs are usually laid around March time. Tadpoles which emerge from the spawn generally take around 12 weeks to develop into tiny froglets. They need water to keep their skin moist so are normally found near water. In the wild, the Common frog has a life span of around 8 years.",

The Common Hippopotamus can measure up to 13 feet long (twice as long as a very tall human being) and 5 feet tall.  The Common Hippopotamus has a plump, bulky body which balances on four short stumpy legs. These \u2018stumpy\u2019 legs are quite versatile. Each hippo foot has 4 toes and although they are webbed, for water usage, they are evenly sprayed enough to support the hippo when it is on land.",
            "common hippo characteristics": "The Common Hippopotamus has a plump, bulky body which balances on four short stumpy legs. These \u2018stumpy\u2019 legs are quite versatile. Each hippo foot has 4 toes and although they are webbed, for water usage, they are evenly sprayed enough to support the hippo when it is on land.A hippos skin is usually greyish-brown and is completely hairless, apart from a few bristles around its mouth and tail-end. Although the hippo has no sweat glands in the skin (like a pig), they have special glands that produce a red fluid. This red fluid protects their skin from the sun and from infections, although they do rely heavily on cool water and mud to prevent over-heating and dehydration. The production of this fluid increases rapidly when the hippo is excited.The hippo has a head shaped like a huge muzzle (female heads are slightly smaller). A hippos small eyes, little ears and nostrils are placed high upon their heads \u2013 this enables the hippo to smell, see and breath while most of its body is submerged under the water.Although hippos cannot swim because their bodies are too dense to float, they spend most of the day in the water. Hippos can stay underneath the water for about 6 minutes at a time \u2013 to do this they take a deep breath and close off their ears and nostrils. As hippos cannot swim, they move around by pushing their feet off the riverbed and gallop around the bottom of the river in a surprisingly graceful style which could resemble a ballet dancer.Hippo\u2019s huge mouths consist of lips that are 2 feet wide and teeth that can bite a 10 foot crocodile in half. Hippos can open their mouths to a massive 150 degrees or 4 feet wide which show their large tusk-like canines and razor-sharp incisors, capable of biting a small boat in half.",
            "behaviour": "Believe it or not, these large, docile looking animals are actually very aggressive. Despite their size, hippos can out-run a human and can reach speeds of 30 miles per hour. Hippos have developed some well known rituals to show aggression \u2013 the large \u2018yawn\u2019 does not mean hippo is tired, it is one of their most aggressive forms and shows confrontation in the water. Basically, being unpredictable, anything that gets in their way will be bitten or trampled.Here are some more common aggressive rituals of the Common Hippo:Dung showering \u2013 they use their tails to paddle the dung to show dominance \u2013 usually done by bulls (male hippos).Rearing, lunging and jaw-clashing.Facing aggressor with mouth open \u2013 mostly done by a defensive female when protecting her young.Other sounds and actions displaying aggression are:Water-scooping, head shaking, charging and chasing.Grunting, roaring and exhaling explosively above or below the water.Male hippos also have a submissive behaviour \u2013 here are some examples:Approaching in a crouched position \u2013 head low \u2013 this is an act of a subordinate male (one who has less dominance) to a dominant male.Lying prone (low, with face down) on land \u2013 this usually occurs when the male hippo is a threat of disturbing a calf nursery \u2013 they can escape the wrath of the female by laying proneHippos are gregarious animals which means they move around in groups, enjoying company of others. Hippos live in herds of 10 \u2013 40 individuals, however, herds of 100 or more hippos have been observed. The dominant male is the only one allowed to mate with the females of the herd, although sometimes he will allow a subordinate male to mate.The dominant hippo males territory is well marked with his dung. The effective scent of the dung warns off other male hippos who might try and invade his territory. Sometimes fights can ensue when the territory is threatened by a rival hippo resulting in injury and sometimes death.Hippos are not susceptible to disease therefore in suitable habitats and conditions their numbers can increase rapidly. A hippos only predators are other hippos and unfortunately human beings who hunt them for their hides, tusks and for meat.The bellowing of a bull hippo measures an ear-splitting 115 decibels and sounds like the roar of a lion.",
            "diet": "Although hippos have very sharp teeth and are very large animals, they are in fact herbivores which means they do not eat meat, only plants. Hippos may stay in the waters all day, however, at night they come out of the lakes, swamps and ponds and head for the grass to graze.They are amazingly agile animals and good climbers for their size. At night they will climb steep banks to graze on grass. They can get through around 100 pounds of grass in one night. This grazing goes on for most of the night, then, before sunrise, they head back into the waters and swamps to digest their food and for another day of lazing beneath the waters surface.",
            "reproduction": "Male hippos are about 7 years old and females about 9 years old when they become ready to mate. Hippo mating usually happens within the dry seasons when most of the hippos have congregated around water sources. Mating usually takes place under the water. The female hippo will carry her baby for about 240 days. When the time comes to give birth, she will separate from the herd and isolate herself.One single calf is born, usually underwater and mother and calf will stay together away from the herd for between 10 \u2013 44 days. The mother hippo will nudge her calf to the surface of the water to catch its first breath and then the calf will take a breath, close its nostrils, fold its ears and submerge to nurse on its mother.A female hippo will give birth to a single calf every two years. Calves are usually born in the rainy season and weigh about 93 pounds at birth. Calves will begin to eat grass at about 3 weeks old, however, it will continue to nurse from its mother for about a year. Serious grazing at night begins at around 5 months old. Calves stay close to their mothers for protection, not only from crocodiles and lions, but from male hippos who oddly enough do not bother with the calves on land but can attack young males in the water.On land, the calves can also be trampled on by the male hippos during chasing, fighting and stampedes. If a male hippo comes near the young, a mother hippo will mob the male hippo who will then lay low and still to let her know he meant no harm. It is unsure why the male hippos attack the young male hippos, maybe because they are male and are seen as a threat. Most often, nurseries are developed containing many small calves who are protected by 1 \u2013 7 cows while the other mothers go and graze.",
            "conservation status": "Hippo populations across the continent are threatened by habitat loss and unregulated hunting. The hippopotamus has been moved on to the so-called Red List drawn up by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) in May 2006. This signifies that the common hippopotamus is now in serious danger of extinction."

Kingfishers are widespread, especially in central and southern England, becoming less common further north, however, following some declines last century, they are currently increasing in their range in Scotland. Kingfishers are found by still or slow flowing water such as lakes, canals and rivers in lowland areas. In winter, some individuals move to estuaries and the coast. Occasionally they may visit suitably sized garden ponds.",
            "kingfisher description": "Common Kingfishers measure 17 \u2013 19 centimetres in length, weigh between 34 \u2013 46 grams and have a wingspan of 25 centimetres. Their beak is around 4 centimetres long and pointed. Kingfishers have short, orange colored legs. Kingfishers are very brightly colored. The color of their wings is a blue/green color and their upperparts, rump and tail are a bright blue color. Their underparts are bright orange and they have a small, white bib underneath their beaks, on their throats.The kingfishers head is blue with orange marks in front and behind the birds eyes and a white mark on each side of the head. These bright, beautiful colors are more apparent when the bird is in flight.Male kingfishers and female kingfishers are are almost identical except for an orange coloration with a black tip on the lower part of the females beak/mandibles. Young kingfishers are similar to the adults in appearance, however, they have duller and greener upperparts, paler underparts, black beak and initially, black legs.Kingfishers have very keen eyesight. The kingfisher has monocular vision (in which each eye is used separately) in the air and binocular vision (in which both eyes are used together) in water. The underwater vision is not as a sharp as in the air, however, the ability to judge the distance of moving prey is more important than the sharpness of the image.The Common kingfisher has no particular song, however, they vocalize using a shrill \u2018tsee\u2019 or \u2018tsee-tsee\u2019 call. Their flight call is a short sharp whistle, chee, repeated two or three times. Anxious birds emit a harsh, shrit-it-it and nestlings call for food with a churring noise.",
            "kingfisher habitats": "In temperate regions, kingfishers inhabit clear, slow-flowing streams and rivers and lakes with well-vegetated banks. Kingfishers are often found in scrubs and bushes with overhanging branches close to shallow open water in which it hunts. In winter, the kingfisher is more coastal, often feeding in estuaries or harbours and along rocky seashores.",
            "kingfisher diet": " Kingfishers feed on aquatic insects such as dragonfly larvae and water beetles and small fish ranging from 1 inch to 5 inches long, such as sticklebacks, minnows, small roach and trout. About 60% of food items are fish. In winter, kingfishers feed up on crustaceans including freshwater shrimps. The Common Kingfisher hunts from a perch 1 \u2013 2 metres (3 \u2013 6 feet) above the water, on a branch, post or riverbank with its beak pointing downwards as it searches for prey.The Kingfisher bird bobs its head when food is detected to gauge the distance and plunges steeply down to grab its prey usually no deeper than 25 centimetres (19 inches) below the surface of the water.The wings are opened under water and the open eyes are protected by the transparent third eyelid. The bird rises beak-first from the surface and flies back to its perch. At the perch the fish is adjusted until it is held near its tail and beaten against the perch several times. Once dead, the fish is swallowed head-first. A few times each day, a small greyish pellet of fish bones and other indigestible remains is regurgitated.",
            "kingfisher behaviour": "Like all kingfishers, the Common Kingfisher is highly territorial. Since it must eat around 60% of its body weight each day, it is essential to have control over a suitable stretch of river. It is solitary for most of the year, roosting alone in heavy cover. If another kingfisher enters its territory, both birds \u2018display\u2019 from perches and fights may occur. One bird will grab the others beak and try to hold it under water. Pairs form in the autumn but each bird retains a separate territory, generally at least 1 kilometre long.",
            "kingfisher reproduction": "Kingfisher courtship occurs in spring. The male will approach the female with a fish in his beak. He will hold it so that the head of the fish is facing outwards and attempt to feed it to the female. If he is unsuccessful he will simply eat the fish himself. He may have to repeat this feeding behaviour for some time before mating occurs. Kingfishers make burrows in sandy riverbanks. The burrow consists of a horizontal tunnel with a nesting chamber at the end and are usually about a metre long.The female lays about 5 or 7 white, glossy eggs but sometimes will lay up to 10 eggs. The eggs average 1.9 centimetres in breadth, 2.2 centimetres in length and weigh about 4.3 grams, of which 50% is shell. The male and the female share the job of incubating the eggs for about 20 days. Both incubate by day, however, only the female kingfisher incubates by night. The eggs hatch in 19 \u2013 20 days and the young remain in the nest for a further 24 \u2013 25 days, sometimes longer. Once large enough, young birds will come to the burrow entrance to be fed. Two to three broods may be reared in a season.During the breeding season, kingfishers can often be seen hunting around the deep pools that form in the bends of rivers. These locations are rich in the young fish that the kingfishers feed to their young. A hungry brood of a Kingfisher can demand over 100 fish a day from their parents.The early days for the young kingfishers are the most dangerous. About four days after leaving the nests, the fledglings will take their first dives into the water to find prey. Unfortunately, those who will not have learned how to fish by this time may become waterlogged and drown. About only half survive more than a week or two.Very few birds live longer than one breeding season. The oldest kingfisher on record was 21 years of age.",
            "kingfisher conservation status": "Kingfishers are very sensitive to cold weather and a particularly harsh winter can seriously reduce kingfisher populations. Kingfisher populations fluctuate greatly because of this. However, they are not listed by the IUCN Red List."

            "behaviour": "All lizards are ectothermic, which means they need heat from their surroundings to raise their body temperature. Our winter is too cold for them, so they will hibernate generally from October to March. They will often hibernate in groups and sometimes emerge for a brief time during warm spells. In early spring, late autumn and cool summer days the lizards bask in the sun to reach their optimum body temperature, which is about 30\u00b0C. Common lizards are good swimmers and will dive underwater when threatened.",
            "reproduction": "After emerging from hibernation, the males defend breeding territories from other males. The Common lizard mates in April or May. Males take females in their jaws before mating. If the female is not interested, she will bite the male fiercely. The name of the species is derived from its ability to give birth to live young, an adaptation to a cool climate \u2013 but some southern populations are oviparous (egg-laying). The young develop for approximately three months inside the female. The 3 \u2013 10 young (or eggs) are usually produced in July. The young are black in color and measure about 3 centimetres and when first born are surrounded by egg membrane, from which they break free after about a day. Males reach sexual maturity at two years old, females at three years old.The Common Lizards life span is around 5 \u2013 6 years.",

They are also found in Russia and western Asia. The common newt is one of three native newt species. All newts are amphibians. The Common Newt has the widest distribution of our native newts. Common newts measure around 7 \u2013 11 centimetres in length from head to tail. Male and female newts are difficult to tell apart as both are of similar size and have a similar pale brown to yellow coloration. There are only two visible differences in which one can tell them apart.",
            "description": "Common newts measure around 7 \u2013 11 centimetres in length from head to tail. Male and female newts are difficult to tell apart as both are of similar size and have a similar pale brown to yellow coloration. There are only two visible differences in which one can tell them apart.Firstly, the male newt has a single black line running down the centre of the spine, the females have two parallel lines either side of the centre. Secondly, On closer inspection, one can clearly see that the males cloaca (the posterior opening from which they excrete both urine and faeces) is very swollen, whilst the females is nearly invisible.Breeding season is the best time to tell the male from the female common newt. During this period the male develops a wavy, transparent crest along the spine and tail. Each wave is topped by a black mark. The bright orange belly has black spots. Females are smaller and also develops spots, but not on the stomach area, which is paler than the males and their spots are generally smaller. The females do not develop crests. As they grow, Common newts shed their skin once a week. Males are also distinguishable from females by their fringed toes.",
            "habitats": "Common newts can be found in a variety of habitats outside the breeding season, inhabiting deciduous woodland, wet heathland, bogs, marshes, gardens, parks and farmland. They prefer standing water with plenty of weeds, such as lake margins, ponds and ditches, in which to breed.",
            "diet": "Common newts feed upon insects, caterpillars, worms and slugs which is their main diet on land, while in the water, insects, crustaceans, mollusks and tadpoles are eaten. Newts do not use their tongues to catch their prey in the water, instead, they have tiny teeth which they use to grab onto their prey. Newts tend to hunt for their prey near the surface of the water.",
            "behaviour": "Common Newts emerge from hibernation in March, they breed through to May and generally the adult newts leave the water in July. They are one of the most terrestrial of the newts in Europe. When newts surface from the water for air, they make a characteristic \u2018popping\u2019 sound. Newts are nocturnal animals and sleep under stones or compost heaps during the day.",
            "reproduction": "During courtship the male newt \u2018displays\u2019 for his prospective mate by vibrating his tail in front of the female and waft glandular secretions towards her by fanning his tail in her direction. This stimulates the female to approach him. The male then deposits a sperm-containing capsule, known as a spermatophore, in front of his mate, who manoeuvres herself into a position whereby she can pick up the capsule with her cloaca \u2013 fertilization occurring inside the female. After a few days, the female begins to lay eggs individually, usually under aquatic plant leaves at a rate of 7 to 12 eggs per day. Altogether a total of 400 eggs may be produced over the season.After 2 to 3 weeks (depending on water temperature) the eggs hatch to a larval form \u2013 a tadpole. For a few days the tadpoles live off the food reserves contained within their yolk sacs (left over from the egg stage). After this they start to eat freshwater plankton, and later insect larvae and mollusks. Unlike frog tadpoles, newts are carnivorous throughout their life. The larvae have external gills, which absorb oxygen directly from the water. About 10 weeks later they have metamorphosed into air-breathing juveniles. They are known as \u2018efts\u2019 at this time and some may leave the water. They become sexually mature at 3 years of age. The average life span of a newt is 6 years although it is possible for them to survive for 20 years.",
            "conservation status": "Newts are protected in Europe. There are laws prohibiting the killing, destruction and the selling of newts. While the species is by no means endangered, IUCN lists insufficient data to make an assessment for two of the subspecies.In the UK, the Common newt is protected under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981) with respect to sale only. It is therefore illegal to sell individuals of the species, but their destruction or capture is still permitted. They are also listed under Annex III of the Bern Convention. The Common newt is the only newt native to Ireland and it is protected there under the Wildlife Acts [1976 and 2000]. It is an offence to capture or kill a newt in Ireland without a licence."

It is the most studied of all the octopus species. The common octopus is most famous for its eight legs. It is a cosmopolitan species and occurs all over the world, particularly abundant in the Mediterranean Sea, the Eastern Atlantic Ocean, and in Japanese waters. These animals are quite large, and their tentacles can measure up to 1 m (3.3 feet) long. They hunt at dusk and mostly eat crabs, crayfish, and bivalve molluscs. They are able to change their color to blend in with their surroundings and can even adjust their shape to escape predators.",
            "lifespan": "The common octopus has a short lifespan, of between one and two years.",
            "diet": "The common octopus prefers to eat crabs, clams, snails, small fishes, but will actually eat any crustaceans they can catch and will even eat other octopuses. They use their color changing abilities to hide from their prey and will jump out and catch them.Octopuses use their radula to pry open and drill into the shells of prey. Once they break into the shells, they may also inject a paralyzing poison to kill the prey before eating it.",
            "behavior": "The common octopus is a solitary animal that spends most of its time alone in its home. They leave only to hunt for food and to reproduce. They are nocturnal and typically hunt at night.Their preferred mode of movement is to crawl along the seabed. They can also swim at high speeds, propelled by jets of water, which they shoot out of a tube called a siphon. However, when they are swimming, the systemic heart does not beat, so they tire easily.When threatened by prey, the octopus will release a cloud of black ink to obscure its attacker\u2019s view, giving it time to swim away. The ink even contains a substance that dulls a predator\u2019s sense of smell, making the fleeing octopus harder to track.The octopus may also adopt deflective markings to scare away potential predators. The areas around the eyes, suckers, arms, and web may darken so the octopus appears more threatening. Their coloration also reflects their mood. While their pigmentation is normally brown, octopuses may turn white, which shows fear, or red, which demonstrates anger. In addition to changing color, they also adapt the texture of their skin and their body posture to blend in seamlessly with their surroundings.",
            "reproduction": "In early spring, octopuses move closer to the shore to mate. The male initiates mating by approaching the female. She will fend him off for a while, but then accepts him. The male has a specialized tip at the end of one arm that transfers sperm to the female\u2019s oviduct. The male dies soon after mating.After copulation, the female will look for a suitable den site and lays the eggs, attached in chains, to the rock or coral of a den. The eggs are laid in shallow water and are always attached to a substrate. The total number of eggs laid by a female varies from 100,000 to 500,000.The female looks after the eggs after laying them and she usually does not feed during the entire period of spawning and brooding, which can be as long as 4 to 5 months at low temperatures. She spends her time cleaning the eggs, providing oxygen by squirting water, and fending off predators. Because she does not eat, the female dies shortly after the eggs hatch because she has lost so much weight.As soon as they hatch, the young are able to swim, eat, and produce ink. The hatchlings are carried by the currents, and they feed on plankton for 45-60 days. Only one or two of the hatchlings will survive to adulthood.\u00a0Common Octopus Location and HabitatThe common octopus is found all over the world, and is particularly abundant in the Mediterranean Sea, the Eastern Atlantic Ocean, and in Japanese waters. They are found in tropical, subtropical and temperate waters and are benthic, preferring the floor of relatively shallow, rocky, coastal waters, often no deeper than 200 m (660 feet).The temperature of the water in which they reside can vary, but the preferred temperature is about 15 to 16 \u00b0C (59 to 61 \u00b0F). In warmer weather, the octopus can be found deeper in the ocean than usual to escape the warm water.The common octopus spends most of its time in their homes, usually a hole, a crevice or sheltered place which they often protect with shells, stones, and other solid objects they gather. However, they will also swim throughout the water, exposing themselves completely. To do this, they use a jet mechanism that involves creating a much higher pressure in their mantle cavity that allows them to propel themselves through the water.Common Octopus Conservation StatusThe common octopus is not currently considered to be endangered and is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.However, octopus is a common food in Asian and Mediterranean cuisines. People catch octopuses by trawling (fishing with a large net) and by luring them into \u201coctopus pots,\u201d which are plastic traps that octopuses confuse as suitable dens. In the future, overfishing as a result of commercial fishing of octopuses could cause a decline in their population.",
            "predators": "The biggest predators of the common octopus are moray eels, fish, seals, sperm whales, sea otters, and birds. They can evade predators by changing their color to camouflage themselves, squeezing into cracks to hide, darkening their coloration to appear more threatening and using black ink to obscure their predator\u2019s vision so they can swim away.\u00a0Common Octopus FAQsHow many hearts does an octopus have?The common octopus has three hearts. Two peripheral hearts pump blood through the gills, where it picks up oxygen, and a central heart then circulates the oxygenated blood to the rest of the body to provide energy for organs and muscles.How long do octopus live?An octopus usually lives for between one and two years.What does an octopus eat?Adult octopuses eat crabs, clams, snails, small fishes, and even other octopuses. Newly hatched and young octopuses will eat small foods such as copepods, larval crabs, and sea stars.How many brains does an octopus have?An octopus has a staggering nine brains! In addition to the central brain, each of the 8 arms has a mini-brain that allows it to act independently.\u00a0"

The nostrils appear distinctively V-shaped and as with other true seals, there is no ear flap, or pinna (visible part of the ear that resides outside of the head).A relatively large (for a seal) ear canal may be visible behind the eye. Including the head and flippers, they may reach an adult length of 1.85 metres and a weight of 130 kilograms. Female Common Seals are generally smaller than males.",
            "habitat and diet": "Common seals may spend several days at sea and travel up to 50 kilometres in search of feeding grounds and will also swim some distance upstream into freshwater in large rivers. Resting sites may be mud flats, rugged, rocky coasts or sandy beaches. Common Seals may also inhabit fresh water. These seals frequently choose to congregate in harbours, which refers to their other name of \u2018Harbour Seal\u2019.Common Seal feeding habits have been studied closely in many parts of their range. Common Seals are known to prey primarily upon fish such as menhaden (any marine clupeid fish of the genus Brevoortia), anchovy, sea bass, herring, cod, whiting and flatfish and occasionally upon shrimp and squid. Common Seals are able to dive for up to ten minutes, reaching depths of 50 metres (approx 154 feet) or more, but average dives may be 3 minutes long at depths of about 20 metres (approx 66 feet).",
            "behaviour": "While not forming groups as large as some other seals, Common seals are gregarious animals. When not actively feeding, the seals will haul themselves out of the water and onto a preferred resting site. Common Seals tend to hug the coastline, usually not venturing more than 20 kilometres offshore.",
            "reproduction": "Common Seal courtship and mating takes place underwater and females give birth to a single pup. The pup is born in an advanced state of development and can crawl and swim within a few hours of birth. Birthing of pups occurs annually on shore, beginning in February for populations in lower latitudes and as late as July in the subarctic zone.Common Seal mothers are the sole providers of care with lactation lasting 4 to 6 weeks. Males occupy themselves with fights between other males. Suckling for 3 to 4 weeks, pups feed on the mother\u2019s rich, fatty milk and grow rapidly. Born weighing up to 16 kilograms, the pups may double their weight by the time of weaning.Common Seals must spend a great deal of time on shore when molting (shedding of their fur), which the seals do shortly after breeding. This onshore time is important to the life cycle and can sometimes be disturbed when there is substantial human presence.Common Seal females will mate again immediately after the weaning of her pup ends.",
            "life span": "Male common seals have a shorter life span than females, living up to 20 \u2013 25 years as opposed to females living up to 30 \u2013 35 years. This is probably due to the stresses incurred by males during the breeding season.",
            "conservation status": "Common seals are not an endangered species, although their habit of staying in the same area for the majority of the year has meant that some local populations have disappeared. As with most pinnipeds, there is conflict with fishermen.Seals can become entangled and drown in fishing nets and in the UK, Canada and Norway, it is legal to shoot any seals that come near fisheries. It is illegal to commercially hunt common seals, but some hunting for subsistence still occurs."

They are nocturnal and shelter under tree roots, stones and vegetation during the day. They shed their skin regularly and often eat the sloughed skin. Contrary to popular belief, they tend to walk rather than hop. Common toads hibernate in October, typically under deep leaf litter, logs, timber piles, or in burrows and drainpipes. They will occasionally hibernate in mud at the bottom of a pond, but tend to live away from water except during the breeding season. They emerge from hibernation in spring (late March) and migrate to breeding sites.As a defence against predators they secrete a toxic, foul tasting substance called \u2018bufagin\u2019. This is enough to deter many predators although Grass Snakes and hedgehogs are immune. As well as having an unpleasant taste, common toads also adopt a defence posture when threatened that makes them appear much larger than usual and so deters predators. They do this by stretching out their legs, inflating their lungs with air so their body becomes inflated and position their heads downwards. This makes them more difficult to grasp and swallow by a predator.",
            "reproduction": "Although the adults spend most of their time on land, the females enter ponds and other still waters to lay their eggs, toad spawn, which can be distinguished from the spawn of the common frog as it forms strings rather than a large mass of eggs. Although males usually wait for females at breeding sites, they will sometimes try to ambush them before they reach the water. Males clamber onto the backs of females and hold onto them tightly (a posture known as amplexus), the nuptial pads on their fingers providing extra grip. Over-eager males sometimes grab another male, however, the captured males croak soon informs them of their mistake.Common toads spawn amongst waterweed. The female toad releases long strings of triple-stranded eggs, which the male on her back fertilises with sperm. About 600 \u2013 4000 eggs are laid. These strings become twisted and stretched around waterweed and vegetation so that the eggs settle into two strands. A few days later the adults leave the water. The tadpoles hatch within 10 days and despite being distasteful to most predators, the majority will not reach adulthood. The tadpoles metamorphose into toadlets within 2 \u2013 3 months \u2013 varying according to food availability and water temperature. The young tadpoles resemble other tadpoles in their appearance except that toad tadpoles have a larger, rounder blacker head and shorter tail. They leave the water in May. Common toads reach sexual maturity at 4 years of age. The life span of a Common Toad in captivity may be as high as 20 \u2013 40 years, however, in the wild, it is more likely to be 10 \u2013 12 years.",

The eggs hatch out into sterile females called workers. These workers then take over the job of nest building and larvae feeding and the queen continues to lay eggs.Towards the end of the summer the queen lays some more eggs which produce male wasps, called drones and also fertile females which will be the queens of next years nests. These swarm out of the colony and mate.The males die shortly after mating with the new potential queens and the lifecycle starts again."

Until fairly recently, over 600 species of cone snails were all classified under one genus Conus, in the family Conidae. However, in recent years, it was suggested that cone snails should occupy only a subfamily that should be split into a very large number of genera. These species have shells that are more or less conical in shape (hence their common name) and many species have colorful patterning on the shell surface. All cone snails are venomous and capable of \u201cstinging\u201d humans. They can even be fatal when handled live.

These egg capsules remain attached to the substrate before they\u2019re ready to hatch and parents play no role in bringing up the baby cones. Two types of hatchlings have been described, the veligers (free-swimming larvae) and veliconcha (basically baby snails).Cone Snail Location and HabitatCone snails are found in warm and tropical seas and oceans worldwide, including the Indian and Pacific Oceans, southern Australia, Great Barrier Reef, Hawaii, Baja California, and California.They live in tropical and subtropical seas, from the intertidal zone to deeper areas, living on sand or among rocks or coral reefs. When living on sand, these snails bury themselves with only the siphon protruding from the surface. Many tropical cone snails live in or near coral reefs, under rocks in the lower intertidal and shallow subtidal zones and even among mangroves.Cone Snail Conservation StatusCone snails are often taken from their environment because of their interesting shells, which are then used to make necklaces and other jewelry out of. They are also collectables. Some countries have put restrictions on their collection.Medical use of cone snail\u2019s venom is another reason their numbers could decline in the future.

            "venom": "Cone snails are regarded as one of the most venomous species of snails out there. They use their venomous harpoon to sting and deposit venom inside their prey. The venom of cone snails contains hundreds of different compounds, and its exact composition varies widely from one species to another.Humans often pick up these snails because of their bright colors and patterns. However, this can be dangerous, and harpoons of some of the larger species can penetrate gloves or wetsuits.The sting of some of the smaller snails may be no worse than a bee sting or hornet sting, but the sting of some of the larger species can even cause fatalities. Symptoms and side effects of a serious cone snail sting include intense, localized pain, swelling, numbness and tingling and vomiting."

They roam the free water, burrow through the sediment at the bottom of the seas, are found on tidal flats and in the deep sea trenches. At least one third of all species live as associates, commensals or parasites on invertebrates and fishes. One of the hotspots of species diversity are the tropical coral reefs in the Indopacific. Some coral species are hosts to up to 8 copepod species. Like the tidal flats the mangroves teem with copepod life. Species of the Calanoida, Cyclopoida and Harpacticoida have successfully colonised all kinds of freshwater habitats from little creeks to glacier lakes high up in the Himalaya. Although the species diversity in freshwater is not as high as in the sea copepod abundance may sometimes be great enough to stain the water.

The Copperhead Snake is the most often encountered snake in Eastern parts of the United States such as Alabama, Missouri and Arkansas. Copperhead snakes are responsible for the most venomous snake bites in the USA. Copperhead Snake bites are, however, the last line of defence for this and many other venomous snakes. The common names for this group of snakes from the family: Viperidae are Copperhead snakes, chunk head snakes, death adder snakes, (dry-land) moccasin snakes, highland moccasin, narrow-banded copperhead, northern copperhead, pilot snake, poplar leaf snakes, red oak snakes, red snakes, southeastern copperhead, white oak snakes, American copperhead, southern copperhead and cantil cobrizo (Spanish).",
            "copperhead snake characteristics": "Adult Copperhead snakes have a coppery colored head and neck. Copperhead snakes are medium sized snakes, with adults normally reaching 80 centimetres \u2013 1.2 metres (2 \u2013 4 feet), with thick, heavy bodies. Their body is more slender, however, compared to most other pit vipers. There are five clearly defined subspecies. All subspecies have distinctive light and dark brown or greenish banding.Northern copperhead, copperhead, highland moccasin, chunk head, death adder and (dry-land) moccasin have bands that tend to narrow dorsally, giving them an hourglass shape, whereas the others generally have bands of uniform width. Newborn Copperheads are colored and patterned like adults, except the last inch of their tail which is a bright, yellow color.",
            "copperhead snake habitat": "Copperhead snakes can be found in most all habitats, although they often prefer to be near streams and other waterways. Copperhead snakes prefer habitats with lots of vines, vegetation and debris. Their coloration and patterning is very effective for camouflage in dead leaves on the forest floor. Copperhead snakes may be found on hilltops or lowlands. It is not unusual for Copperhead snakes to be found in forested or undeveloped areas within and near suburban developments.Copperhead snakes are often associated with rock outcroppings and ledges, however, they are also found in low-lying swampy regions. In the states, around the Gulf of Mexico, the Copperhead snake is also found in coniferous forest. In the Chihuahuan Desert of west Texas and northern Mexico, it occurs in water habitats, usually near permanent or semi permanent water and sometimes in dry arroyos (also called a wash or draw and is a dry creek bed or gulch that temporarily fills with water after a heavy rain).",
            "copperhead snake behaviour and diet": "The Copperhead snake is one of the most successful of the larger snake species. Copperhead snakes rely upon camouflage and cover for safety when danger is perceived. It is usually not difficult to find a Copperhead snake crossing a road on a warm summer night. Because Copperhead snakes have a habit of freezing at the approach of danger, many are killed by vehicle traffic.When danger is perceived, Copperhead snakes will usually freeze in place and remain motionless for the threat to pass. This strategy works well in their natural habitat. Unless a person steps on them, grasps them or otherwise comes very, very close to them, Copperhead snakes will not usually bite. However, the bite will be readily used as a last defence. An agitated Copperhead snake will vibrate its tail rapidly. The relative abundance of Copperhead snakes and their occurrences near human habitations is the reason bites from Copperhead snakes are at the top of venomous snake bite statistics in the eastern US.The Copperhead snake is venomous, however, their bite is almost never deadly to humans and they are generally non-aggressive. Copperhead snakes have an efficient venom delivery system, with long fangs mounted at the front of the jaw which swivel back to allow the snake to close its mouth.",
            "copperhead snake reproduction": "The Copperhead snake breeds in late summer, however, they do not breed every year. Sometimes a female will produce young for several years running and then will not breed at all for a long period of time. Female Copperhead snakes give birth to live young which measure around 20 centimetres long.A typical litter is 4 to 7, however, it can be as few as one or as many as 20. Apart from their size, the young are similar to the adults, however, they are lighter in color and with a yellow-marked tip to the tail, which is used to lure lizards and frogs.",
            "copperhead snake venom": "The Copperhead snakes have an efficient venom delivery system, with long fangs mounted at the front of the jaw which swivel back to allow the snake to close its mouth.The primary role of the venom and fangs is to kill their food items quickly. The amount of venom a single Copperhead snake can deliver is insufficient to kill an otherwise healthy adult human.Copperhead snakes are capable of, however, producing intense pain, tingling, throbbing, swelling and severe nausea. While rarely lethal, a Copperhead snake bite can be damaging to muscle and bone tissue, especially when the bite occurs in the outer extremities such as the hands and feet, areas in which there is not a large muscle mass to absorb the venom. A bite from any venomous snake should be taken very seriously and immediate medical attention sought.\u00a0"

Native to the southeastern United States, it is the world\u2019s only semiaquatic viper and can be found in or near water. They are large and heavy-bodied, reaching up to 42 inches in length. Cottonmouth snakes, also known as, swamp moccasin, black moccasin, and simply viper, have a dangerous and potentially fatal bite, although these bites are rare. They\u2019re common name is cottonmouths because of the white coloration on the inside of their mouths, which they display when threatened. Let\u2019s take a look at these interesting snakes in further detail below.",
            "what is the lifespan of a water moccasins ( cottonmouth snake )": "Water Moccasin Snakes ( Cottonmouth Snake) have a lifespan of roughly 15 to 20 years, but they can live to over 25 years old.",
            "": "These snakes have a diet that consists mainly of fish, frogs, salamanders, lizards, birds, rodents, and other snakes. They are opportunistic generalists that feed on a wide range of prey, and will eat baby alligators and small mammals. They have even been known to be cannibalistic, but the bulk of their diet consists of fish and frogs.They catch fish by cornering them in shallow water, usually against the bank or under logs. For smaller animals, they can kill with a single, venomous bite, then wrap around their prey until it stops moving before swallowing their food whole. However, with larger animals, they are more cautious about approaching them.Young cottonmouth snakes have a yellowish or greenish tail tip which is wriggled to lure prey, such as frogs and lizards, within striking distance.",
            "behavior": "Cottonmouth snakes are widely thought to be extremely dangerous. Unlike their Copperhead cousins, they will often stand their ground. Their venom is stronger and they tend to be larger snakes, making them very dangerous. However, in reality unless provoked, they will not harm humans. In fact, they\u2019re much more likely to try to escape if encountered rather than attack.When they feel threatened, they coil their bodies and open their mouths wide to show to wide coloration inside their mouths. They may also make themselves stink to deter predators by spraying a foul-smelling musk from glands in the base of their tail, and can quickly vibrate the tip of the tail to produce a buzzing sound, a bit like rattlesnakes.These water snakes can be seen year-round during the day and at night, but they primarily hunt after dark, especially in the summer. They can be found basking in the sun during the day on rocks, logs and stumps. They swim with much of their bodies floating above the surface distinguishing them from water snakes, which tend to swim mostly below the surface, sometimes with their heads protruding.Cottonmouths may hibernate over winter in the colder, northern parts of the US. They spend hibernation in burrows made by other animals, including crayfish and tortoises, or under some other form of cover.",
            "reproduction / mating habits": "Cottonmouth snakes mate in spring, from April to May, and females give birth to live young every two to three years, in litters of about 10 to 20. The gestation period is around five months, and they are ovoviviparous, which means that eggs incubate inside the female.During the mating process, males wave their tails and slither around, sometimes called dancing, to lure females away from other males, and will even fight each other when competing for females.Baby cottonmouths are born brightly colored. They go off on their own as soon as they\u2019re born. Many cottonmouths don\u2019t make it to adulthood because they are eaten by other animals, such as raccoons, cats and snapping turtles.",
            "cottonmouth bite": "Cottonmouth snakes are venomous snakes have a very dangerous bite. If a human is bitten by a cottonmouth, they should seek immediate medical care. Cottonmouth venom is mainly composed of hemotoxins that break down blood cells, preventing the blood from clotting or coagulating. Deaths are rare, but a bite can result in scarring or, in worse cases, amputation. The venom is more toxic than its close cousin the Copperhead snake, however, it is nowhere near as toxic as Rattlesnakes and other vipers.Compared to other venomous snake species in its geographic range, the venom of a Cottonmouth snake is relatively weak and is unlikely to kill an otherwise healthy human adult. The bite however is extremely painful, prone to gangrene and loss of digits without adequate treatment.Fortunately, cottonmouths very rarely bite humans. They have accounted for less than 1% of all snakebite deaths in the US. They are much more likely to try to get away from a human than confront one. However, they will bite if stepped on or provoked in any way.",
            "location and habitat": "Cottonmouth snakes are native to the United States. They are most commonly located in throughout Florida, in every county, and can be found in the Upper Florida Keys and several islands in the Gulf of Mexico in Levy and Franklin. Cottonmouths can also be seen in southeastern Virginia and west to central Texas and north to southern Illinois and Indiana.In fact, there are three subspecies of cottonmouth recognized by the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS). These are Florida cottonmouths (Agkistrodon piscivorus conanti), found throughout Florida; western cottonmouths (Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma), found in the species\u2019 western range, including Indiana, Illinois, Alabama, Oklahoma and Texas; and eastern cottonmouths (Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus), found in Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and southeastern Virginia.Cottonmouths are mainly found in swamps, sloughs, wetlands, and drainage ditches of western coastal plains, but can also be found in rivers and lakes. Because they are semiaquatic, they can be found both on land and in water.Cottonmouth Snakes \u2013 Conservation StatusFortunately, cottonmouths are not considered to be threatened or endangered. The International Union for Conservation of Nature presumes that the cottonmouth population is large and relatively stable, with wide distribution throughout the US. The snake species is categorized as of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.Many cottonmouths live in protected state and national parks and some are protected from being killed in certain states by state laws.\u00a0"

Cows are raised for many reasons including: milk, cheese, other dairy products, also for meat such as beef and veal and materials such as leather hide. In older times they were used as work animals to pull carts and to plow fields. In some countries such as India, cows were classed as sacred animals and were used in religious ceremonies and treated with much respect.",
            "cow reproduction": "The average cow is 2 years old when she has her first calf. Calves are fed from the cow until they are between 8 and 9 weeks old. It is essential for a calf to be fed their mothers milk from the start as it contains antibodies that protect the new calf from diseases. Two months before giving birth, a dairy cow takes a rest from giving milk in order to grow her calf.During this period the cow is known as a Dry Cow. When a dairy cow gives birth, this process is called a freshening. All calves are born with horn nubs. It is common for a vet to remove these nowadays.A young female calf is called a heifer, she is called this until she has her first calf. A young male is called a bull calf.Did you know that cows never forget their calves. It is quite common to see them licking their grown calves just as they did when they were young.",
            "how to determine the age of a cow": "The age of a cow is determined by examination of the teeth and less perfectly by the horns. The temporary teeth are in part erupted at birth and all the incisors are erupted within twenty days. The first, second and third pairs of temporary molars are erupted in thirty days. The teeth have grown large enough to touch each other by the sixth month. They gradually wear and fall in eighteen months. The fourth permanent molars are through at around the fourth month.The fifth at the fifteenth month and the sixth at two years.

They have a tail length of 40 \u2013 60 inches which becomes bushy and is held horizontally when the Coyote displays aggression. Coyotes in the north of their range are generally larger than southern species. Coyotes are known to reach their maximum size within their first year whereas wolves reach their maximum size in their second year.A coyotes fur varies in color from a greyish brown to a yellow/grey color. Their throats and underparts are generally lighter in color, mostly white. They have reddish/brown forelegs, sides of head, muzzle and feet. Their under fur is beige and they have long, black tipped guard hairs that form a black dorsal stripe and a dark cross on the shoulder area. Coyotes have a tail with a black tip on the end. Their tail has a scent gland situated on its\u2019 dorsal base.Coyotes have large ears even though they have a small head and their feet are small in comparison with the rest of their body. Coyotes molt once a year starting in May and ending in July. Like domestic dogs, coyotes have sweat glands on their paws. The coyote has 5 digits on the forefeet, including the dew claw (remnants of a 5th digit) and 4 digits on the hind feet. Coyotes are digitigrades meaning they walk with only their toes touching the ground.",

They feed upon a variety of prey such as voles, squirrels, birds, snakes, javelinas, lizards, deer, mice and livestock as well as large insects and other large invertebrates. Part of the coyotes success as a species is its dietary adaptability. As such, coyotes have been known to eat human rubbish and domestic pets. Fruits and vegetables are a significant part of the coyotes diet in the autumn and winter months. Coyotes will also consume large amounts of carrion (animal carcasses), however, they do prefer fresh meat.",
            "behaviour": "Coyotes are fast animals and can reach speeds of up to 40 \u2013 45 miles per hour and they can jump over 4 metres. Coyotes usually hunt in pairs, however, they have been known to travel in large groups. Coyote packs consist of closely related adults, yearlings and pups. Coyote groups are referred to as either packs, bands or routs. Coyotes were once diurnal animals but have adapted in becoming nocturnal due to human interference.Coyotes can be heard more than they can be seen, Coyote calls are high pitched and are referred to as howls, yelps and barks. Coyote calls are generally heard at dusk and at night but have been heard during the day. The calls are most common during mating season and in the autumn when pups leave to establish their own territories.Coyotes have different hunting techniques whereby when hunting small prey they slowly stalk through grass and use their acute sense of smell to track down prey. When prey is located, they stiffen and pounce on the prey like a cat. Larger prey such as ungulates are attacked from the rear by a pack taking turns to bait and pursue the animal to exhaustion. Coyotes are persistent hunters, with successful attacks sometimes lasting from 14 minutes to about 21 hours. The average distance covered in a nights hunting is 4 kilometres (2 \u2013 3 miles).",
            "reproduction": "Coyote breeding season occurs between late January and late March. Female coyotes are monoestrous (having one estrous cycle per year) and remain on heat for 2 \u2013 5 days. When the female finds the right partner, they remain monogamous (having one partner during a period of time) for a number of years.The female coyote gestation period lasts 60 \u2013 63 days after which a litter ranging from 1 \u2013 19 pups are born (average is 6 pups). Unfortunately, over half coyote pups do not survive to adulthood. Coyote pups weigh around 250 grams at birth and are blind and limp eared. Their eyes open and their ears become erect after 10 days. The pups emerge from their birth dens after 21 \u2013 28 days. They drink their mothers milk for about 5 to 7 weeks and are fully weaned after 35 days.Both parents feed the pups after weaning with regurgitated food. At the age of 6 \u2013 9 months, male pups leave their dens while female pups remain with their parents and form the basis of the pack. Pups are fully grown at the age of 9 \u2013 12 months and also reach sexual maturity although most do not breed until the age of 2 years. The life span of a coyote is up to 10 \u2013 14 years in the wild and 18 years in captivity.",
            "conservation status": "Coyotes are classed as \u2018Least Concern\u2019 by the IUCN. Cougars sometimes kill coyotes.

            "reproduction": "Crab Plovers breed during the months of April to August. Breeding grounds occur around the Arabian Sea of Pakistan, Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf, Red Sea and Somalia. Crab Plovers are colonial breeders and nest in colonies of up to 1500 breeding pairs. These dense colonies form around areas that have an abundance of crabs which can be fed to the young.These mysterious shore birds have very unique breeding habits. Crab Plovers dig deep burrows and networks of interconnected burrows measuring 1.5 \u2013 2.5 metres in sandbanks and dunes along the coast. The burrows are angled downwards and then curve upwards ending in a nest chamber a short distance from the surface. The chamber acts as insulation for the egg against very hot temperatures which occur during the breeding season and as incubation for the egg, keeping it at an optimum temperature and requiring minimum incubation from the parents. Nests can be left for up to 58 hours.The female lays one large, single white egg into the burrow. The large egg provides sufficient energy for the developing chick during the 32 \u2013 33 day incubation period. When the chick hatches, it is well-developed and is able to walk quite quickly although it will remain in the nest for several days after hatching. Food is brought by the parents and is mainly live crabs. Parental care from both parents is continued for a long period of time, even after the chick has fledged.Juvenile Crab Plovers are uniform grey/brown in color, their plumage remains this color for around a year.After the breeding season ends in August, the birds disperse across the Indian Ocean as far as the Andaman Islands and Sri Lanka in the east and Tanzania and Madagascar.",
            "conservation status": "The Crab Plover is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. The Crab Plover is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. Potential threats, however, are the risks of oil spills and the introduction of nest predators. Coastal development and expansion of the tourist industry could also pose threats, however, fortunately most colonies occur on small, isolated and undeveloped islands.",

            "desc": "Crabs are crustaceans and related to lobsters and shrimps. There are almost 5,000 different species of crabs, about 4,500 are true crabs, plus around 500 are hermit crabs (hermit crabs do not have a very hard shell and use other animals old shells for protection). However, crabs have evolved so that they can walk or run sideways, as well as burrow and swim. The body of a crab is covered by a chitinous shell called a carapace. A crabs abdomen has become fairly reduced and is tucked under the body. This reduction is greatest among the \u2018true crabs\u2019, which lack the flaplike tail of the hermit crabs and their allies; instead, the abdomen serves as a brood pouch for the eggs. A crabs segmented body has several pairs of appendages, of which usually five pairs serve as walking legs and two as sensory antennae. The pincers of a crab, called chelae, are located on the front legs and are used for fighting, display and feeding. Crabs can possess fairly complicated nervous systems and are considered to be more advanced. Crabs can live in more extreme areas because of their ability to adapt well to the changing environment."

            "desc": "The Crocodile is a large aquatic reptile that lives throughout the Tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. Crocodiles tend to congregate in freshwater habitats like rivers, lakes, wetlands and sometimes in brackish water (water that is saltier than fresh water, but not as salty as seawater). Some species, particularly the Saltwater Crocodile of Australia, Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands often live along the coastal areas. Crocodiles are also known to venture far out to sea. Crocodiles are an ancient lineage and are believed to have changed little since the time of the dinosaurs.",
            "characteristics": "Crocodiles may look quite prehistoric, however, they are the most advanced reptile of our time. Unlike other reptiles they have a four-chambered heart, diaphragm and cerebral cortex (a structure within the vertebrate brain with distinct structural and functional properties).A crocodiles physical traits allow it to be a successful predator. They have a streamlined body that enables them to swim faster. Crocodiles also tuck their feet to their sides while swimming, which helps the crocodile to swim fast, by decreasing the water resistance.Crocodiles have webbed feet which, although not used to propel the animal through the water, allow it to make fast turns and sudden moves in the water or initiate swimming. Webbed feet are an advantage in shallower water where the crocodiles sometimes move around by walking.Crocodiles are very fast over short distances, even out of water. Crocodiles have extremely powerful jaws capable of biting down with 3,000 pounds of pressure per square inch and sharp teeth for tearing flesh, however, a crocodile cannot open their mouth if it is being held closed. All large crocodiles also have sharp and powerful claws.Crocodiles have limited lateral movement in their neck, therefore, on land protection can be found by getting even a small tree between the crocodiles jaws and oneself.Size greatly varies between species, from the Dwarf Crocodile to the enormous Saltwater Crocodile. Large species can reach over 5 or 6 metres long and weigh well over 1200 kilograms (2,640 pounds). Despite their large adult size, crocodiles start their life at around 20 centimetres long. The largest species of crocodile, also Earths largest reptile, is the Saltwater Crocodile, found in northern Australia and throughout South-east Asia.There is no reliable way of measuring the age of a crocodile, although several techniques can be used to derive a reasonable guess. The most common method is to measure lamellar growth rings in bones and teeth \u2013 each ring corresponds to a change in growth rate which typically occurs once a year between dry and wet seasons.",
            "behaviour and diet": "Crocodiles are ambush hunters, waiting for fish or land animals to come close, then rushing out to attack. As cold-blooded predators, they can survive long periods without food, and rarely need to actively go hunting. Despite their slow appearance, crocodiles are top predators in their environment and various species have been observed attacking and killing sharks. Crocodiles mostly feed on vertebrates like fish, reptiles, and mammals, sometimes with invertebrates like molluscs and crustaceans, depending on species.",
            "reproduction": "The Crocodile breeding season is during January to May. For males, the onset of sexual maturity occurs when they are about 3 metres (10 feet) in length, while for females, it occurs when they reach 2 to 2.5 metres (6.5 to 8 feet) in length. This takes about 10 years for both male and females crocodiles to reach these lengths under normal conditions. During the mating season, males attract females by bellowing, slapping their snouts in the water, blowing water of out their noses and making a variety of vocalizations. The larger males of a population tend to be more successful. Once a female has been attracted, the pair warble and rub the underside of their jaws together.After crocodiles mate, the female crocodile lays about 20 \u2013 40 eggs (a clutch) in a nest she makes near a river bank once a year. She covers the nest with leaves and other vegetation. The rotting vegetation keeps the eggs warm and the nest moist. The incubation temperature for crocodile eggs is 28 \u2013 32 degrees Celsius, relative humidity is 95 \u2013 100 per cent, incubation period is 70 \u2013 80 days. The female stays and guards the nest until the eggs hatch. The hatchlings call out and the female crocodile opens up the nest and carries them to the water, where they immediately start feeding on crabs, shrimps and insects. About half will not survive the first year due to predators.",
            "life span": "The oldest crocodilians are estimated to have lived around 71 years on average and there is limited evidence that some individuals may exceed 100 years. One of the oldest crocodiles recorded died in a zoo in Russia apparently aged 115 years old.",
            "s and humans": "The larger species of crocodiles can be very dangerous to humans. The Saltwater and Nile Crocodiles are the most dangerous, killing hundreds of people each year in parts of South-East Asia and Africa. Mugger crocodiles and possibly the endangered Black Caiman, are also very dangerous to humans.American alligators are less aggressive than crocodiles and rarely assault humans without provocation.Articles that Mention CrocodilesWhat Animals Eat Snakes?Are Crocodiles Dinosaurs?What is a group of Crocodiles Called?Big Five Game Animals of AfricaCrocodile vs Alligator DifferencesTop 15 Deadliest Animals in the World"

The Cuban Solenodon belongs to the family Solenodontidae along with a similar species, the Hispaniolan Solenodon (Solenodon paradoxus). The Cuban Solenodon is unusual among mammals because it has a venomous saliva. The Cuban Solenodon was discovered in 1861 by the German naturalist Wilhelm Peters. Only 36 Cuban Solenodons had ever been caught. By 1970, it was thought that the Cuban Solenodon had become extinct, since no specimens had been found since 1890. On June 2, 1970, the Cuban Solenodon was classified as endangered. Three Cuban Solenodons were captured in 1974 and 1975 and research revealed that it still existed in many places at the eastern end of Cuba. However, the Cuban Solenodon is still very rare. Prior to 2003, the most recent sighting was in 1999 mainly because it is a nocturnal burrower, living underground and it is very rarely seen.",

The Cuban Solenodons obtain food by rooting in the ground with their snouts and by tearing into rotten logs and trees with their fore claws.The Cuban Solenodons have a long life span and low reproductive rate, as a result of having been among the dominant predators before Europeans colonized the New World.",
            "venom": "Cuban Solenodons have venomous bites. The venom is delivered from modified salivary glands via grooves in their second lower incisors.",
            "conservation status": "Although the Cuban Solenodon is not yet extinct, it is still an endangered species because it only breeds a single litter of one to three in a year and because of predation by species that were introduced by humans."

This Caiman also inhabits rivers and small streams in Bolivia (exposed shoreline and around dead wood). Although Cuviers Dwarf Caiman generally prefers clean, faster-flowing stretches of river, it does occur in very nutrient-poor waters in southeastern Brazil and Venezuela.",

Males reach a maximum of 1.5 or 1.6 metres in length and females rarely exceed 1.2 metres in length. Cuviers Dwarf Caimans have heavy, hardened armour on both dorsal and ventral surfaces which is used for protection and which makes up for its small size.The armour reduces injury in more fast-flowing riverine habitats, as well as from obstacles and predators during terrestrial forays which are common in the adults.The Cuviers Dwarf Caiman has one of the most remarkable head shapes of any crocodilian, being short, very smooth and concave (high skull, upturned snout), with a pronounced overlapping of the lower jaw by the upper.\u00a0",
            "cuviers dwarf caiman diet": "The diet of Cuviers Dwarf Caiman is known to be dependent upon the habitat in which the caiman lives. Juveniles eat mainly invertebrates (crustaceans, terrestrial invertebrates such as coleoptera \u2013 beetles), whereas adults include a greater proportion of fish in their diets in addition to a variety of aquatic (e.g. crabs, molluscs, shrimps) and terrestrial invertebrates.The short, backward-curved teeth are particularly suited to taking invertebrates such as crustaceans. Prey also varies depending upon its availability.\u00a0",
            "cuviers dwarf caiman reproduction": "The Cuviers Dwarf Caiman may be found singly or in pairs for most of the year, although no set breeding season has been discovered. Females are mound-nesters, using available vegetation and mud. The mound is usually built under cover, and in a concealed position. Size of the clutch is reported to range from from 10 to 25 eggs and the incubation period lasts around 90 days. Although it has been noted that adults will open the nest and move the juveniles to the water, information on parental care following hatching is lacking and implies that there may be none.Juveniles are brown in color with blank banding. Adults are darker. The Juveniles head is chocolate brown, with an iris color to match. Their lower jaw is flecked with white bands.Newly hatched young may not enter the water until the end of their first day. Until then, they are coated with a slowly-drying, protective mucus layer. Although such a covering is present in the hatchlings of all crocodilians, it has been suggested that the drying of the layer may help to reduce the growth of algae on the body of this species.\u00a0",
            "cuviers dwarf caiman conservation status": "IUCN Red List: LRlc (Low Risk, Least Concern). Estimated wild population: over 1,000,000.Threats come from habitat destruction and pollution (for example, through gold mining activities). Although legal subsistence hunting and collection for the pet trade (commercially in Guyana) reduce crocodile densities in local areas of some countries, there is no evidence that the populations have been significantly depleted in those areas.Extensive survey data are available for this species, usually collected during surveys of other crocodilian species. The data shows that the Cuviers Dwarf Caiman is widespread and relatively stable. There is little incentive for commercial exploitation, such as sustainable-yield management. Improvements in tanning technology and decreasing populations of more suitable species may result in greater levels of exploitation. Despite the information regarding population status, little is known about the biology and ecology of the Cuviers Dwarf Caiman and further research is required in this area."

The adult male makes a very loud and distinct call.L\u2019Hoest\u2019s Monkeys are active during the day, mostly during early morning and late afternoon. They sleep in trees in a sitting position and hold onto branches or each other. When alarmed or see they are being observed they will flee and take shelter in trees becoming very still. They are mostly terrestrial.Breeding is seasonal and depends on the area. After a 5 month gestation period, a single young will be born. The mother usually gives birth at night and where ever she happens to be at the time. Birth usually occurs at the end of the dry season, which allows lactation when rainfall is highest. She will eat the placenta and lick the baby clean while it hangs onto to her belly. The other females in the group show much interest in the newborn and will try to hold it.

Antlers are shed each Spring and immediately a new set starts to grow, taking 16 weeks to reach full size in August. Antlers are made of a type of dense and very solid bone and whilst growing they are covered with a hairy skin called \u2018velvet\u2019 which is shed when the antlers have reached their full size for that year. The buck or stag uses his antlers to fight other males during the mating season, known as the rut, which lasts for three weeks in October. The \u2018rut\u2019 is the period of time when antlered ungulates mate. During the rut (also known as the rutting period), male ungulates often rub their antlers or horns on trees or shrubs, fight with each other and pursue estrus females by their scent. Fallow deer (Dama dama) is a ruminant mammal belonging to the family Cervidae. They are now found throughout much of England and parts of Wales and locally in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Fallow deer were probably first brought to England by the Romans, however, the main introduction was by the Normans in the eleventh century for hunting purposes. Today, Fallow deer are easily tamed and are increasing in number and distributing slowly throughout the parks and forests of Britain. There are now more deer in the South East today than there were 500 years ago. The Fallow deer was a native of most of Europe during the last Interglacial.

Before 1960 they were treated as vermin due to the damage they cause to the forestry industry. Roe deer are found throughout Europe, but they are absent from Ireland, much of Portugal, Greece and large parts of England and Wales. They also inhabit Asia.Sightings of Roe deer have become more common in back gardens in outer suburbs. One of the latest sightings of Roe deer was in a back garden in Brentwood, Essex.The Roe Deer is quite a small deer, with a body length of 95 \u2013 135 centimetres (3.1 \u2013 4.4 feet), a shoulder height of 65 \u2013 75 centimetres (2.1 \u2013 2.5 feet) and weighing 15 \u2013 30 kilograms (33 \u2013 66 pounds).The Roe Deer has rather short, erect antlers and a reddish body with a grey face. Its hide is golden red in summer, darkening to brown or even black in winter, with lighter undersides and a white rump patch.The Roe Deers tail is very short (2 \u2013 3 centimetres (0.8 \u2013 1.2 inches) and barely visible.

The first and second set of antlers are unbranched and short (5 \u2013 12 centimetres (2 \u2013 4.7 inches), while older bucks in good conditions develop antlers up to 20 \u2013 25 centimetres (8 \u2013 10 inches) long with 2 or 3, rarely even four, points. When the males antlers begin to regrow, they are covered in a thin layer of velvet-like fur which disappears later, after the hairs blood supply is lost.Males may speed up the process by rubbing their antlers on trees, so that their antlers are hard and stiff for the duels during the mating season. Roe Deer are the only type of deer that can regrow their antlers during winter.When alarmed, a Roe deer will bark a sound much like a dog and flash out its white rump patch. Rump patches differ between male and female, with the white rump patches heart-shaped on females and kidney-shaped on males.",

Male Red deer grow branching antlers and have long neck hair in their winter coat. The male deer of the British Isles and Norway tend to have the thickest and most noticeable neck manes, compared to the other subspecies.Male deer of all subspecies, however, tend to have stronger and thicker neck muscles than female deer, which may give them an appearance of having neck manes. During the autumn, all Red Deer subspecies grow a thicker coat of hair which helps to insulate them during the winter. Autumn is also when some of the stags grow their neck manes.By the time summer begins, the heavy winter coat has been shed. The Red deers are known to rub against trees and other objects to help remove hair from their bodies. Red Deer have different coloration based on the seasons and types of habitats, with grey or lighter coloration prevalent in the winter and a more reddish and darker coat in the summer.Only the stags have antlers which start growing in the spring and are shed each year, usually at the end of winter. Antlers are made of bone which can grow at a rate of 2.5 centimetres (1 inch) a day. A soft covering known as \u2018velvet\u2019 helps to protect newly forming antlers in the spring.",

            "diet": "Roe deer feed mainly on grass, leaves, berries and young shoots. It particularly likes very young, tender grass with a high moisture content such as grass that has received rain the day before. Roe deer will not generally venture in to a field that either has livestock in it such as sheep and cattle, this is because the livestock will make the grass very unclean.",
            "behaviour": "Male roe deer \u2018bark\u2019 and make a low grunting noise or make a high pitched wolf-like whine when attracting mates during the breeding season, often luring multiple female Roe deer into their territory. Both male and female roe deer are solitary and are highly territorial, with clearly defined boundaries. Both male and female Roe deer scent mark. These scents give information about the sex, age and dominance of the individual.",
            "reproduction": "Roe deer are polygamous which means they have more than one mating partner. Roe Deer males clash over territory in early summer and mate in early fall. During courtship, when the males chase the females, they often flatten the underbrush leaving behind areas of the forest in the shape of a figure eight called \u2018roe rings\u2019. Males may also use their antlers to shovel around fallen foliage and dirt as a way of attracting a mate. Roebucks enter rutting during the July and August breeding season.Female Roe deers are monoestrous (having only one breeding season a year, typically in spring) and after delayed implantation, usually give birth the following June, after a 10 month gestation period. They typically give birth to two spotted kids of opposite sexes. The kids remain hidden in long grass from predators until they are ready to join the rest of the herd. They are suckled by their mother several times a day for around three months.Roe deer adults will often abandon their young if they sense or smell that an animal or human has been near it. Young female roe deer can begin to reproduce when they are around 16 months old. Roe deer have a life span of up to 10 \u2013 12 years.",
            "conservation status": "Roe deer are not an endangered species, despite the fact that up to 90 per cent die during their first year. This is due to heavy predation on fawns by foxes and by lynx in mainland Europe. Starvation and respiratory infections also take their toll."

You could say as long as there has been civilisation, there have been records of humans and dogs. Dogs were domesticated from wolves around 15,000 years ago. New evidence suggests that dogs were first domesticated in East Asia, possibly China. Over time, the dog has developed into hundreds of breeds with a great degree of variation. Dogs, like humans, are highly social animals and this similarity in their overall behavioural pattern accounts for their trainability, playfulnes and ability to fit into human households and social situations.

This similarity has earned dogs a unique position in the realm of interspecies relationships.The loyalty and devotion that dogs demonstrate as part of their natural instincts as pack animals closely mimics the human idea of love and friendship, leading many dog owners to view their pets as full-fledged family members.The common name for the domestic dog is \u2018Canis familiaris\u2018, a species of the dog family \u2018Canidae\u2018. The dog is generally considered the \u2018first\u2019 domesticated animal.Dogs can differ in appearance, function, temperament and size. Some small dogs can weigh as little as 1.5 pounds, whereas some larger dogs can weigh as much as 200 pounds.Depending on the country, there are about 138 officially recognised dog breeds, categorised into 7 different groups.Dogs fill a variety of roles in human society and are often trained as working dogs. For dogs that do not have traditional jobs, a wide range of dog sports provide the opportunity to exhibit their natural skills.",

You must never mistreat a dog at any time as not only is it very wrong to mistreat any animal, but some will bite in their own defense.Larger breeds need considerably more exercise over a larger area than medium sized or small dogs. You can take them out into the countryside or to your local park or recreation ground. Here, they can run about and play games and get the exercise they need to keep them fit and healthy.Dogs can be taught how to do things. Throw a small branch, stick or frizzbee and you can teach your dog to go fetch and bring the item back to you. Dogs have nearly 220 million smell-sensitive cells over an area about the size of a pocket handkerchief (compared to 5 million over an area the size of a postage stamp for humans). Some breeds have been selectively bred for excellence in detecting scents.What information a dog actually detects when he is scenting is not perfectly understood. Although once a matter of debate, it now seems to be well established that dogs can distinguish two different types of scents when trailing an air scent from some person or thing that has recently passed by, as well as a ground scent that remains detectable for a much longer period.If your dog has a flea problem, visit our flea section HERE!\u00a0Dog Classification\u00a0Domain:EukaryotaKingdom:AnimaliaPhylum:ChordataSubphylum:VertebrataClass:MammaliaOrder:CarnivoraFamily:CanidaeGenus:CanisSpecies:C.

Dragonflies are are not actually a fly even though they both have six legs and three body parts, head, thorax and abdomen. The main difference between them is that flies only have two wings whereas dragonflies have four wings. Dragonflies are sometimes confused with Damselflies. Even though they are both members of the same order, they have slight differences whereby when resting, damselflies hold their wings together, a dragonfly holds its wings horizontally or slightly down and forward and their hindwings are broader near the base. The eyes on a damselfly are separated, in most dragonflies the eyes touch. However, being in the same order makes their life cycles quite similar. The Dragonfly name comes from their fierce jaws, which they use to catch their prey.",
            "diet and vision": "All dragonflies are carnivorous in both the larval and adult stages of their lives. Dragonflies typically eat mosquitoes, midges and other small insects like flies, bees and butterflies, catching its prey while it is flying. A Dragonflies ability to manoeuvre in many directions makes them able to out-fly their prey.Dragonflies also have the advantage of excellent eyesight. Each of their two large eyes is made up of thousands of six-sided units. Together, these smaller eyes enable a dragonfly to detect even the slightest movement. They have large optic brain lobes and 80% of their mental processes are devoted to vision and they can detect color, ultraviolet light and polarization.",
            "habitats": "Dragonflies are usually found around water such as lakes, ponds, streams and wetlands because their larvae, known as \u2018nymphs\u2019, are aquatic.",
            "reproduction": "A dragonfly undergoes incomplete metamorphosis. Female dragonflies lay eggs in or near water, often on floating or emergent plants. When laying eggs, some species will submerge themselves completely in order to lay their eggs on a suitable surface. After about two weeks, the eggs hatch and an immature dragonfly, or nymph, emerges. The nymphs are not as attractive as the adults. They have tiny wings and a large lower lip, which they use to catch their prey (often mosquito larvae).\u00a0Dragonfly nymphs live in the water. As they grow, they molt (shed their skin). Nymphs of some species may take as long as three years to mature. Most of a dragonflys life is spent in the larval stage beneath the waters surface, using internal gills to breathe and using extendable jaws to catch other invertebrates or even vertebrates such as tadpoles and fish. The life span ranges from about 6 months to over 7 years (most of it is spent in the nymph stage \u2013 the adult lives for only a few weeks).When the larva is ready to metamorphose into an adult, it climbs up a reed or other emergent plant at night. Exposure to air causes the larvae to begin breathing. The skin splits at a weak spot behind the head and the adult dragonfly crawls out of its old larval skin, waits for the sun to rise, pumps up its wings and flies off to feed on midges and flies.",
            "dragonflies and humans": "Dragonflies do not normally bite or sting humans, although they will bite in order to escape, if grasped by the abdomen. They are valued as predators that help control populations of harmful insects, such as mosquitoes. Dragonflies are one of several insects commonly referred to as \u2018mosquito hawks\u2019 in North America.",
            "history": "The oldest known species of dragonfly is the 320 million year old (Delitzschala bitterfeldensis). Another is \u2018Namurotypus\u2019 an extinct genus of dragonfly. Dragonflies are ancient insects. They were around before the dinosaurs. Ancient dragonflies may have been considerably larger than those we see today. A fossilized impression of a dragonfly wing, found in a coal mine in England, is the oldest known dragonfly specimen. This dragonfly lived 320 million years ago and had a wingspan of 8 inches. The largest known dragonfly had a wingspan of 24 inches (two feet). Today, the largest dragonfly is found in South America and has a wingspan of slightly over seven inches. Other than being smaller, modern-day dragonflies do not look very different from their ancestors.",
            "conservation": "Fifty years ago there were twice as many ponds in Britain as there are today. The draining of agricultural land, filling in and pollution have all contributed to the disappearance of most countryside ponds. Canals have also suffered from pollution, especially by chemicals used on farmland draining into water. The loss of suitable fresh water habitats has affected dragonflies enormously and they are becoming increasingly rare. The Norfolk aeshna, Aeshna isosceles, which can be found living only in the Norfolk Broads, is on the list of Britains endangered species of insects.",
            "helping dragonflies": "Garden ponds have become very popular over recent years and these are helping to save Britains threatened pond-life including dragonflies.

Drywood termites infest dry wood and often establish nests in roof materials and wooden wall supports and can infest dead wood that may be around homes. Drywood termites form colonies of up to 2,500 members. Unlike other termite species, drywood termite colonies don\u2019t have workers. Younger termites, called \u201cfalse workers\u201d, do all the work for the colony. As the termite colony ages, the young termites develop into reproductive termites or soldier termites.

            "drywood termite diet": "Like other species of termites, this species eats cellulose, which is found in wood and other plants. This is what makes wooden structures so appealing to them and why they are found in homes, fences and trees.However, drywood termites eat across the grain which destroys both the soft springwood growth and the harder summerwood growth. Most subterranean termites avoid the harder layers of wood, eating only the softer layers. Because they eat across the grain, the tunnelling can lead to a building or tree collapsing if the colony\u2019s network of tunnels grows too extensive.These termites can chew through support beams, floors and walls, causing expensive home repairs. They\u2019ll also chew through wallpaper, plastics and fabric made from plants. In fact, drywood termites and other termite species cause a collective $5 billion in property damage each year.",
            "drywood termite behavior": "Drywood termites are social insects that form colonies of up to 2,500 members. As with other species of termites, drywood termites are organized in a caste system. This caste system is composed of a king, a queen, soldiers, nymphs, and pseudergates (false workers).Once a queen finds a good spot for a colony, which is often within a home, she chooses a mate (or king) and begins laying eggs. The eggs hatch and join the worker caste that eats wood and cares for the rest of the colony.As the termite colony ages, the termites develop into reproductive termites or soldier termites. Reproductive termites (alates) will grow wings, swarm and go off to form new colonies.They usually swarm on sunny, warm days after a sudden rise in temperature. Soldier termites protect the established colony from ants, other termites and various threats.\u00a0",
            "drywood termite reproduction": "Once alates have swarmed and landed in a new colony, they break off their wings which they do by holding their wingtips against a substrate and turning until the wing breaks off at the base.After this, they are called dealates. Dealates find a mate and engage in courtship activity. A king and queen mate for life.Once eggs have been laid, they hatch into larvae and go through about three molts, the young begin the process of separating into castes. Some molt into presoldiers, which resemble soldiers in form but have a soft body and are white in color.Others become nymphs, which will eventually develop into winged reproductives, or alates. Other larvae molt to become the worker class of the colony, taking care of excavating galleries and keeping the soldiers fed.Drywood termite pseudergates are different from subterranean termite workers in that they can continue to develop into alates should the need arise in the colony.\u00a0Drywood Termite Location and HabitatDrywood termites can be found all over the world. In the United States, drywood termites can be found in a narrow strip that runs roughly from Florida to California. These warm to tropical climates are where wooden structures are plentiful and winters are not severe.Because they don\u2019t need water, these termites are often found in dry wood above ground level, hence their name. The wood they eat provides the moisture they need to survive. They obtain moisture from the water produced by the digestion of cellulose, resulting in a very hard, sand-like fecal pellets.\u00a0Drywood Termite FAQsHow serious are drywood termites?Drywood termite infestations can be limited to one part of the house, or they can be widespread. Either way, their damage can be extensive, as the termites will chew tunnels inside wooden beams or foundations, weakening them from the inside. This can lead to collapse if not taken care of.If you have a drywood termite infestation, you may need to have your house fumigated to prevent any further damage.\u00a0How do I know if I have drywood termites?Drywood termite infestations are identifiable by piles of fecal pellets. These fecal pellets are often first noticed in places like windowsills. Frass is another indication. Frass looks similar to sawdust and is left behind by termites while digging through and consuming wood.A big indication are swarmer wings. This shows the swarmer termites being active in mating and creating a new colony within the home. Finding wings is a tell-tale sign that you have a heavy infestation.Many people only notice a drywood termite infestation for the first time when the termites swarm.\u00a0What do I prevent drywood termites?The best way to prevent drywood termites is to seal all cracks and crevices around the outside of your home. Putting a mesh screen on doors, windows, vents and openings will also help, especially ones that lead to attics and crawl spaces. You should also make sure all firewood and scrap wood is stored away from your house.\u00a0What do drywood termites eat?Drywood termites eats cellulose, which is found in wood. Therefore, they are very likely to inhabit wooden areas within a home, such as beams, floors and walls, and also pieces of furniture.\u00a0How do I get rid of drywood termites?The simplest way to get rid of drywood termites is to remove and replace infested wood. If the infestation is localized to one or two pieces of easily accessible wood, you can simply remove and replace the infested wood to effectively get rid of drywood termites in your home.If this isn\u2019t an option, you can treat the wood with a borate-based product, such as Bora-Care. You can use insecticide, too.However, the best solution we recommend if you discover you have a drywood infestation is to call a professional. They will be able to identify where the infestation is and treat it effectively.Drywood Termite SpeciesThere are 419 drywood termite species. Here are some of the most common drywood termite species and their scientific names, some of which also have common names.Light western drywood termiteGenus: MarginitermesSpecies: Marginitermes hubbardiThe light western drywood termite is found in Central America and desert regions of southwestern North America. It is normally found below 4,000 m (13,000 ft) and inhabits trees such as cottonwoods in canyons and near riverbeds.This termite gets its common name because they are much paler in color than those of Incisitermes minor, the dark western drywood termite. This termite is around 0.5 in (13 mm) long and a yellowish color with pale wings.Yellownecked drywood termiteGenus: KalotermesSpecies: Kalotermes flavicollisThe yellownecked drywood termite is found in France, Italy, Greece, Slovenia, Spain, in the Near East, Ecuador and in North Africa, quite close to the sea coast in warmer temperatures. The adults reach 8 to 10 millimetres (0.31 to 0.39 in) of length, with a wingspan of about 20 millimetres (0.79 in). The basic coloration of their body is pale yellow or dark brown. Their pronotum is yellow-orange, hence their name.Western drywood termiteGenus: IncisitermesSpecies: Incisitermes minorThe western drywood termite is native to western North America, including the western United States and northern Mexico, but has also been found in many other parts of the United States, all the way to the East Coast, in Hawaii, in Toronto and in China and Japan. They are adapted to the Mediterranean climate of their native range in California and the surrounding regions, and are often found in plants such as roses, avocado, citrus and elderberry.These termites are dark brown and have an orange head.

There is a great variation in size depending on the region in which the Platypus lives, and this pattern does not seem to follow any particular climate rule and may be due to other environmental factors such as predation and human residence. The Platypus has extra bones in the shoulder girdle which are not found in any other mammals.",
            "platypus communication": "Platypuses are Monotremes, the only mammals known to have a sense of electro reception (the ability to receive and make use of electrical impulses). Their electro reception is the most sensitive of any monotreme. The electro receptors of the Platypus are located in rostro-caudal rows in the skin of the bill.The Platypus can determine the direction of an electric source, perhaps by comparing differences in signal strength across the sheet of electro receptors. This would explain the anima\u2019s characteristic side-to-side motion of its head while hunting.The Platypus feeds by digging in the bottom of streams with its bill. The electro receptors could be used to distinguish live and dead objects in this situation. When disturbed, its prey would generate tiny electrical currents in their muscular contractions which the sensitive electro receptors of the Platypus could detect. Experiments have shown that the Platypus will even react to an \u2018artificial shrimp\u2019 if a small electrical current is passed through it.",
            "platypus diet": "Platypus are carnivores (meat-eaters) and they use their bill to strain its tiny prey, like crayfish, worms, insects, snails and shrimp from muddy water. The Duck-billed Platypus can store food in cheek pouches while it is hunting underwater.",
            "platypus habitat": "Duck-billed Platypuses live in burrows and spend much of their time in freshwater ponds and streams.The Platypus is generally regarded as nocturnal and crepuscular (animals that are primarily active during the twilight), but individuals are also active during the day, particularly when the sky is overcast. It tends to habitat bridges rivers and the riparian zone (the interface between land and a flowing surface water body) for both a food supply of prey species and banks where it can dig resting and nesting burrows. It may have a range of up to 7 kilometres (4.4 miles) with males home ranges overlapping with those of 3 or 4 females.",
            "platypus reproduction": "Together with the four species of echidna, the Duck-billed Platypus is one of the five extant species of monotremes, the only mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. After an egg hatches, the tiny baby platypus (called a puggle) drinks its mothers milk, which comes from tiny openings in the mothers belly. Duck-billed Platypuses have a life span of 10 \u2013 17 years.",
            "platypus venom": "The male Platypus has venomous ankle spurs which produce a cocktail of venom, composed largely of defensin-like proteins (DLPs), which is unique to the Platypus. Although powerful enough to kill smaller animals, the venom is not lethal to humans, but does produce excruciating pain. So intense is the pain that the victim may be immobilized. Swelling rapidly develops around the wound and gradually spreads throughout the affected limb. The pain develops into a long-lasting hyperalgesia (an extreme sensitivity to pain) that persists for days or even months. Venom is produced in the crural glands of the male, which are kidney-shaped alveolar glands (general anatomical term for a concave cavity) connected by a thin-walled duct to a calcaneus spur on each hind limb. The female Platypus, in common with echidnas (the only surviving monotremes apart from the Platypus), has rudimentary spur buds which do not develop (dropping off before the end of their first year) and lack functional crural glands.The venom appears to have a different function from those produced by non-mammalian species. The venoms effects are non-life threatening but nevertheless powerful enough to seriously impair the victim. Since only males produce venom and production rises during the breeding season it is thought that it is used as an offensive weapon to assert dominance during this period.",
            "platypus conservation status": "Until the early 20th century the Duck-billed Platypus was hunted for its fur, however, it is now protected throughout its range. Although captive breeding programs have had only limited success and the Platypus is vulnerable to the effects of pollution, it is not under any immediate threat.Cuban Solenodon | The Duck-billed Platypus | Eurasian water shrew | Northern Short-tailed Shrew | Southern Short-tailed Shrew"

            "desc": "Ducks are birds. Ducks are also called \u2018Waterfowl\u2019 because they are normally found in places where there is water like ponds, streams and rivers. Ducks are related to Geese and Swans in the Anatidae family. Ducks are sometimes confused with several types of unrelated water birds with similar forms, such as loons (an aquatic bird found in many parts of North America and northern Europe) or grebes (freshwater diving birds) and coots (medium-sized water birds which are members of the Rail Bird family). Ducks are smaller than than their relatives (swans and geese). Ducks also have shorter necks and wings and a stout body.",
            "duck characteristics": "Ducks are smaller than than their relatives (swans and geese). Ducks also have shorter necks and wings and a stout body.A female duck is called a \u2018hen\u2019, they are identified by their very-dull, brown feathers. The females have dull-brown feathers so that they can hide from enemies and predators. They can also camouflage themselves in their nests and also protect their young.A male duck is called a \u2018drake\u2019, you can identify the male duck by its brightly colored feathers. They use these colored feathers to attract the female ducks for mating. Here is a beautifully colored Drake with a purple plumage, shiny green head coloring, silvery white body and grey wings with blue markings.The males use their colorful plumage to attract females. However, they will lose or molt their colorful feathers when the females are busy hatching the eggs. The males will now look like the female in color and will be unable to fly temporarily. They will molt again in early Autumn and get back their colorful feathers and be able to fly again. The females also molt. They replace all their feathers and get new ones after their ducklings are hatched.Ducks have webbed feet, which are designed for swimming. Their webbed feet act like paddles for the ducks. The reason ducks can swim in cold water is their amazing circulatory system. Their blood vessels are laid out very close to each other in their legs and feet in a network that allows the warm and cool blood to exchange heat.This allows the warm blood going from the body into the feet to warm the cooler blood re-entering the body from the feet, and the blood going to the feet is cooled enough that the cold does not bother the duck. Thus the duck\u2019s feet are able to tolerate the cold and not bother them. All birds have this circulatory system in their legs and feet.A duck has water-proof feathers. There is a special gland called the \u2018Preen Gland\u2019 near the ducks tail. This tiny gland produces oil which the duck uses to coat its feathers.The duck picks up the oil with its head and beak, and then smears it all over its body to make the outer feathers waterproof. Without this protective barrier, a ducks feathers would become water-logged and because they spend their whole lives around and in water, this water-proof barrier is extremely important. Beneath the water-proof coat are fluffy and soft feathers which keep the duck warm.The ducks mouth is called a beak or bill. It is usually broad and flat and has rows of fine notches along the edge called \u2018lamellae\u2019. The lamellae helps the duck to grip its food so that it will not slip off.However, ducks beak comes in different shapes and sizes. The shape of the beak and body determines how the duck will hunt for its food.",
            "duck behaviour": "Ducks keep clean by preening themselves. Ducks do this by putting their heads in funny positions and putting their beaks into their body. Ducks preen themselves very often. Preening also removes parasites, removes scales which cover newly sprouting feathers and also involves the removal of spreading oil over clean feathers.",
            "duck habitats": "Many species of duck are temporarily flightless while moulting. Ducks seek out protected habitats with a good food supply during this period. They usually moult before migrating.Ducks are found in wetlands, marshes, ponds, rivers, lakes and oceans. This is because ducks love the water. Some species of ducks migrate or travel longs distances every year to breed. Ducks usually travel to warmer areas or where the water does not freeze so that they can rest and raise their young. The distance may be thousands of miles away. Ducks are found everywhere in the world except the Antartica which is too cold for them.",
            "duck life span": "Ducks can live from 2 \u2013 20 years, depending on species and whether they are wild ducks or ducks in captivity. Its a fact that a wild duck can live 20 years or more. Domestic ducks typically live 10 \u2013 15 years in captivity. The world record is a Mallard Drake that lived to a ripe old age of 27 years.",
            "and their feeding habits": "Shovelers \u2013 these ducks have broad beaks and sift their food for insects, nails and seed from the mud.Diving ducks and Sea ducks forage deep underwater. To be able to submerge more easily, the diving ducks are heavier than dabbling ducks and therefore have more difficulty taking off to fly. These ducks have long and narrow beaks. Their narrow beaks are also covered will saw-like edges which help them to grab fish.Dabbling ducks feed on the surface of water or on land, or as deep as they can reach by up-ending without completely submerging. Their beaks are broad and short. Dabbling ducks have tiny rows of plates along the inside of the beak called \u2018lamellae\u2019 like a whales baleen.These let them filter water out of the side of their beaks and keep food inside. Dabbling ducks eat plants, seeds, grasses and other small insects and animals that they find on or under the water. Usually they stick their tails in the air and stretch their heads into the water to reach their food.Dabblers usually have shiny colored patches on their wings. The domestic ducks are dabblers too. They are descendants of the Mallards. Dabbling ducks take off from the water in quick jumps. Ducks with longer necks dive with their head down into the shallow water and pick up their food.",
            "duck reproduction": "Ducks usually look for a mate or partner in winter. Male ducks will attract the female ducks with their colorful plumage or feathers. The female ducks will then lead the male ducks to their breeding ground in spring. The breeding ground will usually be the place where the female duck was hatched. The female duck builds her nest with grass or reeds or even in a hole in a tree.The male duck will guard their territory by chasing away other couples. Once the female lays 5 \u2013 12 eggs, she will sit on her eggs to keep them warm so that they can hatch into ducklings. The male ducks on the other hand, will be with the other male ducks.The eggs will hatch within 28 days normally, except for the Muscovy duck which takes about 35 days to hatch.The mother duck will keep her brood of ducklings together to protect them from predators. Animals like the raccoon, turtles, hawks, large fish and snakes are a ducks main predators and they will eat the ducklings. Ducklings are able to fly within 5 \u2013 8 weeks. Their feathers develop very fast.When the young are ready to fly, all the ducks will gather in flocks on large lakes, marshes or the ocean to migrate to their wintering home. When the ducks fly, they usually do so in a \u2018V-shaped\u2019 or a long line.",
            "interesting duck facts": "A hen makes a loud QUACK sound while the drake has a raspy, muffled call.Touching a duckling does not prevent the mother duck from taking care of it. It is however best to leave ducklings alone so as not to scare the mother duck away or accidentally injure them.Ducks sleep with half their brains awake. Ducks are more likely to sleep with one eye open when they are located on the edge of sleeping groups. Ducks can detect predators in less than a second.Duck eggshells have tiny holes (pores) that allow it to breathe. A hen\u2019s eggs can have 7500 pores, most found at the blunt end of the egg. Respiratory gasses as well as water vapour travel through these pores allowing the egg to breathe.Baby ducks are precocial meaning they are born with their eyes wide open, with a warm layer of down and are not fully dependant on their parents for food. Ducklings are ready to leave the nest within hours of hatching.A \u2018clutch\u2019 is the total number of eggs laid by one bird during one nesting session.

            "desc": "Earthworms are made up of many small segments known as \u2018annuli\u2019. These annuli are ridged and covered in minute hairs that grip the soil allowing the worm to move as it contracts its muscles. At about a third of the worms length is a smooth band known as the clitellum. The clitellum is responsible for secreting the sticky clear mucus that covers the worm. Earthworms vary in size from 90 \u2013 300 millimetres. Earthworms help to fertilise the soil by bringing nutrients closer to the surface. Earthworms are widespread in Britain and Europe. They have been introduced to most parts of the world. They live in soil at depths of up to 2 metres and feed on decaying organic matter in the soil. Earthworms move slowly underground feeding on decaying organic matter in the soil. They excrete digested material as worm casts and these can be seen as squiggly clumps of mud at the surface of the soil. These castings are very rich in nutrients because they contain minerals and nutrients that have been brought closer to the surface by the worms.",
            "earth worm reproduction": "Earthworms are hermaphrodite and have both male and female reproductive cells. They cannot self-fertilise, however, and must find a mate to exchange sperm cells with. Earthworms reach sexual maturity at about 4 weeks old. This species comes to the surface to mate. Copulation, which may take up to an hour, involves two worms lying together with their heads pointing in opposite directions. While mating, the worms seem to shut out all other external stimuli and do not respond to light or touch. Large amounts of mucus are released by both individuals and while closely pressed against one another, sperm is exchanged. After this is complete the worms separate.After mating the clitellum begins to secrete a substance which hardens to form a ring-like cocoon, into which the worms own eggs and its partners sperm are placed. The 2 millimetre cocoon eventually slips off the worms head end and closes, becoming lemon-shaped. Fertilisation occurs inside the cocoon. This elaborate procedure is designed to prevent self-fertilisation.",
            "earth worm regeneration": "Earthworms have the facility to replace or replicate lost segments, but this ability varies between species and depends on the extent of the damage.It is a commonly held belief that if you chop a worm in half you will end up with two live worms. This is not true. If you chop a worm in half it is possible that one half may recover and heal but you are most likely to end up with two halves of a dead worm.",
            "earth worm behaviour": "You often see earthworms come to the surface in large numbers after a rainstorm. There are three theories for this behaviour.The first is that the waterlogged soil has insufficient oxygen for the worms, therefore, earthworms come to the surface to get the oxygen they need and breathe more easily. However, earthworms can survive underwater for several weeks if there is oxygen in it, so this theory is rejected by some.Secondly, some species come to the surface to mate. This behaviour is, however, limited to a few species.Thirdly, the worms may be using the moist conditions on the surface to travel more quickly than they can underground, thus colonizing new areas more quickly. Since the relative humidity is higher during and after rain, they do not become dehydrated. This is a dangerous activity in the daytime, since earthworms die quickly when exposed to direct sunlight with its strong UV content, and are more vulnerable to predators such as birds.",

Adult males stand 175 centimetres (69 inches) tall and weigh 165 kilograms (360 pounds). Male Eastern Lowland Gorillas are almost twice as large as females.",
            "eastern lowland gorilla behaviour": "The Eastern Lowland Gorilla has a well developed social structure and they live and travel in family groups. Each family group usually includes a dominant silverback male gorilla, three unrelated adult female gorillas and four or five young gorillas. Subordinate male gorillas may also be found in the groups. Larger groups of 15 \u2013 20 members and even up to 30 members, have also been recorded.Female Eastern Lowland Gorillas leave their birth groups to join other groups or single male gorillas when they reach sexual maturity at around 7 or 8 years of age. The bonds between these unrelated adult female gorillas are loose and only related female gorillas (e.g. mother/daughter, sisters) will groom one another.",
            "eastern lowland gorilla reproduction": "Male Eastern Lowland Gorillas mature later than female Eastern Lowland Gorillas and do not breed until 15 to 20 years of age. About half of all male gorillas leave their natal group at puberty and travel alone or with other subordinate male gorillas until they establish their own group. Once a male gorilla has established a group, he will most likely stay with that group for life unless he is ousted by another male gorilla. Fights for access to female gorillas among dominant silverbacks and lone males are intense and may result in death.Adult female gorillas give birth to one baby about every 4 years although a surviving infant is produced only every 6 to 8 years due to high infant mortality in the first 3 years of life. A baby gorilla is born weighing 1.8 \u2013 2 kilograms (4 \u2013 4.4 pounds) after a gestation period of 251 \u2013 295 days. Baby gorillas are carried around by their mothers and begin to walk after 30 \u2013 40 weeks. Gorilla infants are breast feed for about 12 months. The baby gorilla can crawl at around 9 weeks old and can walk at about 35 weeks old. Infant gorillas normally stay with their mother for 3 to 4 years and mature at around 11 to 12 years old. Infant gorillas are weaned at 2.5 to 3 years of age.",
            "eastern lowland gorilla life cycle": "The frequency and duration of sexual activity in gorillas are low in comparison to other great apes. Only the silverback, or dominant male gorilla, is allowed to mate with the adult female gorillas in his group. The reproductive success of males depends upon the maintenance of exclusive rights to adult females, which is ensured by males forming a permanent bond with each female gorilla in a social group. The formation of these bonds keeps adult female gorillas from leaving the group or mating with other male gorillas. Normally quiet animals, gorillas are unusually loud during copulation (mating). Gorillas live 30 \u2013 40 years in the wild; 40 \u2013 60 years in captivity.",
            "eastern lowland gorilla diet": "Eastern Lowland Gorillas mostly eat leaves and other vegetation rather than fruit. Eastern Lowland Gorillas normally feed during the morning and afternoon and rest around midday. They make nests of branches and leaves at night and scientists use nest and scat information collected from these sites to estimate the number of gorillas in a group and to determine their diet.",

Behind the ears, there is a slight reddish color.These differences in attributes are thought to be a result of their Red Wolf ancestry. The Eastern Wolf is also more slender than the Grey Wolf and displays a coyote-like appearance.This is because wolves and coyotes often mate and breed hybrid wolf/coyote pups in the Canadian Parks.

The Northern Elephant Seal (Mirounga angustirostris) and the Southern Elephant Seal (Mirounga leonina) were both hunted nearly to extinction by the end of the nineteenth century, however, numbers have since recovered. The Northern elephant seal, somewhat smaller than its southern relative, ranges over the Pacific coast of the U.S. and Mexico, while the Southern Elephant Seal is found in the southern hemisphere on islands such as South Georgia, Macquarie Island and on the coasts of New Zealand, South Africa and Argentina in the Peninsula Vald\u00e9s which is the fourth largest elephant seal colony in the world and the only growing population. ",
            "characteristics": "The Elephant seal gets its name for being very large and having a nose with a small trunk-like proboscis. Males, also called bulls, use these trunks to fight for breeding rights. The elephant seals can barely move on land because of their heavy weight however, flippers make these creatures swift and powerful swimmers, but they are not strong enough to lift their body off the ground. Large fishes, squid and an occasional penguin fall prey to elephant seals, who have few, if any predators. Beach parties of hundreds of seals sunbathe on the shores together.The Elephant seals nose is used in producing extraordinarily loud roaring noises, especially during the mating season. The largest known bull elephant seal was 6.7 metres in length and weighed 3400 kilograms (about four tons). Therefore the Elephant seal is one of the largest members of the order Carnivora.Elephant seals are shielded from cold by their blubber, much more than by fur. The skin on top of this blubber and its hair molts. It has to be re-grown by blood vessels reaching through the blubber. When this process is occurring, the seal is susceptible to the cold, and must rest and molt on land, in a safe place called a \u2018haul-out\u2019. The type of molt which an elephant seal undergoes is a catastrophic molt. While this is taking place, the bulls actually cease fighting with one another.",
            "habitat and diet": "The elephant seal is almost entirely aquatic, coming ashore primarily to breed. Its range is mostly in warm waters. Elephant seals presumably feed in deep water and eat squid, and fish, including small sharks and rays. They can fast as long as 3 months.",
            "behaviour": "The elephant seal is a powerful swimmer and well adapted to an aquatic life. The seals may be solitary at sea, but become very social on the beach. Even during nonbreeding times of the year, they will lie close together on the sand. The males arrive at rookery sites in early December and remain throughout the breeding season without going to sea to feed. Because they move slowly and awkwardly on land, the males cannot defend large territories or large numbers of females. Unlike other seals, which may have harems averaging 40 cows, a dominant bull elephant seal may have only a dozen cows within his territory.Elephant seals spend an unusual amount of time in the ocean, up to 80% of their lives. Elephant seals can hold their breath for over 80 minutes, longer than any other non-cetacean mammal. Furthermore, elephant seals are incredible divers as well, with an ability to dive to 1500 metres beneath the oceans surface. The average depth of their dives is about 300 to 600 metres, as they search for their favourite food.",
            "reproduction": "The female Elephant seals arrive at the rookeries (breeding grounds) in late December. Elephant seals give birth within a week, usually to a single pup. Gestation lasts about 350 days. The greatest threat to the young pups is the heavy-bodied adult males, which totally ignore the presence of the pups and sometimes crush them. Female Elephant seals will bite and sometimes kill pups that are not their own.",
            "life span": "Female Elephant seals have an average life expectancy of about 20 years, and can give birth starting at the age of 3 \u2013 4. Males reach maturity at 5 years, but generally do not achieve alpha status until the age of 8, with the prime breeding years being between ages 9 and 12. The average life expectancy of a male elephant seal is 14 years.",
            "conservation status": "During the nineteenth century, Elephant seals were hunted to near extinction and the entire population of Northern elephant seals was reduced to a small herd of less than 100 individuals on Isla de Guadalupe. The protection of this species during the twentieth century resulted in a gradual recovery, and the population spread north to other islands and some mainland beaches.

Their traditional common English name \u201celephant shrew\u201d comes from a perceived resemblance between their long noses and the trunk of an elephant, and their superficial similarity with shrews (family Soricidae) in the order Eulipotyphla. However, phylogenetic analysis revealed that elephant shrews are more closely related to elephants than shrews. The common name of sengis helps disassociate them from the true shrews (order Soricomorpha, family Soricidae) and the treeshrews (order Scandentia). Recent evidence suggests that elephant shrews may belong to a clade of African mammals, the Afrotheria, which also includes hyraxes, elephants, sea cows, aardvarks, golden moles, and tenrecs. Living members of the family are characterized by a rodent or opossum like appearance, with hind limbs longer than forelimbs, elongated snouts, relatively large eyes and ears, complete auditory bullae, and upper canines with two roots.",
            "lifespan": "In the wild, elephant shrews can live between one to five years. However, they have been known to live up to eight years old in captivity.",
            "diet": "Elephant shrews are primarily insectivores and eat ants, termites, earthworms, spiders, centipedes, and millipedes. However, they will also sometimes eat leaves, fruits, and seeds.To hunt, the elephant shrew uses its nose together with its paws to clear away small paths on the ground in order to lure insects close. They also use their long and skinny tongues to help them catch their food. If their prey is too big, they will pin their prey to the ground with a forefoot.Elephant shrews have a very good sense of smell and excellent sight and hearing, all of which help them when hunting.",
            "behavior": "Elephant shrews are diurnal, meaning they are awake during the day and sleep at night. They are very active animals and spend most of their days looking for food.They are not very sociable animals, and most commonly spend their lives in pairs. They are monogamous and made for life, and a pair will share and defend a home territory they mark using scent glands. Monogamous pairs tend to defend their home sex-specifically \u2014 females tend to drive away other females, while males try to ward off other males. Although they live in pairs, the partners do not care much for each other and their sole purpose of even associating with the opposite sex is for reproduction.Elephant shrews can also be solitary, or may live in small groups. They are one of the fastest small mammals, having been recorded to reach speeds of 28.8 kilometres per hour (17.9 mph).",
            "reproduction": "While most elephant shrews are monogamous and mate for life, living with their partner, some solitary species stay together for several days, mate, and then go their separate ways.Some may also not be strictly monogamous, but mate with other individuals while maintaining their pair relationshipFemale elephant shrews undergo a menstrual cycle that is similar to that of human females and the species is one of the few nonprimate mammals to do so.Their mating period lasts several days females and female elephant shrews have four to six mammae, although will usually bear litters of one to three young several times a year, after a 45 to 60 day gestation period.The young are born relatively well developed, being able to run within a few hours, but remain in the nest for several days before venturing outside.After five days, the young\u2019s milk diet is supplemented with mashed insects, which are collected and transported in the cheek pouches of the female.Babies are weaned from their mothers within a week of birth, and they are ready to explore their surroundings and migrate away from the nest by day 15.After about 45 days, the young elephant shrews will become sexually active and establish their own nests far away from their parents.",
            "location and habitat": "Elephant shrews are widely distributed in Africa, with the exception of western Africa and the Sahara region. Their distribution includes the island of Zanzibar but not Madagascar.They can be found in the stone deserts, savannas, and arid steppes of the continent. In fact, they are known to thrive in the Namib Desert, which is famous for being one of the driest places in the world. They can also be found in the tropical forests of East Africa as well.Different species are found in different areas of Africa. For example, the Macroscelides genus is found only in southwestern Africa, while most Elephantuuls species are found in southern Africa and eastern Africa. Members of Rhynchocyon are found in eastern and central Africa.\u00a0Conservation StatusElephant shrews are generally considered to be an endangered animal. The two species of these shrews that are considered the most threatened are the gray-faced sengi, which was only discovered in 2005, and the golden-rumped elephant shrew, which is officially listed as endangered.The biggest threat to the elephant shrew is loss of habitat. Deforestation will affect elephant shrew populations, as it will affect their ecosystem and their ability to find food and disguise themselves from predators.",
            "predators": "Unfortunately, due to their small size, elephant shrews are at risk from a number of predators. The most common predators of the elephant shrew are snakes, lizards and birds, but most carnivorous or omnivorous type of animal would most likely prey on this animal.The elephant shrew is, however, well adapted to their habitat to help them escape from predators. Their coloring helps them to camouflage against their habitat, and they\u2019re also very quick moving animals. When needed, they can move up to 18 miles per hour and leap three feet into the air!\u00a0",

            "desc": "The word Elephant in latin (as \u2018ele\u2019 and \u2018phant\u2019) means the \u2018Huge Arch\u2019. Most elephants live in the grasslands of Africa and in the forests of Asia although elephants can live in nearly any habitat that has adequate quantities of food and water. Elephants live in groups called \u2018herds\u2019. The herd is usually made up of ten females and their young.  All of the females in the herd are directly related to the matriarch, who is typically the oldest and largest female. There are two species of elephant \u2013 the African elephant and the Asian elephant. The African is the larger of the two and weighs up to 6 tons. Regardless of where elephants live, their social behaviours and social structures remain largely the same. The African elephant and the Asian elephant are the only two surviving species of what was in prehistoric times a diverse and populous group of large mammals. While Asian elephants and African elephants have a lot in common, they differ slightly in appearance and each faces different threats to its survival.",
            "elephant behaviour": "Elephants are amazing creatures. They cry, play, laugh and have incredible memories. Elephants are sensitive to fellow animals where even if a baby elephant complains, the entire family of elephants will rumble and go over to touch and care for it.Male elephants beyond the age of maturity are with the herd only during mating. Herds have been known to travel ten miles or more to look for food and water. When elephants travel, they walk very quietly in single file. Young elephants (calves) are led by the older elephants with their tails. Elephant calves stay close to their mothers at all times. The entire herd will protect the young ones if there is any sign of danger. A herd ambles along at about 4 miles per hour and can charge at more than 25 miles per hour. Elephants cannot run or jump. They can however, walk very fast and climb.Elephants smell, drink, eat and wash themselves with their long trunks. Elephants have tusks that are long teeth made of ivory. Their tusks help them get food and carry heavy objects. All elephants do not have tusks. Only the male Asian elephants have tusks whereas the male and female African elephants both have tusks.Elephants love water and are very good swimmers. When elephants get hot, they swim in lakes or rivers, or give themselves showers using their long trunks. An elephant can also cool off by rolling in a shady bed of mud.Elephants can swim considerable distances. In deep water they hold their trunks above the water like periscopes. Elephants also use their trunks to trumpet.Elephants can live to be a good age. On average, an elephant lives between 50 and 70 years although the oldest living elephant was recorded to have reached 82 years old. His name was \u2018Raja\u2019 and he lived in captivity in Sri Lanka.The closest relatives to the elephant are the Hyraxes and Sea Cows (dugongs and manatees). Elephants are also related to Horses, Tapirs and Rhinos.",
            "elephant diet": "An elephant spends around 16 hours a day eating, drinking, bathing, dusting, wallowing, playing and 3 \u2013 5 hours resting. As an elephant only digests some 40 percent of what it eats, it needs a tremendous amount of vegetation (approximately 5 percent of its body weight per day) and about 30 to 50 gallons of water. A young elephant must learn how to draw water up into its trunk and then pour it into its mouth. Elephants eat an extremely varied vegetarian diet, including grass, leaves, twigs, bark, fruit and seed pods. Favoured foods include: Bananas, bamboo, berries, mangoes, coconuts, corn, jungle shrubs, palm fruits, sugar cane, wood apples and wild rice.Elephants eat grass, small branches and bark from trees. Elephants especially like leaves from the top branches. They get the leaves by pushing down the trees with their large heads and bodies, then they get the bark by scraping it with their sharp tusks.Salt is essential and an elephant shows a distinct liking for it. Cold climates can cause an elephant to have stomach aches. Some elephants will even peel fruit before eating. The holy Thai white elephant is very particular about eating and will not consume any food that has fallen on the ground and will not eat with the rest of the herd. The fibrous content of their food and the great quantities consumed makes for large volumes of dung.",
            "elephant conservation": "Under the Endangered Species Act, the African elephant is listed as a threatened species and the Asian elephant is listed as an endangered species. \u2018Endangered\u2019 means a species is considered in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, and \u2018threatened\u2019 means a species is considered in danger of becoming endangered."

It is one of the largest deer species in the world, along with the Moose and the Sambar Deer. Elks are native to North America and East Asia although they have adapted well to countries where they have been introduced. In parts of Asia, antlers and their velvet are used in traditional medicines. Elks are hunted as a game species as their meat is leaner and higher in protein than beef or chicken. In North America, male elks are referred to as \u2018bulls\u2019 and females as \u2018cows\u2019, however, in Asia, males are called \u2018stags\u2019 and females are called \u2018hinds\u2019. Worldwide population of elk, counting those on farms and in the wild, is approximately 2 million.",
            "description": "Elks are ruminant animals that have a four chambered stomach, the first chamber stores food and the other three chambers digest it. Their hair has a reddish hue during the summer which turns to a more lighter/grey color during the winter.Colouration can vary depending on season and habitat. Elks have clearly defined buff colored patches on their rumps. Calves are born spotted which is common with many deer species and they lose their spots by the end of summer.Towards winter, elks grow a thicker coat of hair consisting of long, waterproof guard hairs covering dense, woolly under fur to insulate them from the cold. Some elks grow thin neck manes.When summer is approaching, elks rub against trees to remove the excess hair from their bodies. Elks wade or lie in streams, rivers, ponds and lakes to seek relief from heat and biting insects.Males elks have very large antlers which begin to grow in the spring and are shed every winter. Antlers can reach a length of 4 feet (1.2 metres) and weigh as much as 18 kilograms (40 pounds).Antlers are made of bone and can grow at a rate of 1 inch per day. While actively growing, the antlers are covered with and protected by a soft layer of highly vascularised skin known as \u2018velvet\u2019.Blood pumping through the veins in the velvet on a bulls antlers cools before it returns to the heart to help keep the animal cool. The velvet is shed in the summer when the antlers have fully developed. Female elks do not have antlers. All elks have short tails.Mature male elks are around 25% larger than female elks. Male elks stand around 5 feet (1.5 metres) tall at the shoulder, measure 8 feet (2.5 metres) in length and weigh 320 kilograms (700 pounds). Female elks stand 4 \u2013 4.5 feet (1.3 metres) at the shoulder, measure 6.5 feet (2 metres) from nose to tail and weigh an average of 225 kilograms (500 pounds).",
            "habitat": "Throughout their range, elks live in forest, forest edge and alpine meadows. In mountainous regions, they often dwell at higher elevations in summer, migrating down slope for winter. The highly adaptable elk also inhabit semi-deserts in North America.",
            "diet": "Elks were herbivorous, eating grass and browsing vegetation from the edges of woodlands. They also feed up on plants, leaves and bark. During the summer, elks eat almost constantly, consuming between 4 and 7 kilograms (10 to 15 pounds) daily.Elks may supplement their diet at salt licks, where they take in minerals that may help them grow healthy coats and produce nutritious milk.",
            "behaviour": "Mature elks remain in male or female herds for most of the year. Elk cows have a strong herding instinct. During spring and summer, herds of cows and their calves usually graze separately from the bulls. An older cow usually leads the summer herd. As young bulls get older, they spend less time with the cow herds. During winter, males and females forage together.As with many deer species, elks migrate. Elks that live in mountainous regions migrate to areas of higher altitude in springtime, following retreating snows and then to lower altitudes in the autumn.During the winter, they prefer wooded areas and sheltered valleys for protection from the wind and availability of tree bark to eat. Some species of elk such as the Roosevelt elk do not migrate due to less seasonal variability of food sources.Bull elks can move silently through forests at speeds up to 35 miles per hour. Both bulls and cows are strong swimmers. Their walking stride is 30 to 60 inches, however, when running this length can increase to 14 feet.Agitated elks hold their heads high, lay their ears back and flare their nostrils and sometimes even punch with their front hooves.Natural predators of elks include wolves and cougars. Bears and coyotes kill some calves and sick adults.",
            "reproduction": "Male elks engage in ritualised mating behaviours during the rut (the mating period), including posturing, antler wrestling and bugling, a loud series of screams which establishes dominance over other males and attracts females.The bugle call is one of the most distinctive calls in nature. Bugling is often associated with an adaptation to open environments such as parklands, meadows, and savannas, where sound can travel great distances.The rut lasts from August until early winter. During this time a bull may have up to 20 cows in his harem which he defends fiercely. A bull with a harem rarely feeds and he may lose up to 20 percent of his body weight.Female elks have a short estrous cycle of only 1 or 2 days. The gestation period lasts between 240 to 262 days after which one or rarely, 2 babies are born. Unlike other types of baby deer, an Elk baby is called a calf. When close to giving birth, the female elk will isolate herself from the rest of the herd and will remain isolated until the calf is large enough to escape predators.Calves weigh around 15 \u2013 16 kilograms (33 \u2013 35 pounds) at birth. A calf can stand by the time it is 20 minutes old. After around 2 weeks, calves are able to join the herd and after 2 months, they are fully weaned. Calves remain with their mothers until the next breeding period begins. Elks live 20 years or more in captivity, however, only 8 to 13 years in the wild.",
            "conservation status": "Elks are susceptible to a number of infectious diseases, some of which can be transmitted to livestock. Efforts to eliminate infectious diseases from elk populations, largely through vaccination, have had mixed success.Elks were once found across much of North America, however, they were killed off and driven to take refuge in more remote locations.Today they live primarily in western North America, especially in mountainous landscapes such as Wyoming\u2019s National Elk Refuge and Yellowstone National Park. Some eastern U.S. states have reintroduced small elk herds into heavily wooded wilderness areas.",

Emperor Penguins have short wings that help them to dive up to 900 feet to catch larger fish.Emperor Penguins can swim 10 \u2013 15 kilometres an hour which lets them escape their main enemy, the leopard seal.Emperor Penguins can stay warm because they have a thick layer of down under the outer feathers and a layer of blubber. The layer of downy feathers trap air that keeps the body heat in and cold air and water out. Emperor Penguins also have large amounts of body oil that aids in keeping them dry in the water.",
            "diet": "Unlike most penguins, which feed on surface krill, emperor penguins live on fish, squid and crustaceans caught on long, deep pursuit dives. They will quite often reach depths of more than 700 feet and remain submerged for up to 18 minutes.",

In May, female Emperors will lay a single egg after a 63 day gestation period, and then will pass the egg over to her mate while she goes off to sea to feed.Male Emperor Penguins will be unable to eat during the ensuing 9 week incubation period. Instead, he must keep his egg warm by balancing it on his feet, where it is insulated by a thick roll of skin and feathers called the \u2018brood pouch\u2019. For added warmth and protection against the bitter winds and sub-zero temperatures, the male Emperor Penguins huddle together in tight bunches. After the eggs have hatched, young chicks will remain in the \u2018brood pouch\u2019 for a short time until they are able to regulate their own body temperatures.By the time the female returns to take over feeding the chick, the male will have lost up to a third of his body weight. He must now make another long trek over the ice, up to 60 miles to find food. By January, as the sea-ice begins to break out, the chicks have lost most of their soft silvery-grey down and are now able to head out independently for the open sea.",

Emus have soft, long, brown feathers on their plumage which has a shaggy appearance and shorter downy feathers on their heads.The shafts and tips of their feathers are black and the energy from the sun is absorbed through the tips and the loose-packed inner plumage insulates their skin from the heat allowing the emu to be active during the heat of the day. When temperatures are very hot, the emu pants to help maintain its body temperature.Emus have large multi folded nasal passages for normal breathing in cooler weather. Emus have strong long legs and although they cannot fly, they can run at speeds of 50 kilometres per hour (31 miles per hour).Emus have a soft pointed beak adapted for grazing and large eyes which are golden brown to black.

            "behaviour": "Emus are quite vocal birds and their vocalizations include a loud booming noise which is created by an inflatable neck sac that has a thin wall and is around 12 inches (30 centimetres) long. They also make grunting sounds and a deep-throated drumming sound. Some of their noises can be heard up to 2 kilometres away. Emus are generally nomadic.They usually travel in pairs although they can form huge flocks. They follow a seasonal migration pattern, typically north in the summer and south in the winter although eastern emus seem to follow no pattern at all.Emus are able to swim when the need arises. They are human fearless birds and have been known to approach small groups of humans and help themselves to any food on offer.\u00a0",
            "reproduction": "Breeding pairs form in the summer months of December and January and mating occurs in the cooler months of May and June. An Emus breeding behaviour incorporates male incubation, this is because the male experiences hormone changes.Male emus are dedicated parents. As the egg laying period approaches, males will lose their appetite and begin to construct a nest using sticks, grass, leaves and bark.The female emu lays her eggs (on average 11 eggs) which are large, thick-shelled and green in color and then leaves the male emu to do the brooding. The female emu will mate with other males and will produce multiple clutches of eggs.For the next 8 weeks after the eggs have been laid, the male will sit on the nest, carefully turning the eggs around 10 times each day. An average egg can measure 5 inches long and 3 inches wide and weigh up to 900 grams.During this brooding time, the male emu may lose one third of his body weight by not feeding while brooding the clutch of eggs. He survives only on stored body fat.Once the eggs hatch, the male emu will stay with the chicks for the next 18 months, teaching them to hunt for food. Chicks are active very soon after hatching. They stand around 5 inches (12 centimetres) tall and weigh 0.5 kilograms (18 ounces).Emu chicks have distinctive cream and brown diagonal stripes to help them camouflage which will fade after around 3 months. Chicks are fully grown when they are 12 \u2013 14 months old. The life span of an emu is between 10 and 12 years in the wild.",
            "conservation status": "Emus are farmed for their oil, leather and meat, however, emus are common birds with an estimated population of around 725,000. Emu populations vary from decade to decade depending on rainfall. Some isolated populations in New South Wales are listed as Endangered due to collisions with vehicles, loss of habitat and the increase of feral dogs and pigs.\u00a0"

            "desc": "The erect-crested penguin (Eudyptes sclateri) is one of the species of crested penguin, and is endemic to New Zealand. With a striking look, it has plumes of yellow feathers extending from the bill to the back of the head, as well as black upper parts and white underparts. Little is actually known about the erect-crested penguin and their breeding habits, but it is thought that the numbers of these animals are declining and it is considered endangered. Let\u2019s take a look at this crested penguin in further detail below. Crested penguin is the collective term given to species of penguins of the genus Eudyptes, of which the erect-crested penguin is one. It is also one of three similar-looking crested penguins endemic to southern New Zealand, often being confused with Fiordland penguins (E. pachyrhynchus) and Snares penguins (E. robustus).",
            "location": "While some members of the erect-crested penguin species are found along the coasts of Australia, New Zealand, and nearby islands in the Southern Ocean (such as the Auckland Islands, Campbell Island, and Macquarie Island), breeding populations are limited to the Bounty and Antipodes Islands near New Zealand.These penguins nest in large colonies on rocky terrain.",
            "lifespan": "Erect-crested penguins may live as long as 18 years.",
            "diet": "While erect-crested penguins are not well studied, it is thought that they feed on small fish, krill and squid like other crested penguin species.",
            "behavior": "Erect-crested penguins are colonial breeders, and typically forage in small flocks when close to their breeding islands. They only come to land to breed and moult. Fighting over nests is a frequent occurrence at their colonies as prime nesting sites are often hard to come by and competition can be fierce.",
            "breeding": "Erect-crested penguins travel between May and August, covering a wide area of land looking for food. In early September, at the start of the breeding season, the males and females return to rocky shores to breed, laying eggs in early to mid October. Their nests are usual simple, made of just a few stones and a little mud and sometimes lined with grass.The female lays two eggs, with the second egg being 17-138% larger than the first egg and typically the only egg incubated full term. Both the male and the female share incubation and care of the young chicks, and they hatch in November.For the first two or three weeks of life, the chick is cared for by its father. The chick then remains with its mother. When its parents are away gathering food, the chick joins a cr\u00e8che with other members of its cohort for protection.By February, the chick is old enough to live on its own and depart the island at this time. Young become sexually mature at four years old.Conservation StatusIt is thought that about 42,500 breeding pairs of erect-crested penguins breed on the Antipodes Islands, and 26,000 pairs on the Bounty Islands. There is an estimated world population of about 68,500 pairs. However, it has been noted that the population of erect-crested penguins is declining and has been since the 1970s.Since 2000, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the species as endangered, and it is also listed as endangered and granted protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.However, it is still not clear why the penguin population is declining. Researchers have been able to rule out mortality due to hunting or introduced predators, but it may be down to oceanographic productivity, which requires adults to swim further to find food for their chicks and therefore reduces breeding success.\u00a0",
            "erect-crested penguin \u2013 summary of facts": "The Erect-crested Penguin is a penguin from New Zealand.Erect-crested penguins breed on the Bounty and Antipodes Islands.The total population is about 200,000 breeding pairs.This is a medium-sized, yellow-crested, black-and-white penguin, growing to approximately 60 centimetres in height.Erect-crested penguins have a bluish-black to jet black upper parts and white under parts and a broad, bright yellow eyebrow-stripe which extends over the eye to form a short, erect crest.Erect-crested penguins are able to raise and lower their stiff crest feathers, which none of the other crested penguins can do.These penguins are sometimes called the \u2018Sclater\u2019s Penguins\u2018.These penguins are preyed upon by skuas and Fur seals.The current status of the Erect-crested penguins is endangered due to population decline and a small breeding range restricted to two locations.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "characteristics": "Ethiopian Wolves are different than other wolves in that they have a longer muzzle and smaller teeth. The male ethiopian wolves are significantly larger than the females, with the males weighing from 33 \u2013 42 pounds (15 \u2013 19 kilograms) and females weighing from 24 \u2013 31 pounds (11.2 \u2013 14.15 kilograms). Their legs are comparatively long. Their body color is an overall reddish brown with white undersides, legs and markings on the face. Ethiopian Wolves bushy tails are white at the base and black at the tip.",

            "reproduction": "Female Ethiopian Wolves carry their pups for approximately 60 \u2013 62 days. The female gives birth to her litter in a den that she digs out in the ground under a boulder or in a rocky crevice. When the pups are born they are charcoal grey, they have no teeth and their eyes are closed. When the pups are about 3 weeks old, their coat begins to be replaced by normal adult coloring and the young start to emerge from the den. The life span of the Ethiopian Wolf is actually unknown.",
            "diet": "The Ethiopian Wolf is a carnivore. The Ethiopian Wolf preys on rodents ranging in size from hares to the Giant Mole Rat to that of the common grass rats. They also eat eggs, goslings and young ungulates and they will occasionally scavenge on carcasses. Ethiopian Wolves also catch their prey in shallow holes.",
            "behaviour": "When feeding on rodents, ethiopian wolves tend to hunt alone, however, they are territorial social canids that form packs and defend territories. The pack, which contains up to 12 adults with a skewed mating ratio of several males to each female, patrols and defends the territory. For more information on the behaviour of wolves in general see Wolf Behaviour.",
            "": "Continuous loss of habitat due to high-altitude subsistence agriculture represents the major current threat to the Ethiopian wolf. Sixty percent of all land above 3,200 metres (10,000 feet) has been converted into farmland and all Ethiopian wolf populations below 3,700 metres (12,000 feet) are particularly vulnerable to further habitat loss. Habitat loss is exacerbated by overgrazing of highland pastures by domestic livestock and in some areas habitat is threatened by proposed development of commercial sheep farms and roads.",
            "conservation status": "The Ethiopian Wolf is classed as \u2018Endangered\u2019. In 1997 the IUCN Canid Specialist Group published an Action Plan for the Conservation of the Ethiopian Wolf, aiming to move forward with the conservation of the species across the country.Recommendations in the Ethiopian Wolf Action Plan included that further surveys be conducted in Northern Ethiopia, in order to assess the global status of the species. In 1998 and 1999, the Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Program (EWCP), a WildCRU undertaking supported by the Born Free Foundation (a UK based NGO), conducted preliminary surveys in all suitable afroalpine habitats in the Amhara Region, northwest of the Rift Valley, leading to an increase of the estimated global population of Ethiopian wolf from around 400 individuals to between 500 and 550 individuals.The most important results were from the Wollo Administrative Zone, where wolf presence was not widely known and was confirmed in a number of habitat areas during the EWCP surveys, leading to an estimate of around 80 wolves in the area."

            "image": "https://animalcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/The-Eagle-Owl-340x200.png",
            "desc": "The Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo), sometimes abbreviated to just the \u201ceagle-owl\u201d in Europe, is a species of eagle owl that resides in much of Eurasia. It is one of the largest species of owl, and females can grow to a total length of 75 cm (30 in), with a wingspan of 188 cm (6 ft 2 in). Males are usually smaller. These birds are recognized by their ear tufts and mottled upper parts. The Eurasian eagle-owl belongs to the genus Bubo and the order Strigiformes. It belongs to the family Strigidae. At least 12 subspecies of the Eurasian eagle-owls are recognized. Eurasian eagle owls are found in many habitats, but are mostly found in mountainous regions and rocky regions, especially in areas that are relatively remote. They reside near varied woodland edge and shrubby areas with openings or wetlands to hunt the majority of their prey, but can also be found near farmland or park-like settings in cities occasionally.",
            "moulting": "The first moult of an eagle-owl starts the year after hatching with some body feathers and wing coverts being replaced. The next year, the three central secondaries on each wing and three middle tail feathers are shed and regrown, and the following year, two or three primaries and their coverts are lost.In the final year of the post-juvenile moult, the remaining primaries are moulted and all the juvenile feathers will have been replaced. Another moult takes place during years 6-12 of the bird\u2019s life, which takes place each year between July and December.\u00a0",
            "lifespan": "In the wild, the eagle owl can live for around 20 years, but captive birds can live up to 60 years. Because of their size and nocturnal habits, adult eagle-owls have very few natural predators and early death is usually caused by electrocution, traffic accidents and shooting.\u00a0",
            "eurasian eagle-owl diet": "Eurasian eagle-owls are carnivores and mainly feed on small to medium-sized mammals weighing between 0.4 and 4.4 lbs (200 and 2,000 g). They favor animals such as rabbits, hares, voles, rats and mice, but they will also take prey up to the size of foxes and even young deer up to 37 lbs (17 kg) . They also hunt other birds (including smaller owls), up to the size of herons and other birds of prey, such as buzzards. They may also eat amphibians, reptiles (including snakes), fish and insects.Hunting usually takes place at dusk and dawn and mainly consists of the owl watching from a perch for prey activity and then swooping down swiftly once prey is spotted. Their prey usually has no idea they were being stalked. Occasionally, they may capture other birds on the wing, and they may even plunge into water to catch fish.The prey is often killed quickly by the eagle owl\u2019s powerful grip and talons though is sometimes bitten on the head to be killed as well. Then the prey item is swallowed whole or torn into pieces with the bill. Most prey, even up to the size of small rabbits, are swallowed whole.Most hunting occurs in wood-cloaked openings, often those carved out by wetlands or watersheds. While they can hunt within woodlands, the eagle owl finds this more difficult as they rely more on their sight rather than hearing for hunting. They often use tree branches, rock formations, rubble with large rocks, hills with tall grasses or even a building as a hunting perch.\u00a0",
            "eurasian eagle-owl behavior": "Eagle owls are primarily solitary animals except during the mating period. Despite their large size, these animals are elusive and have been hard to study in their natural habitats. They are nocturnal, becoming active and dusk and remaining active throughout the night. During the day, they roost in high up trees, but if food is scarce they will hunt during this time.They\u2019ll fiercely defend their territory against other owls and will only overlap territories slightly if food is sparse. They prefer to stay within the same territory unless they are forced to leave due to food shortages or if they are driven out by other owls.They are a non migratory bird, and even those that live in the coldest climates that may suffer food shortages in the winter will not leave their native range.The Eurasian eagle owl is a broad-winged species and engages in a strong, direct flight, usually consisting of shallow wing beats and long, surprisingly fast glides.\u00a0",
            "communication": "The Eurasian eagle-owl uses loud calls to communicate, and are often heard more than they are seen. They use a variety of hoots and clucks, with different noises having different meanings.The different members of a group can be identified by their different vocalizations, too.During the breeding season, the females sometimes make a coarse \u201ckraaah\u201d sound. The young also make this sound. Eagle-owls are also able to decipher the size and distance of intruders based on the intensity of their call.In January and February, the primary function for vocalization becomes for the purpose of courtship. While these birds are territorial all year round, territorial calling appears to peak around October to early January.When calling for the purposes of courtship, males tend to bow and hoot loudly. Courtship in the Eurasian eagle-owl may involve bouts of \u201cduetting\u201d, with the male sitting upright and the female bowing as she calls.\u00a0",
            "reproduction": "Eurasian eagle-owls typically breed from the end of February to the end of April. They are considered to be monogamous, but some cases of bigamy have been recorded.The male selects breeding sites and advertises their potential to the female by flying to them and kneading out a small depression (if soil is present) and making staccato notes and clucking noises.Several potential sites may be presented, with the female selecting one. They usually nest on cliff ledges, in cracks and crevices between rocks and in caves and may re-use the same nest site over several years.Usually egg laying begins in late winter. An average clutch consists of 1 to 5 , possibly 6 white eggs; the number of eggs largely depends on the amount of food that is available at the time. The eggs measure 2.2 to 2.9\u2033 x 1.7 to 2.1\u2033 (56 to 73mm x 44.2 to 53mm) and weigh from 2.6 to 2.8 oz (75 to 80 g). The eggs are normally laid at 3 day intervals.The female alone incubates these eggs alone for 31 to 36 days, while the male feeds the female. Once the eggs are hatched, the male eagle-owl continues to hunt until the young are 4 to 5 weeks old and the female spends all her time brooding at the nest.The nestlings leave the nest when they are about 5 weeks old and take their first flight 2 to 3 weeks later. They remain dependent on the parents for another 3 to 4 months. Juveniles have rudimentary ear-tufts, a narrowly barred under plumage and a buffy down on the head.At about seven to eight weeks, the owlets are ready to fly, but still require food from the parents for several weeks after that. The Eurasian eagle-owl reaches sexual maturity when they are about 1 year old, but usually don\u2019t breed until they are 2 to 3 years old. Eagle-owls are able to breed from the ages of 2 to 31 years.",
            "": "Eurasian Eagle-Owl Location and HabitatThe Eurasian eagle-owl is one of the most widely distributed of all owl species, although it is far less wide-ranging than the barn owl. The vast majority of eagle-owls live in Continental Europe, including Spain, Portugal, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Austria and Greece. It is also found in Scandinavia, Russia (which is almost certainly where the peak numbers and diversity of race occurs), and Central Asia.Additional minor populations exist in Anatolia, the northern Middle East, the montane upper part of South Asia and in China; in addition, an estimated 12 to 40 pairs are thought to reside in the United Kingdom as of 2016 (where they are arguably non-native), a number which may be on the rise.These adaptable owls inhabit areas with many rocks, cliffs, ravines and open spaces with scattered trees, coniferous forests, deserts and semi-deserts; as well as taiga, wooded steppe and farmland with suitable rocky areas. In fact, they have been found living in almost every climatic and environmental condition on the Eurasian continent, excluding the greatest extremities.They are often found in the largest numbers in areas where cliffs and ravines are surrounded by a scattering of trees and bushes, as well as wetland areas as these often house small prey, such as voles and rabbits.In recent history, they have also moved into urban habitats, breeding in quarries and buildings. Although found in the largest numbers in areas sparsely populated by humans, they have been seen in farmland areas, as well as park-like settings in Europe. They can be found at elevations of up to about 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) in Europe and 14,700 feet (4,500 meters) in Central Asia and the Himalayas. However, they can also be found at sea level.Territories are established by the male eagle owl, who selected the highest points in the territory from which to sing. Territory size is similar or occasionally slightly greater than great horned owl: averaging 15 to 80 km2 (5.8 to 30.9 sq mi).Eurasian Eagle-Owl Conservation StatusEurasian eagle-owls has a very large range (about 32,000,000 km2 (12,000,000 sq mi) across much of Europe and Asia) and their population is believed to be between 19,000 to 38,000 breeding pairs, and in the whole world around 250,000 to 2,500,000 individual birds.Despite the fact that the eagle-owl population is thought to be decreasing because of human activities, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the bird as being of \u201cleast concern\u201d.Eagle owls are economically beneficial to farmers that want to keep the number of rodents down on their land, and removal of them from the ecosystem would mean we would be overrun with rats and other pests!",
            "predators": "One the Eurasian eagle-owl reaches adulthood, they are at the top of the food chain in their niche and are at a very low risk of predation. Healthy adults normally have no natural predators, thus are considered apex predators. The leading cause of death for the eagle-owl is electrocution, traffic accidents and shooting.They are most at risk during their early years, where they are at risk from any predator too large for them to eat. Fortunately, the mother stays with the young for most of this period and keeps the predators at bay. Due to their striped, spotted, and varied coloring, they are extremely well camouflaged, especially when perching in the trees.\u00a0\u00a0"

Eurasian wolves will occasionally eat smaller prey such as frogs and hares. In Europe, their largest prey is the wisent, while in Asia, it is the yak.Because of increasing shortage of natural prey, wolves are sometimes forced to give up their pack-hunting habits and scavenge for food around villages and farmhouses. Many rural villages have open dumps where the local slaughterhouse disposes of its waste. Many wolves feed there alongside feral or stray dogs.",
            "conservation status": "In Norway, in 2001, the Norwegian Government authorised a controversial wolf cull on the grounds that the animals were overpopulating and were responsible for the killing of more than 600 sheep in 2000. The Norwegian authorities, whose original plans to kill 20 wolves were scaled down amid public outcry. In 2005, the Norwegian government proposed another cull, with the intent of exterminating 25% of Norways wolf population. A recent study of the wider Scandinavian wolf population concluded there were 120 individuals at the most, causing great concern on the genetic health of the population.Wolves cross over the border from Russia into Finland on a regular basis. Although they are protected under EU law, Finland has issued hunting permits on a preventative basis in the past, which resulted in the European Commission taking legal action in 2005. In June 2007 the European Court of Justice ruled that Finland had breached the Habitats Directive but that both sides had failed in at least one of their claims. Finland\u2019s wolf population is estimated at around 250. Eurasian wolves are currently considered as \u2018Least Concern\u2019 by the IUCN."

False Black Widow Spiders are also common around dwellings and gardens as well as under rocks and wood. Originally a native of southern Europe as far east as Georgia. Adults occur from June to November.False Black Widow Spiders construct a cobweb of an irregular tangle of sticky silken fibres. As with other web-weaving spiders, False Black Widow Spiders have very poor eyesight.False Black Widow Spiders depend mostly on vibrations reaching them through their webs to orient themselves to prey or warn them of danger such as larger animals that could injure or kill them.False Black Widow Spiders are not aggressive spiders and most injuries to humans are due to defensive bites delivered when a spider gets accidentally disturbed. It is possible that some bites may result when a spider mistakes a finger thrust into its web for its normal prey, however, ordinarily intrusion by any large creature will cause these spiders to flee.False Black Widow Spiders are now increasing in numbers in the United Kingdom due to global warming.",

Each sac can contain 200 or more cream-colored eggs. Although the males can live for up to 18 months, they die shortly after mating. All stages of the immature spiders can be found in human-made structures throughout the year, as can the adults.",
            "venom": "The bite itself from the False Black Widow Spider is not usually felt, however, within a short space of time, a local burning sensation is followed by radiating pain. Within 20 minutes, the affected part will swell and develop a weal.If bitten on the hand, within 3 \u2013 4 hours, swelling will develop and tingling will be felt. Two small puncture wounds in the region of the swelling, surrounded by local abnormal redness of the skin with a small bluish tinge will occur a few hours later.However bites by the False Black Widow Spider generally do not have any long-lasting effects. The symptoms associated with the bite of several False Black Widow Spider species are known in the medical profession as \u2018steatodism\u2019 and have been described as a less severe form of latrodectism (the symptoms associated with a widow spider bite). The Redback Spider antivenin has been shown to be effective at treating bites from False Black Widow Spiders, after it was mistakenly administered to a bite victim who was incorrectly believed to have been bitten by the far more dangerous Redback Spider.Frequency of bites from False Black Widow Spiders have increased as the species spreads into the south and east of England."

They are most notable for their very large ears, which are used to both aid their hearing and to help them to control their body temperature. Belonging to the family Canidae, these small animals are close relatives of dogs, but have adapted to life in the desert. The exact population of the fennec fox is not known, but they are frequently seen in the wild and it is thought they are not threatened by extinction. Thanks to their cute appearance, they are kept as pets in some parts of the world, and their fur is prized by the indigenous peoples of North Africa. ",
            "lifespan": "The fennec fox has a life span of up to 14 years in captivity and about 10 years in the wild.",
            "diet": "The fennec fox is an omnivore and eats a variety of different foods, including insects, rodents, snails, lizards, geckos plants, fruits, roots, and eggs. They eat foods both above the sand and below the surface, using their ears and excellent hearing to hunt down their prey.They have adapted to the desert environment and are able to live with very little water. Most of the water they need comes from the plants they consume. Their kidneys are specially developed to ensure that there is minimal water loss in their day to day lives.",
            "behavior": "Fennec foxes are mostly nocturnal animals, which helps them to escape the heat and predators. They emerge from their dens at dusk to begin to search for food. Their large ears allow them to successfully hunt and locate food sources, even prey that is under the ground.They are usually solitary animals, but can live in groups of up to 10 individuals. A group of foxes is called a \u201cskulk\u201d or a \u201cleash\u201d. Their dens can be in close proximity to each other, or in some cases connected to one another. Like other canines, male fennec foxes mark their territory with urine and become incredibly aggressive towards one another, particularly when competing for females during the mating season.Fennec foxes can be vocal and use barking, whimpering and whining to communicate with each other.",
            "reproduction": "Fennec foxes mate between January and March and are monogamous, meaning that once they have found a mate, they mate for life! Couples will inhabit the same den for the entire year. After mating, the male becomes very aggressive and protects the female, providing her with food during pregnancy and lactation.The gestation period of a fennec fox is two months long and the vixen will produce between 2 and 5 offspring that are known as kits. The kits usually weigh just 50 grams at birth and are gray in color. They open their eyes after 8 to 11 days and nurse for the first 5 weeks of life before moving onto solid food.Fennec foxes remain with their mother for the first two months of their life, during which time the male fox hunts for food for the family. Fennec foxes are fully mature by the time they are 11 months old.Habitat and LocationFennec foxes can be found in regions across northern Africa and the northern Sinai peninsula. Their range covers Morocco across to Egypt, south to north Niger and Sudan and east to Kuwait, and they live in both the Sahara and Nubian deserts. They thrive in sandy and semi-arid desert regions and survive by digging extensive underground burrows within sand dunes that can be up to 120 m2 (1,300 square feet) large, with up to 15 different entrances. These burrows help to keep them cool and also protect them from predators.Conservation StatusThe fennec fox is not currently endangered and is currently listed as a species of least concern, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Fennec foxes are at risk from the illegal pet trade, particularly in North Africa where they are captured and sold to tourists. They are bred commercially as an exotic pet, with breeders removing pups from their mother to hand-raise them. They are also hunted for their fur.",
            "predators": "Fennec foxes do not have many common predators in their natural environment. The biggest predator of fennec foxes in the wild is the eagle owl, but they are also preyed on by larger mammals such as hyenas, caracals, jackals and domestic dogs. They are also threatened by habitat loss due to humans."

            "desc": "The ferret (Mustela furo) is a domesticated species, found all over the world. They belong to the family Mustelidae, which also includes the stoat, badger and mink. It is thought that they are most likely a domesticated form of the wild European ferret or polecat (Mustela putorius). Ferrets are usually characterized by their long, slender bodies and long tails. They are sexually dimorphic and males are considerably larger than females. They are carnivores and, in captivity, usually eat dry foods such as cat food, but may also be fed pre-killed or live prey by their owners. Ferrets make good pets and are popular throughout the world, with over 5 million in the United States alone. However, in some countries, such as New Zealand, there are restrictions on ferret owning. It is unclear when or how the ferret became domesticated, but it is thought they were most likely bred for sports such as hunting.",
            "average lifespan": "As pets, ferrets can live for between 6 and 10 years. However, in the wild, they do not live as long. That being said, there are some diseases and illnesses that can drastically shorten the lifespan on the domestic ferret, including rabies, urinary stones and bone marrow suppression.\u00a0",
            "diet": "Ferrets are obligate carnivores, meaning they must eat only meat and cannot survive without it. Domesticated ferrets should eat a diet of at least 20% fat and 34% animal protein, and therefore are usually fed some form of ferret food, cat food, or dog food. They can also be fed raw meat but this on its own is not enough. In the wild, ferrets eat all parts of their prey, including the liver, heart, and other organs. Their prey includes mice, rats, gophers, prairie dogs, rabbits, and other small mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians.The ferret has a very high metabolism and therefore food travels through the digestive tract in 3-5 hours. Because of this, ferrets need to eat up to 10 times a day",
            "behavior": "It is unclear how the ferret first became domesticated, but it is thought that it probably involved hunting. They may have been domesticated for around 2,500 years ago, and the Egyptians may have been the first to domesticate them.Ferrets were historically used for hunting thanks to their long, lean build, and inquisitive nature, which made them well equipped for getting down holes and chasing rodents, rabbits and moles out of their burrows. They were first introduced into the American continents in the 17th century, and were used extensively from 1860 until the start of World War II to protect grain stores in the American West from rodents. They are still used for hunting in some countries, including the United Kingdom.The ferret is naturally crepuscular and is most active at dawn and dusk, but domestic ferrets will change this depending on when their owner is around to give them attention. They are playful and will interact with other pet ferrets, cats, and dogs in a friendly manner. Despite this, they also often sleep 18 to 20 hours per day. They actually sleep so deeply that one can hold, poke and yell at them and they won\u2019t wake up!Ferrets seek out attention and can be trained. They can be taught tricks and will respond to discipline, and have an instinct to habitually urinate and defecate in the same places, and therefore can be trained to use a litter box.The ferret will \u201cdance\u201d when it is happy or excited, and will engage in playful wrestling with other ferrets. They also have many forms of verbal communication, including \u2018docking\u2019 or \u2018clucking\u2019 to show they are excited. They will \u2018bark\u2019 if they are very excited. They will also \u2018screech\u2019 as a sign of terror, pain, or anger.Ferrets have anal glands that produce musk, used for individual recognition and marking territory. They mark territory by dragging their scent glands across the ground or spraying with urine. The musk is an unpleasant odor, so animals sold in the US are already descented, whereas descenting is considered unnecessary mutilation in other parts of the world.\u00a0",
            "reproduction": "Male domestic ferrets go into rut between December and July. Female ferrets go into heat between March and August. Male ferrets will mate with as many females as they have access to. An intact female is a jill, and a spayed female is a sprite. An intact male is a hob, and a neutered male is a gib.Healthy domestic ferrets can have up to three successful litters per year, and up to 15 kits. The average gestation period is 42 days. Kits are born deaf and have their eyes closed and typically weigh about 6 to 12 grams. Baby incisors appear about 10 days after birth. When they are 5 weeks old, the kits eyes and ears open. They are weaned after three to six weeks and become independent at three months. They become sexually mature at approximately 6 months.\u00a0Ferret Location and HabitatFerrets are found all over the world as domesticated pets. In the wild, they live throughout Europe, northern and western Asia, and North Africa. The black-footed ferret species, which is often confused with the domestic ferret, lives in the shrublands and grasslands of North America and hence is also called the North American black-footed ferret.In the wild, ferrets reside in forests, meadows, parks, villages, farms, and barns or anywhere there is food. They also prefer areas where there are water sources close by.Ferret Conservation StatusFerrets are not considered to be endangered or threatened and they are not listed on any conservation lists. The biggest threat to domesticated ferrets is health problems, of which the most common for ferrets are cancers affecting the adrenal glands, pancreas, and lymphatic system.In the United States, ferrets were relatively rare pets until the 1980s. They are illegal in California under Fish and Game Code Section 2118, and are also illegal as pets in Queensland and the Northern Territory in Australia. In New Zealand, it has been illegal to sell, distribute or breed ferrets since 2002, unless certain conditions are met. In Brazil, ferrets are allowed only if they are given a microchip identification tag and sterilized.",

They particularly like overgrown fields with damp tussocky grass. Field voles are also found on moors and in hedgerows. They are usually absent from cropped arable land.",
            "diet": "Field voles food is primarily succulent grass stems and green leaves, however, roots, bulbs and bark are also eaten, particularly in winter when fresh vegetation is hard to find.",
            "behaviour": "Field voles are active by day and night. They can be aggressive and each one has its own small territory which it fiercely defends from other voles. They fight noisily, uttering loud squeaks and angry chattering noises. Each vole makes runways among the grass stems, usually centred on a tussock where it nests.Although Field voles dig burrows, they usually build nests above ground at the base of grass stems, sometimes protected by a stone or log. They make small underground cavities in which grass is stored for the winter.Field voles are one of the most numerous British mammals and because they are heavy breeders, populations in a favourable habitat often increase their populations to thousands and is known as a \u2018vole plague\u2019. When this happens, competition for space and food and increased aggression leads to less successful breeding, with the result of a population decline.The fluctuations in populations usually occur in 3 \u2013 5 year cycles, as aforementioned. Some predator populations also increase as the vole populations increase. Field voles are the main food of barn owls, forming 90 per cent of their diet. A shortage of voles has an effect on the number of young barn owls reared.Other predators include foxes, stoats, weasels, kestrels and snakes.",
            "reproduction": "Field voles breed during March to October, however, they may continue breeding into December. Females produce 4 \u2013 6 young after a gestation period of 18 \u2013 20 days. Young voles are born in a nest of dry grass, usually hidden in a thick grassy tussock.Males can breed at 40 days of age, females at 28 days. They are therefore able to produce 2 \u2013 7 litters of 4 \u2013 6 young per year. The young have grown their fur by 10 days old and are weaned at around 16 days. The lifespan of a field vole is around 2 years.",

The eggs are incubated for 30 to 36 days with the parents taking turns on the nest (in long 5 to 12 day shifts) while the other goes out to sea to feed.As is the case with many penguin species, the first egg usually fails to hatch and even if both chicks do hatch, the smaller chick from the first egg is often unable to compete for food, dying of starvation within a short time.Scientists think this genetic trait has evolved as a means of ensuring at least one healthy offspring. The surviving chick is then guarded by the male and fed by the female for the first few weeks of life. After this, both parents feed the chick, taking turns hunting for food.Wandering chicks may often \u2018creche\u2019 (form groups) with other chicks if they are nearby, but they will return to the nest to be fed.

            "desc": "Funnel Web Spiders are some of the worlds most deadly spiders and are found in coastal and mountain regions of eastern and southern Australia. Funnel Web Spiders are found in two genera of the family \u2018Hadronyche\u2019 (which is not associated with any known human fatalities) and Atrax (which is known to have killed 13 people). Funnel Web Spiders are notorious for the inclusion of the Sydney funnel-web spider (Atrax robustus), native to eastern Australia. There are other genera in family \u2018Hexathelidae\u2019, however, these do not have the notorious reputation of the Funnel Web Spiders. Funnel Web spiders are found in:",
            "characteristics": "Funnel Web Spiders are medium to large in size, with a body length ranging from 1 centimetres to 5 centimetres (0.4 inches to 2 inches). Funnel Web Spiders are dark in color, ranging from black to brown, with a shiny head and thorax. Some of these spiders greatly resemble tarantulas. Female Funnel Web Spiders are stockier than males, with shorter legs and a larger abdomen, which may be brown or bluish. Funnel Web Spiders eyes are small and closely grouped.Funnel Web Spiders have fangs which point straight down and do not cross each other. They have ample venom glands that lie entirely within their chelicerae. Their chelicerae and fangs are large and powerful. Although Funnel Web Spiders are rather small compared to the true tarantulas, they should not be handled without taking substantial precautions, because their fangs have been known to penetrate fingernails and soft shoes, resulting in dangerous bites.Funnel Web Spiders are probably one of the three most dangerous spiders in the world and are regarded by some to be the most dangerous.",
            "habitat and spider webs": "Funnel Web Spiders live in burrows in sheltered positions in the ground, or in stumps, tree trunks or ferns above the ground. Their burrows are lined with a sock of opaque white silk and several strong strands of silk radiating from the entrance.",
            "diet": "Female Funnel Web Spiders can live very long lives, possibly up to 20 years. They are rarely seen except during tree felling, excavation or landscaping work.Female Funnel Web Spiders are sedentary and spend their entire lives inside the burrow, only venturing out momentarily to grab passing prey.Funnel Web Spider prey consists of insects and small vertebrates such as lizards and frogs.",
            "reproduction": "Young Funnel Web Spiders are raised inside the burrow. After the first couple of molts female Funnel Web Spiders leave the maternal burrow, dispersing on foot to build their own burrow.Juvenile male spiders remain in the burrow until their final adult molt. Males mature at 2 \u2013 3 years then vacate the burrow in search of a mate.",
            "venom": "While some very venomous spiders may give dry bites, Funnel Web Spiders do so much less frequently. It appears that approximately 10% to 25% of their bites will produce toxicity, however, the likelihood cannot be predicted and all should be treated as potentially life-threatening.Bites from Funnel Web Spiders have caused 13 deaths (seven in children). In all cases where the gender of the biting spider could be determined, it was found to be the male of the species. Most victims were young, ill or infirm.There is a large number of different toxins in the venom of Funnel Web Spiders. Collectively, the toxins are given the name atracotoxins (ACTX), as all these spiders belong to the subfamily Atracinae.Although extremely toxic to primates, the venom appears to be fairly harmless to many other animals, including dogs, cats, horses, rabbits, guinea-pigs, chickens and even cane toads. It has been suggested that these animals may be resistant to the venoms effects.The females venom was thought to be only about a sixth as potent to humans as that of the male, however, recent research has proven this untrue. The bite of a female or juvenile may be serious, however, considerable variability occurs in venom toxicity between species.Early symptoms of a Funnel Web spider bite include tingling around the mouth and tongue, facial muscle twitching, nausea, vomiting, profuse sweating, salivation and shortness of breath. Patients may rapidly develop agitation, confusion and coma associated with hypertension, metabolic acidosis, dilation of the pupils, generalised muscle twitching and pulmonary edema. Death results from progressive hypotension or possibly raised intracranial pressure resulting from cerebral edema.The onset of severe envenoming is rapid. In one prospective study, the median time to onset of envenoming was 28 minutes, with only two cases having onset after 2 hours (both had pressure immobilization bandages applied). Deaths may occur within a period ranging from 15 minutes (this occurred when a small child was bitten) to 3 days.Funnel web spider venom is highly toxic and all species should be considered potentially dangerous. Males wander at night, especially during or after rain and may enter houses.Articles that Mention Funnel Web SpidersList of Spiders in AustraliaList of Venomous Spiders"

Like its cousin, the Short-eared Owl, it is almost entirely nocturnal, and rarely seen. One important thing to understand about the Barn Owl is that they fall into a whole separate classification of owl, different from any other type. In this unique family are included the Barn Owl, Grass Owl, Sooty Owl, Bay Owl, and Masked Owl. All of these species are within the family scientifically known as \u2018Tytonidae\u2019 (Pronounced Tie-tawn-e-dee), or \u2018Barn Owls\u2019.

The black tipped shark is a large, fairly stout shark that is grey in color and normally has black-tipped fins, hence the name. The black tipped shark has a long, narrow, pointed snout, long gill slits, a large first dorsal fin and fairly large second dorsal. Like its close relative the spinner shark, the black tipped shark is a fast swimming shark. The black tipped shark is capable not only of breaching (leaping out of the water) but also of rotating (spinning) several times before re-entering the water.The black tipped shark is non-aggressive and would be unlikely to attack humans without being provoked. Black tipped sharks feed mainly on a wide range of bony fish including sardines, herring, mullet, jacks and Spanish mackerel, among others. They also feed upon the young of other sharks including dusky sharks and some cephalopods (mollusks) and crustaceans such as lobsters, crabs, shrimp, crayfish and barnacles."

Brown noddy terns have a greyish-white cap. The Brown Noddy Tern is another interesting seabird which can be encountered in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands of Fernandina, Baltra and Wolf. One of its most interesting qualities is that noddies perch on the heads of brown pelicans attempting to capture any fish that escaped from the bill of a fishing pelican. Although by seabird standards, the noddy tern is a medium sized bird, it is still a surprisingly large bird to be perching on the head of a pelican."

Bryde\u2019s whales are named for Johan Bryde, a Norwegian who built the first whaling stations in South Africa in the early 20th century. \u201cBryde\u2019s\u201d is pronounced \u201cbroo-dess\u201d. They belong to the genus Balaenoptera and the order Cetacea. Bryde\u2019s whales are currently considered monotypic (belonging to one species). Currently, there are two subspecies of Bryde\u2019s whales. Eden\u2019s whale (Balaenoptera edeni) is a smaller form found in the Indian and western Pacific oceans, primarily in coastal waters. The Brydes whale (Balaenoptera edeni brydei) is a larger form, found primarily in pelagic waters. Sometimes they are seen as separate species, although often, they are both labelled as Bryde\u2019s whales. Brydes whales are small by rorqual standards and weigh no more than about 25 tons although they are larger than the minke whale and very streamlined. Some populations of Bryde\u2019s whales make short migratory movements with the seasons, while others do not migrate, making them unique among other migrating baleen whales.",

            "bryde\u2019s whale diet": "Bryde\u2019s whales are different to other whales in their feeding habits. They have a generalist diet, which enables them to stay year-round in warm waters where they can always find food. Although they retain the characteristic plates of whalebone that the baleen whales use to sieve small creatures from the waters, their diet is composed almost entirely of fish. They eat school fish such as herring, mackerel, anchovies, pilchards, and sardines, and also eat, crustaceans, krill, copepods, red crabs and shrimp.They also use lunging and bubble nets alongside skimming to catch their prey. Bryde\u2019s whales eat an estimated 1,320 to 1,450 pounds of food per day, which equates to about 4% of their body weight.",
            "bryde\u2019s whale behavior": "Bryde\u2019s whales are solitary animals and are usually seen alone or in pairs. Despite this, as many as 200 individuals have been seen together in feeding areas. They\u2019ll also mix with other whale species while feeding.Although it is uncommon for these whales to produce a visible blow, they occasionally do. Bryde\u2019s whales can blow water 10 to 13 feet into the air when at the water\u2019s surface. They sometimes exhale while underwater as well.They spend most of the day within 50 feet of the water\u2019s surface and swim for about 1 to 4 miles an hour, at a speed of around 12 to 15 miles per hour. They dive for about 5 to 15 minutes, with a maximum dive duration of 20 minutes, and can reach depths up to 1,000 feet. They do not display their flukes when diving. Bryde\u2019s whales can change directions unexpectedly when swimming.These whales are known to emit short, powerful sounds that have low frequencies. They sound like moans. Whales call back and forth to each other, but the baleen whales to not use echolocation.The movements within their home range depend on the presence of food rather than breeding. Bryde\u2019s whales do not defend a territory.",
            "brydes whale reproduction": "It is assumed that Bryde\u2019s whales have similar breeding habits to other cetaceans and are believed to breed year round. They become sexually mature when they are 10 to 12 m long and 10 to 13 years old. Their gestation period is estimated to be 12 months, and females give birth to one calf per season. Calves are about 4 metres long at birth and weigh 1,000 kilograms.The calf nurses for around 6 months. At the end of the weaning period, the mother leaves the calf to fend for itself. Once the mother has given birth to a calf, she won\u2019t breed again for another year.",

They are also listed on Conservation on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix I, which prohibits international trade.Bryde\u2019s whales are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), which prohibits the removal of marine mammals from U.S. waters and their importation into the U.S. Their biggest threats are commercial whaling, collisions with vessels and becoming entangled in fishing gear. There is worry climate change will change the ecosystem in their waters, too, which will affect their food sources. Noise pollution underwater may also have an effect on these animals, because it interferes with their ability to communicate with one another, find food and avoid predators.Unfrotuntely, because Bryde\u2019s whales look similar to minke whales, they are often mistaken and caught for food.",

Its beak is curved downward, larger and more curved than most other doves. The Galapagos Doves curved beak helps it feed mainly on seeds picked from the ground mainly from the Opuntia cactus. Cactus pulp forms part of their diet and is probably their main source of water. The Galapagos Dove is endemic to the islands and is found in the more arid parts of the main islands. A process of evolution on Genovesa Island has softened the spines of cactus plants and thereby allowed the Galapagos dove access to pollinate the flowers.

            "desc": "The fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) is a cetacean belonging to the parvorder of baleen whales. It is also known as the finback whale or common rorqual and formerly the razorback whale. The fin whale is the second largest whale and the second largest living animal after the blue whale. At least two recognized subspecies exist, in the North Atlantic and the Southern Hemisphere. The fin whale is found in all the worlds major oceans, from polar to tropical waters. This marine mammal is absent only from waters close to the ice pack at both the north and south poles and relatively small areas of water away from the open ocean. The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters. Only few sightings of the fin whale have been confirmed. The best place for an observation would be the western archipelago of the Galapagos. Like all other large whales, the fin whale was heavily hunted during the 20th century and, due to this, the fin whale is an endangered species. The global population of the whale is estimated to range from less than 100,000 to roughly 119,000.",
            "fin whale history and taxonomy": "The fin whale was first described by Friderich Martens in 1675 and then again by Paul Dudley in 1725. The word physalus comes from the Greek word physa, meaning \u201cblows\u201d, referring to the prominent blow of the species.Fin whales are rorquals (members of the family Balaenopteridae) which also includes other species of whale, such as the humpback whale, the blue whale, Bryde\u2019s whale, the sei whale, and the minke whales. DNA evidence indicates the fin whale may be closely related to the humpback whale.There are two subspecies of fin whale as of 2006; the northern fin whale, B. p. physalus, inhabits the North Atlantic and the southern fin whale, B. p. quoyi, occupies the Southern Hemisphere. Experts also believe there is a third subspecies inhabiting the North Pacific, but this subspecies is yet to be named.There are hybrid individuals between blue and fin whales with characteristics of both that are known to occur in both the North Atlantic and North Pacific. This is despite the genetic distance between the blue and fin whales being compared to that between a gorilla and a human.Fin Whale CharacteristicsThe fin whale is usually distinguished by its great length and slender build. In the Northern Hemisphere, the average size of adult males and females is about 18.5 and 20 metres (61 and 66 ft), respectively, averaging 38.5 and 50.5 tonnes (42.5 and 55.5 tons), while in the Southern Hemisphere, it is 20.5 and 22 m (67 and 72 ft), weighing 52.5 and 63 tonnes (58 and 69.5 tons).Full physical maturity is not reached until between 25 and 30 years of age. A newborn fin whale measures about 6.5 metres (21 feet) in length and weighs approximately 1,800 kilograms (4,000 pounds). The animal\u2019s large size aids in identification and it is usually only confused with the blue whale, the sei whale or Bryde\u2019s whale.The fin whale has a brownish grey top and sides and a whitish underside. The head is quite flat and represents about 1/5 of total body length. It has a pointed snout, paired blowholes and a broad, flat rostrum. Two lighter-colored chevrons begin midline behind the blowholes and slant down the sides toward the tail on a diagonal upward to the dorsal fin, sometimes re-curving forward on the back. The fin whale has a large white patch on the right side of the lower jaw, while the left side of the jaw is grey or black.The fin whale has a series of 56 to 100 pleats or grooves along the bottom of the body that run from the tip of the chin to the navel that allow the throat area to expand greatly during feeding.The fin whale has a curved, prominent dorsal fin about three-quarters of the way along the back. This usually measures around 60 centimetres (24 inches). Its flippers are small and tapered and its tail is wide, pointed at the tip and notched in the centre.An adult fin whale has between 262 and 473 baleen plates on each side of the mouth. Each plate is made of keratin that frays out into fine hairs on the ends inside the mouth near the tongue. Each plate can measure up to 76 centimetres (30 inches) in length and 30 centimetres (12 inches) in width.",
            "fin whale lifespan": "Fin whales have a lifespan of around 94 years of age, but specimens have been found aged at an estimated 135 to 140 years.",
            "fin whale location and habitat": "The fin whale is a cosmopolitan species, meaning it is found in all the world\u2019s major oceans and in waters ranging from the polar to the tropical. The only water it is absent from are close to the ice pack at both the north and south extremities and relatively small areas of water away from the large oceans, such as the Red Sea. However, they can reach into the Baltic Sea.The highest population of fin whales occurs in temperate and cool waters, and is less densely populated in the warmer waters. They tend to live in coastal and shelf waters but never in water less than 200 meters deep.Fin whales are migratory and move seasonally in and out of high-latitude feeding areas, but the overall migration pattern is not well understood. Most migrate from the Arctic and Antarctic feeding areas in the summer to tropical breeding and calving areas in the winter. The location of winter breeding grounds is not known. Fin whales travel in the open seas, away from the coast, so they are difficult to track.",
            "fin whale diet": "The fin whale is a filter-feeder, feeding on plankton and small schooling fish, squid and crustaceans including mysids (shrimp-like creatures) and krill. It feeds by opening its jaws while swimming at a relatively high speed. Its speed causes it to engulf up to 18,000 gallons of water in one gulp. It then closes its jaws and pushes the water back out of its mouth through its baleen, which allows the water to leave while trapping the prey. Each gulp provides the whale with approximately 10 kilograms (20 pounds) of krill.Fin whales have also been observed circling schools of fish at high speed, compacting the school into a tight ball, then turning on its side before engulfing the fish.Fin whales fast in the winter while they migrate to warmer waters, but in the summer can consume up to 1,800 kilograms (4,000 pounds) of food a day. This leads scientists to conclude that the whale spends about three hours a day feeding to meet its energy requirements, which is roughly the same as humans. However, if prey patches are not sufficiently dense, or are located too deep in the water, then a whale has to spend a larger portion of its day searching for food.",
            "fin whale behaviour": "Fin whales are more gregarious than other rorquals and often live in groups of 6 to 10 individuals, although on the feeding grounds groups of up to 100 animals may be observed.Like other whales, the male fin whale has been observed to make long, loud, low-frequency sounds. The vocalizations of blue whales and fin whales are the lowest known sounds made by any animal, ranging from 16 to 40 Hz, which is outside of the hearing range of humans. Each sound lasts one to two seconds, and various sound combinations occur in patterned sequences lasting 7 to 15 minutes each. Fin whale songs can penetrate over 2,500 m (8,200 ft) below the sea floor and seismologists can use those song waves to assist in underwater surveys.The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters. The fin whale is less densely populated in the hottest, equatorial regions. It prefers deep waters beyond the continental shelf to shallow waters.The fin whale is one of the fastest cetaceans and can sustain speeds of 37 kilometres per hour (23 miles per hour) and bursts in excess of 40 kilometres per hour (25 miles per hour) have been recorded, earning the fin whale the nickname \u2018the greyhound of the sea\u2019.",
            "fin whale breathing": "When travelling or resting, the fin whale will blow every minute or two, but when feeding, they will blow 5 to 7 times in quick succession. When the whale surfaces, the dorsal fin is visible soon after the spout. Their spout is vertical and narrow and can reach heights of 6 metres. The fin whale will blow one to several times on each visit to the surface, staying close to the surface for about one and a half minutes each time.Their tail remains submerged during the surfacing sequence. The fin whale then dives to depths of up to 250 metres (820 feet), each dive lasting between 10 and 15 minutes. Fin whales have also been known to leap completely out of the water.",
            "fin whale reproduction": "Mating occurs in temperate, low-latitude seas during the winter and the gestation period is eleven months to one year. Fin whales are seen in pairs during the breeding season and are believed to be monogamous. A male will chase a female while emitting a series of repetitive, low-frequency vocalizations. These sounds travel far, which is important because fin whales do not have specific mating grounds and must communicate to find each other.Females reproduce every 2 to 3 years, with as many as 6 calves being reported, however, single births are far more common. The gestation period is 11 to 11.5 months. Calves are precocial at birth and able to swim immediately after. They are normally born at an average length of 6 meters and weighing 3,500 to 3,600 kilograms.Since the calf does not have the ability to suckle like land mammals, the mother must spray the milk into the mouth of the baby by contracting the circular muscles at the base of the nipple sinus. Feeding takes place at 8 to 10 minute intervals throughout the day. A newborn weans from its mother at 6 or 7 months of age when it is 11 or 12 metres (36 to 39 feet) in length, and the calf follows the mother to the winter feeding ground.Female fin whales reach sexual maturity at between 3 and 12 years of age. Calves remain with their mother for around one year.Fin Whale Conservation StatusFin whales are listed as \u2018endangered\u2019 on the IUCN Red List. Their global population is estimated to be between 100,000 to 119,000. The biggest reasons for the decline in their population are fishing, whaling, vessel strikes and climate change.",
            "fin whale threats": "Whaling is the largest cause of declining fin whale populations. The fin whale was heavily hunted during the 20th century, with over 725,000 fin whales reportedly taken from the Southern Hemisphere between 1905 and 1976. As of 1997 only 38,000 survived.Historically, fin whales were hunted for their oil and blubber, as well as their baleen. Aboriginal peoples have hunted fin whales for centuries and all parts of the whale were integral in their lives as a source of food, fuel, and building materials. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) issued a ban on commercial hunting of the fin whale in 1986, although Iceland and Japan have resumed hunting.Fin whales are injured or killed in vessel collisions, too. This is especially true in the Mediterranean Sea where collisions are a significant source of fin whale mortality. Between 2000 and 2004, 5 fatal collisions with vessels were recorded off the east coast of the United States.Fishing gear also kills fin whales, with entanglement resulting in at least one death per year. Fishing accidents have killed 4 fin whales in the years 2000 to 2004.A study done on whale calls shows that human sound can also interfere with whale populations, because it can prevent mating. Since the whales use low frequency sounds to call to females, human interruption through sound waves, such as military sonar and seismic surveys can disrupt the signal sent to the females. This potentially can result in mates not meeting and a reduction in birth rates in populations.Climate change is affecting whale populations as it has a direct effect on oceanographic conditions. As the conditions of the sea change, so does prey distribution could lead to changes in foraging behavior, nutritional stress, and diminished reproduction for fin whales. Temperature changes also affects the timing of environmental cues important for navigation and foraging in fin whales.Fin whales suffer from a number of pathological conditions. Parasites can burrow into their blubber to feed on their blood and attach themselves to their fins. Worms and barnacles can also cause health issues within fin whales.",
            "fin whale predators": "Fin whales have natural predators in the ocean, despite their size. The only known predator of the fin whale is the killer whale, with at least 20 eyewitness and second-hand accounts of attack or harassment. However, only a few confirmed fatalities have occurred. Orcas usually attack a fin whale in groups and feed on its carcass once it has been killed.Young fin whales are more likely to be attacked than adults, although adults are likely to be successful in defending their young.",
            "fin whale ecosystem role": "The fin whale is important to the ecosystem because it helps to control plankton levels through its diet. Their carcasses also support communities of benthic animals as they fall to the ocean floor and are consumed. Fin whales host large communities of parasites, such as barnacles, lice, and worms, too.\u00a0"

All of Darwin\u2019s Finches are sparrow sized and similar in appearance with grey, brown, black or olive feathers. Darwin\u2019s Finches are named after the great biologist Charles Darwin, the explorer who discovered the theory of evolution on the Galapagos Isles during a voyage in 1835. Here are the names of all 14 of Darwin\u2019s Finches. They are divided into 4 groups: Genus Geospiza:",
            "darwin\u2019s finch diet": "Darwin\u2019s Finches vary by what they eat, some eat seeds and others eat insects. The Ground Finches eat ticks which they remove with their crushing beaks from Tortoises, Land Iguanas and Marine Iguanas and they kick eggs into rocks to feed upon their contents. On one Galapagos Island (Isla Wolf) the Vampire Finch, a sub species of the Sharp Beaked Ground Finch, jumps on the backs of other birds such as Masked Boobies and Red-footed Boobies and peck away at their flesh to feed on their blood. The booby birds do not resist against this eating behaviour. It is thought that this behaviour evolved from the pecking behaviour that the finch used to clean parasites from the plumage of the booby birds. The Vampire Finch is an endangered species.Woodpecker and Mangrove Finches use small twigs and cactus spines as tools to dine on the larva stored in dead tree branches.Although they have adapted to allow for specialized feeding, most Finches are generalized eaters. The specialized feeding developed allowing the birds to survive during the dry season or times of drought when little food is available.These specialized tools allow the birds a better advantage when they compete for food sources with other birds and animals.",
            "darwin\u2019s finches reproduction": "Finches generally mate for the first time at the age of 1 year old. However, it has been recorded that there was a breeding of two species of Darwin\u2019s finches on the Galapagos Islands at the age of 3 \u2013 6 months.Reproduction of Darwin\u2019s finches is closely associated with rainfall. Since rainfall on Galapagos is very variable, birds have been found breeding at many times of the year.Very little is known about the reproduction of the 14 species of Finches on the islands, however, rain seasons and food production are known to effect their breeding cycles. The Finches are thought to hatch eggs on a 2 \u2013 3 year cycle."

Long legs and a long, curved neck are characteristic of all flamingo species. All flamingos are found in tropical and subtropical areas. Galapagos Flamingos reside in the salt-water lagoons hidden in the lava fields behind the coast of the Galapagos Islands. The Galapagos Flamingo measures 120 \u2013 140 centimetres in length, males weigh 2.8 kilograms and females 2.2 kilograms. Most of their plumage is pink, giving rise to its earlier name of Rosy Flamingo and differentiating adults from the much paler European species. The wing coverts are red and the primary and secondary flight feathers are black. A flamingos beak is pink with a restricted black tip and the legs are entirely pink. A flamingos call is a goose-like honking. Flamingos filter-feed on brine shrimp. Their oddly-shaped beaks are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they consume and are uniquely used upside-down. The filtering of food items is assisted by hairy structures called lamellae which line the mandibles and the large rough-surfaced tongue. Flamingos also feed on small crustaceans (shelled fish).",

            "diet and feeding": "The flamingos diet of tiny water plants and crustaceans is full of substances called \u2018carotenoids\u2019. These carotenoid pigments cause flamingos feathers to turn pink. It is mostly the pigment in the crustaceans that is responsible for their beautiful pink coloring. The more their diet contains these substances the pinker they become. Flamingos filter out the small crustaceans with their heads upside down.",
            "behaviour": "Flamingos frequently stand on one leg. The reason for this behaviour is not fully known. One common theory is that tucking one leg beneath the body may conserve body heat, however, this has not been proven. It is often suggested that this is done in part to keep the legs from getting wet and in addition to conserving energy. In addition to standing in the water, flamingos may stamp their webbed feet in the mud to stir up food from the bottom.Flamingos build nest mounds made of mud, small stones, straw and feathers. Both females and males use their beaks in building their nests. These mounds may be as high as 12 inches high because they serve as protection against the extreme heat and flooding that occurs at ground level.",
            "reproduction": "Flamingos usually lay just one large egg and both male and female take turns incubating the egg by sitting on the nest. Incubation time is between 21 \u2013 36 days.Because there are no regular breeding seasons, chicks hatch throughout the year. Newly hatched chicks have grey or white down feathers and a straight red beak. Their pink feathers begin to show after a two or three year period. Flamingos do not begin to breed until they are 6 years old.Flamingos produce a \u2018milk\u2019 like pigeon milk due to the action of a hormone called prolactin. It contains more fat and less protein than pigeon milk and it is produced in glands lining the whole of the upper digestive tract, not just the crop. Both parents nurse their chick and young flamingos feed on this milk, which also contains red and white blood cells, for about two months until their bills are developed enough to filter feed. In the wild, flamingos can live until they are 50 years old.",
            "flamingo conservation status": "The Caribbean Flamingo is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. Caribbean Flamingos are currently classed as \u2018Least Concern\u2019.",

Both belong to the family Tyrannidae and both are endemic to the Galapagos Islands. The Galapagos archipelago is located about 1,000 km from continental Ecuador in South America and is composed of 127 islands. The Galapagos flycatcher is present on all the main islands, while the vermillion flycatcher can be seen on the uninhabited islands of Fernandina Island, Isabela Island, Santa Cruz Island and Rabida Island. The little vermillion flycatcher was first discovered in Galapagos during Charles Darwin\u2019s voyage on HMS Beagle, and from Darwin\u2019s specimens two endemic subspecies were identified: P.r.nanus, found on all islands but San Cristobal, and P.r.dubius, found only on San Cristobal.

Their song begins with a \u2018whey-bur\u2019, which is followed by multiple \u2018huit\u2019 noises.Despite this, they are solitary birds and spend life alone or in breeding pairs. Galapagos birds are also very territorial birds, which means that their nests cannot be too close to each other.",
            "galapagos flycatching birds reproduction": "The Galapagos flycatching birds breed throughout the year, but most commonly the breeding season is between January and March, which is the hot and humid season. However, some may nest as early as November or as late as May.Their nests are constructed with vegetable matter and are usually placed in trees or cacti. They are then lined with soft plant material, feathers (such as chicken feathers), feather down and hair. Breeding birds have been known to pull hairs from animals to construct their nests, and sometimes even humans! Because they are territorial, there is at least 328 ft (100 m) distance between the nests of these birds.Galapagos flycatching birds will lay a clutch of between 3 and 6 brown-marked buff eggs. Once hatched, the young flycatchers will leave the next when they are around 13 days old.",

This is due to a phenomenon seen in many island ecosystems where gigantism evolves because there is no longer any need to hide from predators and because there are no other similar animals to compete with for food. Once the tortoises spread around the archipelago, they evolved on their isolated islands into the different races we see today, some with domed carapaces (shells), and others with saddleback carapaces. The unusual saddle shape is believed to have evolved several times on different islands, showing that it must be a very successful design for life in Galapagos.There are only 15,000 tortoises left on the islands today, the different sub-species scattered around the different islands, whereas there used to be around 250,000.",

This means that they are able to go without eating or drinking for up to one year.Giant Tortoises can also survive for long periods of time being forcefully deprived of all liquids, by breaking down their body fat to produce water.",
            "giant tortoise behaviour": "Like other reptiles, Galapagos tortoises are cold-blooded animals. They spend much of their day soaking up the sun to warm themselves. When the sun goes down and the temperature cools, tortoises sleep partially submerged in mud, water or brush to keep warm. Tortoises are extremely peaceful creatures.The tortoises are slow-moving reptiles with an average long-distance walking speed of 0.3 km/h. However, although feeding giant tortoises move about slowly, browsing with no apparent direction, if they have a purpose, such as moving to water or nesting grounds, they can move with surprising speed and determination given their size. Marked individuals have been reported to have traveled 8 miles in 2 to 3 days.Tortoises have a classic example of a mutualism symbiotic relationship with some species of Galapagos finch. The finch hops in front of the tortoise to show that it is ready and the tortoise then raises itself up high on its legs and stretches out its neck so that the bird can reach ticks on its skin, therefore freeing the tortoise from harmful parasites and providing the finch with an easy meal. Other birds, including Galapagos Hawk and flycatchers, often use tortoises as observation posts from which to sight their prey.",
            "reproduction": "Mating occurs at any time of the year although it does have seasonal peaks, usually between January and August. When two mature males meet in the mating season, they will rise up on their legs and stretch up their necks to assess dominance. The shorter tortoise will retreat leaving the taller, larger tortoise to mate with the female. In groups of tortoises from mixed island populations, saddleback males have an advantage over domebacks. Frustrated non-dominant males have been observed attempting to mate with other males and boulders.The male tortoise bellows loudly and bobs his head to attract a female. The male then rams the female with the front of its shell and nips her exposed legs until she draws them in, immobilizing her. Mating may last for several hours and the males may \u2018roar\u2019 hoarsely. Males have a concave base to their shell and mount the females from behind. It brings its tail which houses the penis into females cloaca.After mating (between June and December), the females journey several kilometres to reach nesting areas of dry, sandy ground (often near the coast). Nest digging is an elaborate task and takes several hours sometimes spread out over several days. It is carried out blindly using only the hind legs to dig a 30 centimetre deep hole, in which it lays two to sixteen hard-shelled eggs the size of tennis balls (the number varies with population). The female makes a muddy plug for the nest hole out of soil mixed with urine and leaves the eggs to incubate.The young emerge from the nest 120 to 140 days later (between December and April) and may weigh only 80 grams and measure 6 centimetres. Temperature plays a role in the sex of the hatchling: if the nest temperature is low, more males will hatch; if it is high, more females will hatch. When the young tortoises emerge from their shells, they must dig their way to the surface, which can take up to one month. Hawks are probably the only native predator of the tortoise hatchlings.Sex can be determined when the tortoise is 15 years old, and sexual maturity is reached at 20 to 25 years old. The tortoises grow slowly for about 40 years until they reach their full size.",

Of the two, the Great Frigate bird has the greater world-wide distribution, being found primarily throughout the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans. The Magnificent Frigate bird is found in the Caribbean and on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the Americas. The Galapagos population of Magnificent Frigate birds is considered to be an endemic subspecies. In the Galapagos, the two species can be seen nesting side by side, but when Frigate birds are sighted in the air, they typically are Magnificent Frigate birds, as Great Frigate birds tend to forage much further out at sea. As with the three similar species of Booby birds, similar species of Frigate Birds avoid competition by feeding in different locations."

The adult turtles algae diet is responsible for the color in its tissues.Green Sea Turtles body is wonderfully adapted to life in the ocean. Their shells are lighter and more streamlined than those of their terrestrial counterparts and their front and rear limbs have evolved into flippers making them efficient and graceful swimmers, capable of swimming long distances in a relatively short period of time. Green Sea Turtles have been known to move through the water as fast as 35 miles per hour. The Turtles sometimes emerge on to land to bask in the sun.Green Sea Turtles are cold-bloodied. Adult green turtles are known to grow up to one and a half metres long. While individuals have been caught that reached weights of up to 315 kilograms (694 pounds), the average weight of mature individuals is around 200 kilograms (440 pounds). The largest Green Sea Turtle ever recorded weighed 395 kilograms (871 pounds).The Green Sea Turtles shell is actually its skeleton. Unlike its cousin, the Tortoise, the Green Sea Turtle cannot retract its small head into its shell for protection from dangerous sea creatures.Sea turtles have come up with an ingenious way to rid their bodies of the salts they accumulate from the seawater in which they live. Just behind each eye is a salt gland. Their salt glands help sea turtles to maintain a healthy water balance by shedding large \u2018tears\u2019 of excess salt. If a sea turtle appears to be \u2018crying\u2019 it is usually not cause for alarm, as the turtles are merely keeping their physiology in check. It is not because they are upset or sad.",
            "green sea turtle reproduction": "Green Sea Turtles spend most of their life in the ocean. The males never leave the ocean, but the females come ashore to nest and lay eggs on several of the islands.At night, the females dig pits on the sandy beach with their back flippers. They lay about 100 eggs and then they cover their pit. Green Sea Turtles leave the island and go back into the sea never returning to see their eggs. After the baby green sea turtles are about 6 months old, they start to eat algae and seaweed.",
            "green sea turtle diet": "One of the turtles favourite food is sea grass and mangrove leaves. Some of the younger turtles like to eat jellyfish, algae, shrimp and crustaceans. When Green Sea Turtles are eating, they stay under water for 5 \u2013 10 minutes. When they are resting, they can stay under the water for 2 and a half hours without coming up for air. Young turtles usually sleep on the surface of the water.",
            "green sea turtle conservation": "Several populations of this species exist and all are in a vulnerable state. Green Sea Turtles are an endangered species. Turtle eggs are eaten by introduced mammals. Pigs and other animals frequently destroy their nests. Hawks, Herons, Mockingbirds and Frigatebirds prey on young hatchlings. If these young turtles make it to the sea, fish and sharks hunt them also."

It is the most widespread of all bats in the United States and, though not yet recorded in Alaska, these bats are thought to occur in all 50 states. They also live in both Central America and South America, and are the only bats found in Hawaii. The hoary bat was described as a new species in 1796 by Palisot de Beauvois. It belongs to the order Chiroptera and the genus Lasiurus. Because the hoary bat is so widespread, they are not considered dangerous and are listed as Least Concern by the IUCN.",
            "hoary bat lifespan": "The average life span of a hoary bat is thought to be between 6 and 7 years.",
            "diet": "Hoary bats generally prefer to eat moths and beetles, but are also known to consume mosquitoes during periods of high abundance. They will also eat small wasps, flies, grasshoppers, dragonflies, and termites. They may also feed on grass and leaves. Hoary bats use echolocation to locate their prey and are one of the few creatures in the world to do so.While the hoary bat prefers woodland and mainly coniferous forests for roosting, they hunt over open areas or lakes, as well as the tree tops, along streams. They approach their prey from behind, taking the abdomen and thorax in their mouth and biting off and swallowing this area of the insect, while dropping the wings and head.",
            "behavior": "The hoary bat is mainly solitary and only forms groups during migration and the mating season. Mothers and her young will be seen together and, occasionally, they can be seen forming groups when hunting for insects. They roost 3 to 5 m above ground during the day and reach their peak activity at about five hours after sunset. They fly directly and can reach speeds of thirteen miles/hr, and stop to rest between meals at night.Hoary bats are highly territorial, choosing feeding sites which they return to night after night. These bats wrap their hairy tail membrane around their curled up bodies for insulation while resting during harsh weather conditions.When disturbed while resting, the hoary bat makes a sharp hissing sound. They also make an audible chattering during flight. The Hoary Bat as well as the Galapagos Red Bat is an insectivore that flies all around but is larger and with a beautiful red fur with white tips.",
            "hoary bat location and habitat": "The hoary bat is thought to occur in all 50 states in North America, and is the only bat found in Hawaii. They are also found in Canada, as Central America and South America, including Venezuela, Colombia, Bolivia, Uruguay, Central Chile, Paraguay, Central Argentina, Brazil, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama and the Galapagos Islands.These animals are most abundant in California, Arizona, and New Mexico, and least common in the eastern United States and northern Rockies. Males and females are only found together in parts of Nebraska, Montana, and the Badlands of South Dakota. Males and females are usually separated during the warmer months in North America, except during the mating season.Hoary bats in live in trees and are thought to prefer trees at the edge of clearings. However, they have also been found in heavy forests, open wooded glades, and shade trees in more urban environments. They rely on their fur to keep themselves camouflaged.",
            "hoary bat reproduction": "The reproductive cycle of the hoary bat is not yet fully known but it is thought that they mate in August, around the autumn migration, with birth occurring in June of the following year.Copulation is followed by delayed fertilization, a process in which the sperm is stored in the female reproductive tract all winter and is available to fertilize the egg when ovulation takes place in the spring. It is thought to have a gestation period of only 40 days and litter size ranges from 1 to 4 and the young spend about one month with the mother before being able to fend for themselves.Most females have been found rearing young in deciduous trees, while males seem more likely to also roost in conifers. Both tend to prefer older trees which apparently provide greater safety, and which they use for up to 5 weeks. Most roosts are 11.5 to 40 feet above the ground, some up to 65 feet, with mothers and young usually roosting higher than solitary adults.Hoary bats give birth to their young while hanging upside down. The newborns are born with their ears and eyes closed, and they open at three and twelve days respectively. Juveniles appear nearly grayish, but still have a frosty appearance. The young cling to the mother in the day, while she sleeps, and hang on a twig or leaf while she hunts at night.",
            "hoary bat migration": "Hoary bats are long-distance migrants, and migrates to warmer areas during the winter. They often spend the winter in Central America and the southwestern United States and the spring and summer in more northern latitudes in the United States and Canada. They are believed to migrate through Florida from late October to late November and from February through early May.During their return to North America, females start their flight a month before the males. Some are believed to remain in the north and hibernate for the winter, rather than moving south of the United States like most do.Conservation StatusIt is difficult to know about the life history of this bat because it is such a solitary animal. That being said, the hoary bat is widespread and listed on the IUCN Red List as Least Concern. However, one subspecies, the Hawaiian hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus semotus), is listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.One of the biggest threats to the hoary bat population is loss of habitat due to climate change and deforestation.Hoary bats also suffer significant mortality from wind turbines. Across the United States in 2005, 40% of all bats killed by collisions with wind turbines were hoary bats\u2014over 1000 hoary bats were killed in 2005. It is thought they are attracted to the tall structures and may seem them as places to rest.Another cause of mortality in these bats is mothers falling out out of their roost with attached young, and thus becoming easy prey.",

Adults range in length from 12 to 19 meters (40 to 70 feet) and weigh approximately 36,000 kilograms (79,000 pounds). The humpback whale is the easiest baleen whale to identify, with a broad rounded head covered with tubercles or knobs. The humpback whale is found in major oceans and seas around the world. They feed in polar waters, living off krill and small fish, and migrate to tropical or subtropical waters to breed and give birth. These whales are known for being an acrobatic animal, often breaching and slapping the water. Humpback whales are rorquals, members of the Balaenopteridae family that includes the blue whale, fin whale, Bryde\u2019s whale, sei whale and minke whales. The humpback whale belongs to the order Artiodactyla.",
            "humpback whale lifespan": "The lifespan of a humpback whale can range from anywhere between 45 and 100 years.",
            "humpback whale diet": "Humpback whales filter-feed on small crustaceans (mostly krill) and small fish, such as anchovies, herring, sand lance, and sardines. They use several techniques to help them herd, corral, and disorient prey and that can include using bubbles, sounds, the seafloor, and even their pectoral fins. One of their most popular methods is bubble netting, a process in which whales either singly or cooperatively blow a circle of bubbles from under water in order to create a wall or curtain of bubbles that traps small schooling fish and makes them easier to capture in a single lunging gulp through the centre of the bubble curtain.Humpback whales feed only in summer, in polar waters and migrate to tropical or sub-tropical waters to breed and give birth in the winter. They pend most of their time feeding and building up fat stores (blubber) in the summer so, during the winter, humpbacks fast and live off their fat reserves. Despite this, there is evidence that some individuals engage in opportunistic feeding during migration.",
            "humpback whale location and habitat": "The humpback whale is found in oceans and seas around the world. They live in polar to tropical waters, including the waters of the Artic, Atlantic, and Pacific Oceans, as well as the waters surrounding Antartica and the Bering Strait.Humpbacks are divided into several populations. These are for the most part isolated, but with a little interchange in some cases. There are two stocks in the north Atlantic Ocean and two in the north Pacific. There are also seven isolated stocks in the southern hemisphere. Some scientists believe that these different populations should be considered subspecies of the humpback whale.The humpback whale performs long seasonal migrations; spending summers feeding in cold productive waters at high latitudes and winters on tropical breeding grounds where they mate, calve, and nurse their young.",
            "humpback whale migration": "The humpback whale is a migratory species and some individuals travel as far as 8,000 km between their breeding and feeding grounds. They spend their summers in cooler waters, and their winters in tropical waters.Southern Hemisphere populations generally feed around the Antarctic between November and March, and migrate toward breeding grounds near the equator where they mate and give birth between July and October. Northern Hemisphere populations do the opposite, feeding at high latitudes off the continents of North America and Europe between June and October, and mating and calving at low latitudes in the Caribbean, West Pacific and West Atlantic between December and March or April.In the North Pacific, some humpback whales migrate from Alaska to Hawaii and they can complete the 3,000 mile trip in as few as 28 days. While calving, they prefer shallow, warm waters commonly near offshore reef systems or shores. Humpback whale feeding grounds are generally in cold, productive waters.",
            "humpback whale behavior": "The humpback whales social structure is quite flexible. Usually, individuals live alone or in small groups that assemble and break up over the course of a few hours. Groups may stay together a little longer in summer in order to forage and feed together. Longer-term relationships between pairs or small groups, lasting months or even years, have been observed, but are rare.Humpbacks are a friendly species that interact with other cetaceans such as bottlenose dolphins. They can also appear in mixed groups with other species, such as the blue, fin, minke, gray and sperm whales.Occasionally, humpbacks can be aggressive. Protective or aggressive behavior includes body thrashing, horizontal tail lashing, and lobtailing. This aggression may also be directed at boats for coming near the groups. In general, groups of whales are more aggressive than individual whales.Humpback whales swim around 27 km per hour, but during migration this can become even faster \u2014 3.8 to 14.3 km per hour. Whales with calves swim the slowest, whereas lone whales travel faster than those in groups.Both male and female humpback whales can produce sounds, however only male humpbacks produce the long, loud, complex songs for which the species is famous. Each song consists of several sounds in a low register (range of a note) that vary in amplitude (measure of a wave) and frequency, and typically lasts from 10 to 20 minutes. Songs may be repeated continuously for several hours. Humpback whales have been observed to sing continuously for more than 24 hours at a time. As cetaceans have no vocal chords, whales generate their song by forcing air through their massive nasal cavities. The purpose of the song is not yet clear, although it appears to have a role in mating.Whales are air-breathing mammals who must surface to get the air they need. These whales usually dive 6 to 7 m for 15 to 20 minutes at a time. Blows (exhalations) are not regular and flukes are not lifted as the whale dives. However, during a longer dive, the flukes are lifted and they will surface between dives for about 4 minutes, while blowing regularly. Their blow is usually a 3 m (9.8 ft), heart-shaped bushy blow.The humpback whale does not generally sleep at the surface, but they must continue to breathe. Possibly only half of their brain sleeps at one time, with one half managing the surface-blow-dive process without awakening the other half.",
            "humpback whale reproduction": "The humpback whale breeding season is in the winter, and takes place in tropical waters. This is usually July to October in the Southern Hemisphere and December to March in the Northern Hemisphere. A pregnant female will swims thousands of kilometers to temperate waters and will arrive earlier than males, non-pregnant females and juveniles.Female humpback whales typically breed every two or three years, yet some individuals can breed in two consecutive years. Humpbacks appear to possess a polygynous/polygamous mating system, with males competing aggressively for access to oestrous females. Whale song plays an important role in mate selection.Their gestation period is 11.5 months, and females produce a single calf. Newborn humpback calves are roughly the length of their mothers head. A 50 foot mother would have a 20 foot newborn weighing in at 2 tons. They are nursed by their mothers for approximately six months, then are sustained through a mixture of nursing and independent feeding for possibly six months more.Mothers are protective of their calves, swimming closely and often touching them with their flippers. While calves are not believed to maintain long-term associations with their mothers, they are more likely to be found in the same feeding and breeding areas as their mothers.Female humpback whales reach sexual maturity at the age of five with full adult size being achieved a little later. According to new research, males reach sexual maturity at approximately 7 years of age.Humpback Whale Conservation StatusHumpback whales are estimated to have a worldwide population of 84,000 and increasing. Regional estimates are 18,000 to 20,000 in the North Pacific, 12,000 in the North Atlantic and over 50,000 in the Southern Hemisphere.Humpback whales were historically hunted in the 20th century, almost to the point of extinction. The United States listed all humpback whales as endangered under the Endangered Species Conservation Act in 1970 and then under the Endangered Species Act in 1973.Fortunately, the International Whaling Commission\u2019s final whaling moratorium on commercial harvest, in effect since 1985, played a major role in the recovery of humpback whales. Now, they are listed as Least Concern by the IUCN Red List.",
            "humpback whale predators": "Humpback whales have few predators other than humans. Sometimes they are harassed and possibly even killed by killer whales. Humpback whales often bear rake-like scars on their bodies indicating that they survived an attack by killer whales. They can also be preyed on by some species of shark.",
            "humpback whale threats": "While commercial whaling no longer threatens the humpback whale population, they are threatened by other factors, such as climate change, entanglement with fishing gear, collisions with vessels and excessive noise.While humpback whales are conservative whales and will not approach boats, there are many reports of them being killed by moving boats. They can also become entangled in moorings, traps, pots, or gillnets. If they are entangled in this gear and unable to move, the whale may drag and swim with attached gear for long distances, which can cause harm or even death.Climate change is considered one of the biggest threats to whales because, as the climate alters, so will their habitat and way of living. This can affect feeding, breeding, navigation and migration.\u00a0"

It has a black and white patterned body and has been made famous by films such as Free Willy and Blackfish. These animals can be found all over the world and are only absent from the Baltic and Black seas, and some areas of the Arctic Ocean. Orcas are a popular animal and attraction at marine theme parks, and, while wild orcas have never been known to attack humans, there have been incidents of captive orcas attacking and killing trainers at these parks. This has lead to a worldwide discussion on the ethics of keeping these large animals in captivity, particularly for entertainment purposes instead of conservation purposes. Orcas are fascinating creatures, but unfortunately there is worry about their conservation status. Let\u2019s explore more about the orca below and see what there is to learn.",

The three types that are currently identified are the resident orca, the transient or Bigg\u2019s orca, and the offshore orca.The resident orca is the most commonly sighted orca and is found in the coastal waters of the northeast Pacific. They normally visit the same areas constantly. The transient killer whale roams widely along the coast, having been sighted in both southern Alaska and California. They are usually seen in small groups of between two to six orcas. Transient and resident orcas live in the same area, but avoid each other.Offshore orcas travel far from the shore, hence their name, and are normally seen in groups of 20\u201375. They are mostly seen off the west coast of Vancouver Island and near Haida Gwaii.There have also been three, possibly four, types of orcas documented in the Antarctic, which differ in size, shape and pattern. They also have different diets and feed on different prey.Male killer whales are called bulls, female killer whales are called cows, and baby killer whales are called calves.",

Females are smaller, around 5 to 7 m (16 to 23 ft) long and weigh about 3 to 4 tonnes. Orca calves are around 180 kg (400 lb) and are about 2.4 m (7.9 ft) long at birth.Being the most distinctively pigmented cetacean, you can\u2019t mistake these animals! The orcas has a striking black and white body, with a mostly black back (dorsal) and white underside. They are also white around their jaw, but the white narrows between the flippers. Males and females have different patterns of black and white skin in their genital areas, and young orcas can look yellowish in color. As calves, they are born with a yellowish or orange tint, which fades to white.They have very large rounded pectoral fins which resemble paddles and males have larger fins than females. Both males and females also have dorsal fins, although the male\u2019s is about 1.8\u00a0m (5.9\u00a0ft) high and twice the size of the female\u2019s. The male\u2019s is also taller and more elongated than the female\u2019s, which is shorter and more curved.Killer whales have very strong jaws and sharp teeth, with the upper teeth falling into the gaps between the lower teeth when the mouth is closed. The back and middle teeth help to hold the orca\u2019s prey in place. Their snout is also blunt and rounded.Orcas have a white patch just behind their eyes and a grey or white \u201csaddle patch\u201d exists behind the dorsal fin and across the back. They have good eyesight both above and below the water, and very good hearing. They use echolocation to detect the location and characteristics of their prey.They also have a good sense of touch and a layer of insulating blubber ranging from 7.6 to 10\u00a0cm (3.0 to 3.9\u00a0in) thick beneath the skin to help keep them warm.",
            "lifespan": "The lifespan of wild female orcas is between 50 to 80 years old, while wild males tend to live shorter. The average age a male will live to is 29, although the maximum could be up to 60 years. It is thought that orcas that live in capacity generally live a shorter life, but this is up for scientific debate.Female orcas are among the few animals that undergo menopause and live for decades after they have finished breeding.",
            "diet": "Killer whales are carnivores, but exactly what they eat is determined by where they reside and what type of orca they are. Resident killer whales off the coast of British Columbia have a food source of fish, predominantly salmon, while transient whales in the same area will eat marine mammals and squid.Orcas also munch on cephalopods, seabirds and sea turtles, and have been known to eat dolphins, young humpback whales, blue whales, sperm whales, dugongs, seals and Australian sea lions. They eat around 30 different species of fish, which can include sharks and rays, too.Orcas have no natural predators and often hunt in groups like wolf packs. They spend most of their time in shallow waters, but will dive deeper if they are chasing prey. When hunting a large mammal such as a blue whale, as many as 50 killer whales will join the hunt to successfully kill the large whale. Orcas will also prey on the calves of whales and will concentrate on the weak or young.A killer whale eats around 227 kilograms (500\u00a0lb) each day, on average. They either feed using a method called carousel feeding when catching fish, or disable larger prey like mammals by drowning them or slapping, ramming or landing on them to avoid injury and a fight. They are also known to chase whales to exhaustion before feeding on them.BehaviorKiller whales are very social animals, and live in social groups called pods. Pods usually consist of between a few and up to 20 orcas, but they can be much bigger, too, particularly if they are mating or trying to catch prey.Unlike any other known mammal social structure, resident orcas live with their mothers for their entire lives. Often, there are special mods called matrilines that are made up of a the eldest female (matriarch) and her sons and daughters, and the descendants of her daughters, which can mean that as many as four generations travel and live together. Closely related matrilines will then form a larger pod together. Transient pods are smaller than resident pods, typically consisting of an adult female and one or two of her offspring.",
            "day to day life": "The average day to day life of an orca consists of foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Orcas frequently engage in spy hopping, breaching (jumping completely out of the water) and tail-slapping, which could be down to mating, communicating or simply just playing. Spy hopping behavior consist of the orca holding itself vertically in the water and kicking with its tail fluke in order to hold its head above the water line.These animals also swim alongside porpoises and dolphins and can travel up to 40 miles a day on average.",
            "communication": "Because orcas are social animals, they communicate a lot. They rely on underwater sounds to understand where each other are, for navigation and also to locate food. Members of the same pod communicate with each other through clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls, and each pod has a unique set of calls that are learned and culturally transmitted among individuals. These are known as dialects.",
            "breeding": "Females reach sexual maturity at about ten years old. They then have periods of polyestrous cycling (recurring physiologic changes that are induced by reproductive hormones) with non-cycling periods of between three and sixteen months. They reach peak fertility around 20, while males reach maturity at around 15, but do not typically reproduce until age 21. Female orcas can breed until the age of 40, after which they experience a rapid decrease in fertility.The gestation period of an orca varies between 15 to 18 months. Male orcas mate with females from other pods, which prevents inbreeding, and females usually produce one calve in a single pregnancy, about every five years. There is no distinct calving season, so birth can take place in any month.Unfortunately, mortality is extremely high during the first seven months of an orca\u2019s life, when 37\u201350% of all calves die. Orca killer whale Calves nurse exclusively for at least a year, but remain in close association with their mother for the first two years.Females give birth to an average of 5 calves over a period of 25 years, and then, when they no longer have calves, they play an important role in the family group \u2013 \u201cbabysitting\u201d the calves of other females.\u00a0 Calves nurse for up to two years, but will start to take solid food at about twelve months. All resident Orca pod members, including males of all ages, participate in the care of young whales.Typically, females live to the age of fifty, but may survive well into their eighties or nineties in exceptional cases. Males live to about 45 on average and up to 90 in exceptional cases. The lifespans of captive Orcas are significantly shorter, usually less than 25 years.",
            "migration": "Migration patterns in orcas are poorly understood, but they are known to make seasonal movements.",
            "intelligence": "Galapagos killer whales are considered to be very intelligent animals and have the second-heaviest brains among marine mammals. In captivity they can be trained and know how to teach skills to their young. They are also known to imitate others.Human RelationshipOrcas\u2019 relationship with humans is a topic that has been discussed in great detail, particularly when it comes to captive orcas. Despite their name, in the wild, there are very few confirmed attacks on humans, and any that have occurred have not resulted in fatalities. There have been reports of wild orcas attacking boats, but it is thought that the behaviour is playful, rather than aggressive.However, in captivity, orca attacks have been the cause of fatalities, particularly in orca trainers. The whales\u2019 enormous size, color and ability train has made them a popular attraction at aquaria and aquatic theme parks, with many orcas being taken from the wild. Orcas are also bred in captivity and, by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.While it often appears that orcas have a good relationship with trainers in captivity, critics say that the intelligence and large size of the animals means they do not suit life in captivity. Captive orcas also occasionally act aggressively towards themselves, their tankmates, or humans, which critics say is a result of stress. This has been shown in the critically acclaimed 2013 film Blackfish, which focused on the bull orca Tilikum who lived at SeaWorld Orlando until his death in 2017. The public\u2019s growing appreciation of orcas has led to growing opposition to whale\u2013keeping in aquariums.\u00a0",
            "habitat": "Orcas are found in all oceans and most seas. They are mostly found in colder regions, such as Antarctica, Norway, and Alaska, where their large prey species are more abundant, but can also be found in temperate and tropical areas as well. Killer whales are most studied in the eastern North Pacific Ocean.Of the three main types of killer whales, offshore orcas have the largest range, but are often found in the same areas as transient and resident orcas. Transient orcas are found most often in the waters surrounding Alaska\u2019s Aleutian Islands and down to Southern California, and also along the coast of eastern Russia. Resident orcas inhabit the inland waters of Washington and British Columbia.The world population of orcas is uncertain, but experts estimate that there are roughly 25,000 in the Antarctic, 8,500 in the tropical Pacific, 2,250\u20132,700 off the cooler northeast Pacific and 500\u20131,500 off Norway.\u00a0Conservation StatusIn 2008, the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) changed its assessment of the killer whale\u2019s conservation status from conservation dependent to data deficient, recognizing that one or more killer whale types may actually be a separate, endangered species. In recent decades, several populations of killer whales have declined and some have become endangered.There are two distinct populations specifically protected under federal law: the southern resident population that ranges from central California to southeast Asia (considered endangered by the Endangered Species Act), and the AT1 Transient subgroup in the eastern North Pacific. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the AT1 transient population has been reduced to just seven orcas, while the southern resident population is about 76.Based on surveys conducted in 2006, the worldwide killer whale population is about 50,000 individuals left in the wild.\u00a0Predators Of The OrcaKiller whales are apex predators (predators that, as adults, are not normally preyed upon in the wild) at the top of the food chain and, while there are no natural predators of killer whales, whales are susceptible to humans induced threats. This includes fishermen shooting them due to feeling threatened in areas where they take their fish off their hooks, and the orcas being actively hunted for meat in coastal fisheries in Japan, Greenland, Indonesia, and the Caribbean islands. They can also become entangled in fishing nets.Further threats to orcas that are not directly attacking the animal includes overfishing, which results in loss of habitat and food for the killer whales. They can also be contaminated by oil spills, and can be disturbed by vessels and boats which interrupt their sound calls. This includes boats that take humans out whale watching.\u00a0The Orca As The PredatorThey are sometimes called the \u2018wolves of the sea\u2019 because they hunt in packs like wolves. On average, an Orca eats 227 kilograms (500 pounds) of food each day.Orcas prey on a diverse array of species. However, specific populations show a high degree of specialization on particular prey species. For example, some populations in the Norwegian and Greenland sea specialise in herring and follow that fishes migratory path to the Norwegian coast each autumn. Other populations in the area prey on seals. In field observations of the resident whales of the northeast Pacific, salmon accounted for 96% of animals\u2019 diet, with 65% of the salmon being the large, fatty Chinook. They have been observed to swim through schools of the smaller salmon species without attacking any of them.Although resident Orcas have never been observed to eat other marine mammals, they are known to occasionally harass and kill porpoises and seals for no apparent reason.Fish-eating Orcas prey on 30 species of fish, particularly salmon (including Chinook and Coho), herring, and tuna, as well as basking sharks, oceanic whitetip sharks and smooth hammerheads. In New Zealand killer whales have been observed hunting stingrays as well. Cephalopods, such as octopuses and a wide range of squids and reptiles, such as sea turtles, are also targets.Pack MentalityGroups of Orcas attack even larger cetaceans such as Minke Whales, Grey Whales, and very occasionally Sperm Whales or Blue Whales. Orcas generally choose to attack whales which are young or weak. However, a group of five or more Orcas may attack healthy adult whales. Bull Sperm Whales are avoided, as they are large, powerful and aggressive enough to kill orcas.When hunting a young whale, a group of Orcas chases it and its mother until they are both worn out. Eventually the Orcas manage to separate the pair and surround the young whale, preventing it from returning to the surface to breathe. Whales are typically drowned in this manner. Pods of female Sperm Whales can sometimes protect themselves against a group of Orcas by forming a protective circle around their calves with their flukes facing outwards. This formation allows them to use their powerful flukes to repel the Orcas. Hunting large whales, however takes a lot of time, usually several hours. Orca cannibalism has also been reported.Other marine mammals prey species include most species of seal and sea lion. Walruses and Sea otters are taken less frequently and Polar bears are rarely taken.Fish-eating Orcas in the North Pacific have a complex but extremely stable system of social grouping. Unlike any other mammal species whose social structure is known, Resident Orcas of both genders live with their mothers for their entire lives. Therefore, Orca societies are based around matrilines consisting of a single female (the matriarch) and her descendants. The sons and daughters of the matriarch form part of the line, as do the sons and daughters of those daughters. The average size of a matriline is nine animals.Because females can live for up to ninety years, it is not uncommon for four or even five generations to travel together. These groups are highly stable. Individuals split off from their matrilineal group only for up to a few hours at a time, in order to mate or forage. No permanent casting-out of an individual from a matriline has ever been recorded.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "desc": "The minke whale, also known as lesser rorqual, is a complex species of baleen whale. There are two species of minke whale; the common minke whale (also known as the northern minke whale) (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and the Antarctic minke whale (or southern minke whale) (Balaenoptera bonaerensis). Sometimes, taxonomists further categorize the common minke whale into two or three subspecies; the North Atlantic minke whale, the North Pacific minke whale and dwarf minke whale. Minke whales are the smallest of all the rorquals in the baleen family, with only the pygmy right whale being smaller. They belong to the family Balaenopteridae and the order Artiodactyla. All minke whales are part of the rorquals, a family that includes the humpback whale, the fin whale, the Bryde\u2019s whale, the sei whale and the blue whale. It is one of the most abundant rorqual in the world, and their population status is considered stable throughout almost their entire range. Northern minke whales have a widespread distribution in the Northern Hemisphere and are found throughout the northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Southern minke whales are found close to the polar region in the Southern Hemisphere, and are frequently found in areas off of Australia (such as the Great Barrier Reef), South America, and South Africa.",
            "minke whale lifespan": "The minke whale has an average lifespan of around 50 years, however, in some cases they may live for up to 60 years",
            "diet": "Minke whales are primarily ichthyophagous (fish-eating) species, and will eat anchovies, dogfish, capelin, coal fish, cod, eels, herring, mackerel, salmon, sand lance, saury, and wolfish. However, they are opportunistic feeders and will also eat crustaceans, krill and plankton when available.Minke whales feed by side-lunging into schools of prey and gulping large amounts of water.",
            "behavior": "Minke whales are usually found individually or in small groups of 2 to three, but loose groupings of up to 400 animals have been seen in feeding areas closer to the poles.Minke whales are known to vocalize and create sounds that include clicks, grunts, pulse trains, ratchets, thumps, and recently discovered \u201cboings\u201d. These distinct vocalizations can vary depending on species and geographic area.These whales have interesting breathing patterns. On surfacing from a deep dive, the whale breathes 3 to 5 times at short intervals before \u2018deep-diving\u2019 again for 2 to 20 minutes. Unlike other rorqual species, they do not raise their flukes out of the water when they are diving. Deep dives are preceded by a pronounced arching of the back.Despite its large size, the minke whale can actually swim very fast. The maximum swimming speed of minkes has been estimated at 20 to 30 kilometres per hour. Minke whales are very tolerant and often approach vessels.",
            "migration": "Minke whales undertake seasonal migration and can travel very long distances. Both whale species follow routes to the poles during spring and towards the tropics during fall and winter, but the difference between the timings of the seasons prevents them from ever mixing.Immature whales are often more solitary and usually stay in lower latitudes during the summer months. Adult males will likely stay closer to the polar regions, whereas mature females will migrate farther into the higher latitudes.",
            "minke whale reproduction": "Mink whales become sexually mature at around 3 to 8 years of age. The timing of conception and birth varies between region. The gestation period for these whales is 10 months and babies measure 2.4 to 2.8 metres (7 feet 10 inches to 9 feet 2 inches) at birth. Calves are usually born every two years.

They feed most often in cooler waters at higher latitudes.Conservation StatusThe IUCN Red List labels the northern species as Least Concern and the southern as Near Threatened. The dwarf minke whale (B. acutorostrata subspecies) has no population estimate, and its conservation status is categorised as \u2018data deficient\u2019.",
            "predators and threats": "The most common predator of the minke whale is the killer whale (orca). However, there are other factors that threaten the minke whale population.Minke whales have been threatened by commercial whaling since the 1930s. They were originally overlooked because of their small size, but these whales began to be targeted by China, Iceland, Korea, Russia, and Taiwan. To this day, Greenland, Japan, and Norway still hunt minke whales. They are taken as both animal and human food, as well as for scientific research.Climate change is affecting whale populations as it has a direct effect on oceanographic conditions. As the conditions of the sea change, so does prey distribution could lead to changes in foraging behavior, nutritional stress, and diminished reproduction for minke whales. Temperature changes also affects the timing of environmental cues important for navigation and foraging in minke whales.Minke whales are injured or killed in vessel collisions, too, and they can become entangled in fishing gear.\u00a0\u00a0"

The population underwent an alarming decline of 65% in the 1980s, but is slowly recovering. It is therefore the rarest penguin species (a status which is often falsely attributed to the Yellow-eyed penguin).Population levels are influenced by the effects of the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, which reduces the availability of shoaling fish, leading to low reproduction or starvation. However, anthropogenic factors (e.g. oil pollution, fishing by-catch and competition) may be adding to the ongoing demise of this species.

The Galapagos Rail Bird is a small (15 centimetres) nearly flightless ground living bird. It has dark plumage, black overall with a greyer head and breast, and white spots on the back. It has a scarlet eye, a black bill, and short, nearly useless wings. They are very vocal with a wide range of calls. The Galapagos Rail Birds feed on invertebrates, mostly snails, isopods, dragonflies, bugs, ants, also taking berries and some seeds. They feed during the day, moving along the ground tossing leaves and investigating the leaf litter."

Cartilaginous fishes are jawed fish with paired fins, paired nostrils, scales, two-chambered hearts and skeletons made of cartilage rather than bone. They are divided into two subclasses: Elasmobranchii (sharks, rays and skates) and Holocephali (chimaera, sometimes called ghost sharks). Animals from this group have a brain weight relative to body size that comes close to that of mammals and is about ten times that of bony fishes.",
            "manta ray": "The Manta Ray or Giant Manta (Manta birostris), is the largest of the rays. Mantas have been given a variety of common names, including Atlantic manta, Pacific manta, devil ray and devilfish. Some just call all members of the family \u2018Myliobatidae\u2019, stingrays. The largest of these rays was known to measure 13 feet across its pectoral fins (or \u2018wings\u2019) and weighed in at 3,000 kilograms (6,600 pounds).With their large lobes, long mouths and long thin tails the Manta Rays swim amazingly graceful through the waters.Manta Rays are \u2018filter feeders\u2019 (animals that feed by straining suspended matter and food particles from water) and feed on plankton and fish larvae near to the surface of the water, making visual sightings from boats quite common. The food is filtered from the water passing through their gills as they swim. The small prey organisms are caught on flat horizontal plates of spongy tissue, that span the spaces between the manta\u2019s gill bars.In Galapagos, The Manta Rays can often be seen from the cliffs at South Plaza Island or even from the beach shore on Rabida Island.Manta Rays have a diamond shaped body which helps then swim gracefully through the water using their pectoral fins as \u2018wings\u2019.Manta Rays are most commonly black on the top of their bodies and white on their underparts, however, some have blue coloring on their backs. A giant mantas eyes are located at the base of the cephalic lobes on each side of the head.Unlike other rays, their mouth is found at the back edge of its head. To breathe, like other rays, the manta has five pairs of gills on the underside. The Manta rays mouth is big enough to fit 4 fully grown men in it at the same time.The Manta Ray has distinctive \u2018horns\u2019 from which the common name \u2018devil ray\u2019 stems. They are located on either side of its broad head. The unique structure of these horns is actually derived from the pectoral fins. During embryonic development, part of the pectoral fin breaks away and moves forward, surrounding the mouth. This gives the Manta ray the distinction of being the only jawed vertebrate to have novel limbs.Their horns are very flexible and are used to direct plankton, small fish and water into the Mantas very broad and wide mouth. The manta can curl them up to reduce drag while swimming.The Manta Ray is a prized sighting by enthusiastic divers. Mantas are extremely curious around humans and are fond of swimming with scuba divers. They will often surface to investigate boats (without engines running) and reportedly enjoy being stroked. They have the biggest brains of any fish. Mantas are known to breach (leap out of) the water into the air as they swim.The predators of the Manta ray include mainly large sharks, however in some cases orca/killer whales have also been observed preying on them.",
            "golden ray": "Golden Rays (Rhinoptera steindachneri, raya dorada) range in size, but they are usually between a half-metre to a metre across the wings. They are named for their golden-colored tops, but they can also be recognized by their blunt heads and long, whip-like tail.Golden Rays are often seen in the diving sites swimming alone, they also swim in large schools in quiet lagoons. The best place to see schools of golden rays is at Black Turtle Cove on Santa Cruz island.",
            "spotted eagle ray": "Spotted Eagle Rays (Aetobatus narinari) are also commonly sighted in large schools in small lagoons such as like Black Turtle Cove on Santa Cruz Island.Spotted Eagle Rays have pointed heads, long tails with a spiny termination and a wingspan ranging from one to two metres, but their most distinguishing feature is the array of white spots that covers their black tops. They are also occasionally seen snorkeling at Turtle Island or off the coast at Floreana Island.",
            "stingrays": "Stingrays (Dasyatididae, rayas) are common residents of shallow beach areas and deeper sandy bottoms throughout the Gal\u00e1pagos.They are grey in color with a flat body and long, narrow tail, which has the nasty stinger at its base. The size and shape of stingrays can vary very much. They can appear small and angular like the \u2018diamond stingray\u2019 to the larger (up to two metre wingspan), circular like the \u2018marbled\u2019 stingray.You can spot stingrays lurking on the sea floor of some shallower snorkel sites or hiding out in the surf at Punta Cormorant and/or Post Office Bay, Floreana Island.\u00a0\u00a0"

This particular one is from the Vespertilionidae family which is the largest family, and includes 35 genera and 318 species. The red bat belongs to the genus Lasiurus and the order Chiroptera. The red bat has been found around parts of South America. These bats are similar to birds. They migrate to the southern parts of the world when it gets cold and head north when the weather starts to warm up in northern hemispheres of the world. The bats will most likely be found in the forest roosting under leaves. They do this because they are either trying to eat or hide from predators. The bats hang upside down from a tree branch from one foot because they are trying to blend in with their surroundings, such as dead leaves.",
            "lifespan": "These bats have an average lifespan of around two years, although it is thought they could live longer.",
            "diet": "The red bat is insectivorous, and eats a variety of insects. They eat moths, flies, true bugs, beetles and cicadas. Insects may be caught in the wing or tail membrane during flight and eaten \u201con the wing.\u201d They attack flying insects every thirty seconds, on average. If a bat is stalking a moth using echolocation the moth can hear this and will try to flee the attack by diving.",
            "behavior": "Normally the red bat does not come out during the day, they are called nocturnal. Therefore, they come out during the night and hunt. However, it is not uncommon to see them flying early in the afternoon during summer and in daylight on warm winter days.They do not use their eyes to hunt, but use echolocation to locate prey. They use their voices to make echoes and the echoes help them make pictures in their minds about what is around. They forage along forest edges, and flyway corridors of streams and woods roads. They hunt within 500 m of a light source, and have been found in insect light traps. They can also be seen dipping and diving around streetlights.Red bats roost in the foliage of deciduous trees, often hanging by one foot, and look, superficially, like dead leaves. Red bats are solitary when roosting, but small groups of individuals often forage together.When red bats hibernate they choose hollow trees, usually 2 to 40 feet off the ground. They maintain body temperatures just above freezing and cannot withstand prolonged periods of below freezing temperatures. They may be visible hanging from branches or leaves but their coloration helps to camouflage them from predators.",
            "reproduction": "Red bats mate during August and September, often during flight, but embryo implantation is delayed until spring. Multiple males can sire a single litter, and the female red bat can have one to four pups at a time, which is many more than other bat species. The gestation period is about 90 days. Female bats have four nipples, which allows them to nourish multiple offspring at once.Newborn bats are hairless and weigh approximately 1.5 g. Before the bats are able to fly the mother can carry up to four pups at a time, too. It takes up to six weeks for the bats to fly by themselves and one to three years to mature.",
            "red bat location and habitat": "Red bats are widely distributed in forested regions in eastern North America and Bermuda, and occur from southern Canada through Central America and into Chile and Argentina. Red bats are one of the most common bats in the state of Alabama. They migrate to warmer regions during winter. Unlike the closely related hoary bat, males and females have the same geographic range throughout the year.They prefer elm, box elder, wild plum, willow, hawthorn, sumac, and a variety of other woody plants for roosting, and hibernate in woodpecker holes, tree foliage, and under loose bark. They tend to choose habitats that are sparsely to moderately populated by humans and are rare in heavily urbanized areas.",
            "red bat migration": "Red bats are migratory, arriving in the northern climates in mid-April and leaving in late October. Male and female red bats have different migrating routines. Female bats are usually found in warmer climates during the month of June. Males are mostly found in the Appalachian Highlands. Due to the difference in migrating patterns, it makes it difficult for them to breed because they are constantly quite far apart.Red Bat Conservation StatusRed bats are not considered threatened and are listed by the IUCN Red List as Least Concern.The biggest threats to these bats are humans. Eastern red bats, just like other tree bats, are killed by flying into cars, tall human-made structures, or wind turbines.Some people view red bats, along with all other bats, as vermin, although they rarely invade homes. They play an important role in the ecosystem by eating insects.They bats can also carry many harmful viruses, disease and even rabies. These could be fatal to the human health. For humans, be aware of any abnormal behaviours a bat might have. When they are on the ground and can not move, do not touch them or try to help them. Red bats are liable to bite and cause infections. If a person comes into contact with one and is bitten, this person needs to seek medical attention as soon as possible.",

They are a cetacean in the genus Globicephala, which it shares with the long-finned pilot whale. Short-finned pilot whales are part of the oceanic dolphin family Delphinidae although their behaviour is closer to that of the larger whales. They belong to the order Artiodactyla. The name \u201cpilot whale\u201d originated with an early theory that pods were \u201cpiloted\u201d by a leader. Short-finned pilot whales are often confused with their relatives the long-finned pilot whales, however, there are various differences. Their flippers are shorter than those of the long-finned pilot whale, with a gentler curve on the edge. They have fewer teeth than long-finned pilot whales, with 14 to 18 on each jaw. The short finned pilot whale has a worldwide distribution, with a global population of about 700,000. There may be 3 or 4 distinct populations \u2014 two in the Pacific, and one in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Despite the fact that it is still whaled today, it is a protected species.

            "short-finned pilot whale diet": "Short-finned pilot whales feed mainly on fish, such as mackerel, hake, herring and cod, and also squid and octopus. They have very few teeth so they are adapted for sucking rather than grasping their prey.Short-finned pilot whales mostly feed at night in deep water using echolocation to find prey. They have been recorded swimming very quickly at depths, sprinting after large squid and have been aptly nicknamed \u2018cheetahs of the deep sea\u2019. They can dive to depths up to 1000m for 10 to 16 minutes at a time to catch their prey.",
            "short finned pilot whale behavior": "Short finned pilot whales are very sociable animals and for this reason they are rarely seen alone and are found in resident populations of groups of 10 to 30, though some pods are as large as 60. These pods are extended family pods which are tight-knit and stable, and the males and females within each pod are related to one another and mating takes place outside the pod. They are long-lived whales, with females living longer than males and even going through menopause. Once older females stop having babies themselves, they help other mothers in their pod care for their babies.Pilot whales are strongly bonded to each other and do everything together; resting, hunting, socialising, playing and travelling as a unified pod. The pods also form hierarchical associations that remain stable for generations, and are primarily thought to be matrilineal, i.e. lead by an elder female relative, similar to those of resident killer whales.These whales are known to be very playful, engaging in playful behaviour at the surface, such as lobtailing (slapping their flukes on the water surface) and spy-hopping (poking their heads above the surface). Sometimes they may float motionless at the surface. They are also sometimes seen logging and will allow boats to get quite close.Short-finned pilot whales are often seen in the company of common and bottle nose dolphins. They can also be approached by humans and will even allow humans to swim next to them.When hunting, the pilot whale\u2019s tail fluke rises out of the water before a deep dive. When coming to the surface to breath, adults tend to show only the top of their head, whereas calves will throw their entire head out of the water. Adults occasionally porpoise (lift most of the body out of the water) when swimming particularly quickly. Short-finned pilot whales rarely breach.",
            "short finned pilot whale reproduction": "Female short-finned pilot whales mature at about 7 to 12 years of age and give birth every 5 to 8 years. They average around 4 to 5 calves in a lifetime and will usually stop reproducing at around 40 years old.The gestation period for a short-finned whale is around 15 months. Females will nurse her calves for at least 2 years. The last calf born to a mother may be nursed for as long as 15 years.When they are born short-finned pilot whales are about 1.4 \u2013 1.9 metres long. At birth, short-finned pilot whales weigh about 60 kilograms (135 pounds).Males are polygynous, meaning they will mate with multiple females at one time and throughout their lives. Females mature much earlier than males, and males don\u2019t reach sexual maturity until they are around 13 to 16 years old.",
            "short-finned pilot whale location and habitat": "Short-finned pilot whales are found globally in tropical and temperate oceans, including the Indian, Atlantic, and Pacific Oceans. They mostly prefer deeper waters where most squid live, but can be found at varying distances from shore. They are generally nomadic and follow the movements of their prey. However, resident pilot whales have been recorded in places such as Hawaii and California.The short and long finned pilot whales have limited overlap worldwide; long-finned pilot whales are found in cooler temperate waters, while the distribution of short-finned pilot whales is largely tropical and subtropical.Short-Finned Pilot Whale Conservation StatusIt is thought that the population of the short-finned whale is at around 700,000 individuals, although it could be a lot more than this, as large parts of the species\u2019 range have not been surveyed.The short finned pilot whale was listed on the IUCN Red List as Data Deficient in 2008, and remains data-poor in much of its range, especially in the Southern Hemisphere and in large parts of the tropical and warm temperate North Atlantic Ocean. However, it is not thought that these whales are particularly threatened or endangered.In the United States, short-finned pilot whales are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The main threats to these animals include hunting, captivity and climate change.Short finned pilot whales have been hunted for many centuries, particularly by Japanese whalers. Today, pilot whales are hunted in a few areas of Japan, mainly along the central Pacific coast, as well as the Lesser Antilles (e.g., St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia, Dominica, Martinique), where whales are commercially hunted and the meat is available for human consumption. Unfortunately, their strong social bonds and herding instincts make them prime candidates for so-called drive fisheries, where whales are herded towards shore by boats and then killed in shallow waters.They are also susceptible to entanglement with fishing gear. If they are entangled in this gear and unable to move, the whale may drag and swim with attached gear for long distances, which can cause harm or even death.Short finned pilot whales have been kept in captivity in various marine parks off southern California, Hawaii and Japan. Pilot whales have historically had low survival rates in captivity, with less than half surviving past 24 months.Climate change is likely to affect pilot whales at it will have a direct effect on prey distribution and abundance, breeding habits and navigation.",

Sperm Whales can regularly be seen in the Galapagos waters. The Sperm whale was named after the milky-white waxy substance called \u2018spermaceti\u2019 which is found in its head. The Sperm Whale has an enormous head and distinctive shape.  The Sperm Whale is exceptional for its very large head, particularly in males, which is typically one-third of the animals length. The Sperm Whales name \u2018macrocephalus\u2019 is derived from the Greek for \u2018big head\u2019.",
            "spermaceti": "One function of the spermaceti organs is a buoyancy or diving organ. Before diving, cold water is brought through the organ and the wax is solidified. The increase in specific density generates a down force (approx 40 kg equiv) and allows the whale effortless sinking. During the chase in deep levels (max 3,000m) the stored oxygen is consumed and excess heat melts the spermaceti. Now only hydrodynamic forces (by swimming) keep the whale down before effortlessly surfacing.Spermaceti was much sought after by 18th, 19th and 20th century whalers. The substance found a variety of commercial applications, such as watch oil, automatic transmission fluid, lubricant for photographic lenses and delicate high-altitude instruments, cosmetics, additives in motor oils, glycerine, rust-proofing compounds, detergent, chemical fibres, vitamins and 70 or more pharmaceutical compounds.",
            "more about the sperm whale": "Sperm Whales breathe air at the surface of the water through a single, s-shaped blowhole. The blowhole is located on the left side of the front of the head. They spout (breathe) 3\u20135 times per minute at rest, but the rate increases to 6\u20137 times per minute after a dive. The blow is a noisy, single stream that rises up to 15 metres (50 feet) above the surface of the water and points forward and to the left of the whale at a 45 degree angle.Whales, along with bottlenose whales and elephant seals, are the deepest diving mammals in the world.They are believed to be able to dive up to 3km (1.9 miles) in depth and 90 minutes in duration to the ocean floor. Between dives, the Sperm Whale will come up to the surface for breath and remain more or less still for eight to ten minutes before diving again.Sperm Whales feed on several species, in particular giant squid, octopuses and diverse fish like demersal rays, but the main part of their diet consists of medium sized squid. Almost all that is known about deep sea squid has been learned from specimens found in the stomachs of captured Sperm Whales.Sperm Whales are enormous feeders and eat around 3% of their body weight per day. The total annual consumption of prey by Sperm Whales worldwide is estimated to be about 100 million tons \u2013 a figure greater than the total consumption of marine animals by humans each year.The only predator that attacks Sperm Whales, besides human beings, is the Orca. Large, roving pods of Orcas frequently target groups of females with young, usually trying to separate the Sperm Whale calf and kill it. Often, the female Sperm Whales can repel these attacks by forming a circle with their calves in the centre and then violently thrashing their tail flukes, so that no Orca can intervene in the circle. If the Orca pod is extremely large, they may sometimes also kill adult females. Large bull Sperm Whales have no predators, as even Orcas could be killed by these aggressive, powerful creatures.The physiology of the Sperm Whale has several adaptations to cope with drastic changes in pressure when diving. The ribcage is flexible to allow lung collapse and the heart rate can decrease to preserve oxygen supplies. Myoglobin stores oxygen in muscle tissue. Blood can be directed towards the brain and other essential organs only, when oxygen levels deplete. The spermaceti organ may also play a role.Female Sperm Whales are extremely social animals. Females stay in groups of about a dozen individuals with their young. Males leave these \u2018nursery schools\u2019 at somewhere between 4 and 21 years of age and join a \u2018bachelor school\u2019 with other males of a similar age and size. As males grow older, they tend to disperse into smaller groups and the oldest males typically live solitary lives. Yet mature males have been stranded on beaches together, suggesting a degree of co-operation not yet fully understood.The Sperm Whale is among the most cosmopolitan species in the world and is found in all the oceans and the Mediterranean Sea. The species is relatively abundant from Arctic waters to the equator. Populations are more dense close to continental shelves and canyons, probably because of easier feeding. Sperm Whales are usually found in deep off-shore waters, but may be seen closer to shore in areas where the continental shelf is small.Sperm Whales are believed to have diverged from other toothed whales early in the evolution of the suborder \u2013 around twenty million years ago.The number of Sperm Whales throughout the world is unknown. Crude estimates, obtained by surveying small areas and extrapolating the result to all the world\u2019s oceans, range from 200,000 to 2,000,000 individuals. Although the Sperm Whale was hunted for several centuries for its meat, oil and spermaceti, the conservational outlook for Sperm Whales is brighter than that for many other whales. Although a small-scale coastal fishery still occurs in Indonesia, they are protected practically worldwide. Fishermen do not catch the deep-sea creatures that Sperm Whales eat and the deep sea is likely to be more resistant to pollution than surface layers.However, the recovery from the whaling years is a slow process, particularly in the South Pacific, where the toll on males of a breeding age was severe.\u00a0\u00a0"

It is the one of the most widespread of the curlews, breeding across much of subarctic North America, Europe and Asia as far south as Scotland. Whimbrel Birds are sighted on Espanola Island, Galapagos. This is a migratory species wintering on coasts in Africa, South America, south Asia into Australasia and southern North America. It is also a coastal bird during migration. The Whimbrel is fairly gregarious outside the breeding season. It breeds on Arctic Tundra. In migration, it can be found in a wide variety of habitats, including mudflats, sandy beaches, rocky coastlines, salt marshes and flooded agricultural fields.",
            "lifespan": "A whimbrel usually lives for around ten years. However, the oldest recorded whimbrel lived to the age of 24!",
            "diet": "The whimbrels diet includes insects, crustaceans and berries. They use their long bills to probe into mudflats or wet sand for invertebrates such as crabs, particularly mud crabs, crayfish, mole crabs, small fish, marine worms, sea cucumbers, sand shrimp, and small mollusks. The shape of the Whimbrel\u2019s bill matches the curve of the crab\u2019s burrow. Interestingly, a whimbrel will usually wash a crab before eating it to remove mud, and removes the largest claw first.On breeding grounds, whimbrels eat berries left over from the previous summer, and these same berries become a very important part of their diet before they migrate. Throughout the year whimbrels also eat spiders, grasshoppers, flies and beetles.Whimbrel birds maintain their feeding territories on wintering grounds and in migratory stopovers, and will defend if another whimbrel gets too close.Behavior of Whimbrel Birds",
            "mating": "Whimbrel birds are monogamous animals. The male performs dramatic flight displays over nesting territory, flying in large circles, alternately fluttering as high as 1,000 feet and gliding down, while giving whistling and bubbling song to attract females. Courting males also chase females on foot and in flight.Receptive females respond to the male by drooping their wings, cocking their tail, and leaning forward. Pairs may also perform alternating displays involving a raised tail and lowered breast. They maintain their bond with trilling calls during incubation duties, too.Whimbrel birds often return to the same area to nest with the same mate in successive seasons. They usually have a territory which they share with a few other pairs, which can vary in size from 12 acres to over 90 acres. They are very territorial animals but tolerate neighbors, as long as they don\u2019t cross into their area. Once the eggs are hatched, their territorial defense lessens.",
            "nesting": "In breeding season, whimbrel birds usually nest on raised sites and in an area protected from the wind, such as near a shrub. Their nests are simple bowls that are pressed into the ground, then lined with leaves, grass and moss and measure about 5.6 inches across and 1.5 inches deep. The female usually builds the nesting area.A whimbrel\u2019s incubation period is between 22-28 days and between three to five eggs are laid. The eggs are blue-green to brown in color and both parents will help incubate the eggs. The downy young leave the nest soon after hatching, around one to two hours, and feed themselves.Males use dramatic flight displays and songs to attract females for mating. Both parents are very protective of their young and will attack any humans that come too close. Males sing and display on and above nesting territories, often calling loudly when they spot predators or intruders. The female generally leaves the brood first, and the male stays with the young until they can fly, at around 4-6 weeks.",
            "habitat": "The preferred habitats of the these large shorebirds include tundra, salt marshes, prairies, shorelines, and mud flats, particularly when they are feeding. When not feeding, whimbrels also live in meadows, fields, dunes, and oyster beds, as well as mangrove trees.They are found to nest in much of Alaska and in arctic regions of Canada and Greenland, but migrate to the Atlantic Coast of North America. The whimbrel spends winters in Africa, southern coast of North America from California south through Mexico, the West Indies, South America, and south Asia.",
            "migration": "Adult whimbrels leave the nesting grounds in July and the young from the year leave around a month later. They are usually found inland during the migration period, although they spend their winters on the coast, as mentioned above. In March through May, they begin to travel northward again.Some of these migrating birds make a nonstop flight of 2,500 miles from southern Canada or New England to South America.Whimbrel birds both migrate and roost in flocks, often accompanied by smaller bird species. A group of sandpipers has many collective nouns, including a \u201cbind\u201d, \u201ccontradiction\u201d, \u201cfling\u201d, \u201chill\u201d, and \u201ctime-step\u201d of sandpipers.Conservation Status Of Whimbrel BirdsThere is actually little known about the whimbrel population, which is due to the fact that they nest in remote areas. However, it is thought that their global population is around 1.8 million, and the conservation concern is relatively low. They have a widespread range and can be found on the coasts of six continents in the winter.Throughout the early twentieth century, whimbrels were heavily hunted in North America for food. There was a ban put on hunting in North America which has helped with repopulation, but they are still hunted today in parts of South America and the Caribbean. Aside from hunting, a big threat to the whimbrel is the destruction of coastal wetland habitats and rising sea levels.\u00a0"

Gemsbok are distributed around deserts, scrublands and brushlands in South Western Africa. There are two types of Gemsbok, a northern and a southern variety. The only difference between them is that the northern variety have black fringes on their ears while the southern variety have longer horns and their ears are more rounded in shape. Southern gemsbok are more abundant than the northern gemsbok. Gemsbok have also been introduced in Mexico and the southwestern United States. ",

Gemsboks coats are a light brown/grey color with lighter patches to the bottom rear of their rump, and sandy grey flanks. A dark stripe extends from their chin and travels down to the bottom of their neck, over their shoulder joints and leg along their lower flanks and on each side of their rear legs. All four legs are black on their top half, with white below the knees and black patches on the shins.Gemsbok have a horse-like posture and gallop and have muscular necks and shoulders.

These horns can extend up to 33 inches in height. The tips of the horns are pointed and sharp and native Africans have used the tips for spear points. Gemsbok also have very distinctive tan, black and white facial markings which make them easily identifiable.Gemsbok are able to survive in even the harshest conditions thanks to an intricate network of blood vessels called carotid rete, situated in the nose which cool down the blood supplied to the brain. This happens because of the rapid inflow and outflow of air created by the gemsboks panting and therefore protects the gemsbok from deadly temperatures. At the same time, however, the gemsboks body temperature is allowed to rise \u2013 eliminating the need to perspire (sweat), and therefore preserving water.",

Gemsboks can be seen in herds of 10 or more individuals, however, when food is scarce, usually during the dry season, they break up into smaller groups.After the rain season, gemsboks usually gather into larger herds of up to 300 individuals. Herds are usually led by a territorial male who marks his territory with piles of dung pellets to warn off male intruders. If intruders do come on to the territory duel conflicts usually occur involving horn clashing and body bashing. As calves in the herd grow, they test each other in what looks like games, but in reality are tests of strength. As the hierarchy becomes established, the need to fight is reduced. Bachelor herds are rare.Gemsboks do not shy away from large animals of prey.

            "behaviour": "Gerenuks live in small groups, some made up of females and their young and other exclusively males. Solitary males tend to hold specific territories whereas female groups may wander over a range of 1 \u2013 2 square miles, roaming through several male territories.",
            "reproduction": "Because gerenuks are adaptable eaters, they can mate any time of the year and have no specific breeding season. Mating rituals involve the male approaching the female and repeatedly tapping her belly or flanks with his front leg. The male may also rub her with his pre orbital glands to deposit his scent before mating. Females reach sexual maturity at one year and males reach sexual maturity at 1.5 years. The gestation period is around 7 months after which a single calf is born.When the female is ready to give birth, she will leave the rest of the herd to hide in an isolated area. Calves weigh around 6.5 pounds at birth. The female licks her fawn clean and then she eats the afterbirth. During the first few weeks of the calfs life, it will remain hidden in the grass and be visited 2 \u2013 3 times a day by its mother to suckle her milk. After each visit, the mother will clean the fawn and eat the calfs waste in order to dispose of any scent that may lead predators to it.Females bleat very softly when communicating with their young. The life span of the gerenuk is around 8 years in the wild and 13 year in captivity.",
            "conservation status": "Gerenuks are classed as \u2018Conservation Dependent\u2019 by the IUCN. Habitat loss and fragmentation by humans are the biggest threats to gerenuk populations."

            "desc": "The Gharial (Gavialis Gangeticus) is one of two surviving members of the family Gavialidae, a long-established group of crocodile-like reptiles with long, narrow jaws. The Gharial (sometimes called the \u2018Indian gharial\u2019 or \u2018gavial\u2019) is the second-longest of all living crocodilians. Gharials are most adapted to the calmer areas in the deep fast moving rivers. The physical attributes of the gharial do not make it very suited for moving about on land. In fact the only reasons the gharial leaves the water is to either bask in the sun or to nest on the sandbanks of the rivers. ",
            "characteristics": "Gharials have elongated, narrow snouts that are similar only to its relative, the False gharial, (Tomistoma schlegelii). The snout shape varies with the age of the Gharial. The snout becomes progressively thinner the older the gharial gets. The bulbous growth on the tip of the males snout is called a \u2018ghara\u2019 (after the Indian word meaning \u2018pot\u2019), only present in mature individuals.The bulbous growth is used for various activities, it is used to generate an echoing \u2018hum\u2019 during vocalization, it acts as a visual lure for attracting females and it is also used to make bubbles which have been associated with the mating rituals of the species.Gharials elongated jaws are lined with many interlocking, razor-sharp teeth, an adaptation to the diet (predominantly fish in adults). Being one of the largest of all crocodilian species, approaching the size of the Saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) and the Nile crocodile in maximum size, the males reach at least 5 \u2013 6 metres in length. Reports of 7 metre gharials exist, but are unconfirmed.The leg muscular system of the gharial is not suited to enable the animal to raise the body off the ground (on land) in order to achieve the high-walk gait, being able only to push its body forward across the ground in a movement called \u2018body sliding\u2019.Although the gharial can do this with some speed when required, when in water, the gharial is the most nimble and quickest of all the crocodiles in the world. Their tail seems overdeveloped and is laterally flattened, more so than other crocodiles, this enables it to achieve the excellent water locomotive abilities.",
            "behaviour and diet": "The young gharials prey primarily on small invertebrates such as insects, larvae and also small frogs. The mature adults feed almost solely on fish. The gharials characteristic long narrow snouts have very little resistance to water allowing swiping motions to snap up fish in their mouths.The gharials numerous needle-like teeth are perfect for holding on to struggling, slippery fish. Although primarily fish eaters, some individuals have been known to scavenge dead animals. The gharial is not thought to be a man-eater. Despite its immense size, its jaws make it physically incapable of devouring any large mammal, including a human being.",
            "reproduction": "The gharials mating season is during November through to December and well into January. The nesting and laying of eggs takes place in the dry season of March, April and May. This is because during the dry season the rivers shrink slightly and the sandy river banks are available for nesting. Between 30 and 50 eggs are laid into the hole that the female has dug and then it is covered over carefully.After a gestation period of about 90 days, the juveniles emerge, although there is no record of the female assisting the juveniles into the water after they hatch (probably because their jaws are not suited for carrying the young due to the needle like teeth). However the mother does protect the young in the water for a few days until they learn to fend for themselves.",
            "life span": "The life span of the Gharial is not exactly known, however, it is thought to be around the same span as other reptiles being 50 \u2013 60 years in the wild.Although gharials are not man-eaters, they have been given this reputation for sometimes mostly because of myths:Gharials appear threatening to the average swimmer or fisherman since they have a similar appearance to Crocodiles.In many cases, human jewellery has been found in the bellies of dead gharials (this is most likely from scavenging human corpses which are floated down river in the Ganges, or scavenging cremated remains that have been dumped into the Ganges). The gharial also swallows jewellery, stones, sticks and the like to act as \u2018gastroliths\u2019 (hard objects that aid in digestion and buoyancy management).",
            "conservation": "In the 1970s the gharial came to the brink of extinction and even now remains on the severely endangered species list. The conservation efforts of the environmentalists in cooperation with several governments has led to some reduction in the threat of extinction. Some hope lies with the conservation and management programs in place as of 2004.Full protection was granted in the 1970s in the hope of reducing poaching losses, although these measures were slow to be implemented at first. Now there are 9 protected areas for gharials in India which are linked to both captive breeding and \u2018ranching\u2019 operations where eggs collected from the wild are raised in captivity (to reduce mortality due to natural predators) and then released back into the wild (the first being released in 1981)."

            "desc": "Anteaters belong to the order \u2018Pilosa\u2019 which also includes Sloths. The Giant Anteater is the largest of the Anteater species, hence its name. Other Anteater species include the Silky Anteater (Cyclopes didactylus) and the Collared Anteater (Tamandua tetradactyla). Giant Anteaters can be found in forests and savannas throughout Central and South America from Belize to Northern Argentina but are more common in the South. Anteaters are one of the more stranger-looking animals on our planet. The Giant Anteater can measure up to 2 metres (6.5 feet) in length from nose to tail and weigh 40 \u2013 100 pounds. The Giant Anteaters coat is colored greyish/brown with black and white diagonal markings on their shoulders. Their hair is course on the upper parts but long and shaggy on the under parts and tail.

Their heads are long and narrow with a small black snout on the end. Their eyes and ears are small and they have a very long sticky tongue.Giant Anteaters have four short, stout legs. Each foot consists of 5 digits with the 3 middle digits on their front paws being equipped with huge, sharp claws which are used for breaking open termite and ant nests. Because they have these long claws on their paws, the anteater has to walk on its knuckles with their claws folded underneath to protect them. Their claws are very strong and this strength is necessary as the termite and ant nests are mixed with soil and termite saliva which become extremely hard when baked in the sun.Anteaters have no teeth and after scooping out the insects with their long tongues, the anteater crushes them with pad-like growths inside their mouths before swallowing them. Although the Anteaters sight and hearing are not very well developed, they have a superb sense of smell. Giant Anteaters have a rather small brain in comparison to their body size although they have large skulls which can extend up to 18 inches in length.",
            "habitat": "The Giant Anteaters preferred habitats are grasslands, tropical forests, open woodlands and dry savannas.",
            "diet": "Giant Anteaters are specialist carnivorous predators of termites and ants. They detect anthills and termite mounds with their acute sense of smell. When they have located their prey, the anteater digs open the nest with its huge, sharp claws. The anteater then inserts its very long tongue into the nest and extracts the insects which are then placed in the digestive system.The anteater has huge salivary glands that produce large amounts of sticky saliva to the tongue which allows many ants, termites and their eggs to stick to it at one time. The tongues microscopic spine-like protrusions further aid the eating process. Its tongue can extend up to 2 feet in length and can be flicked in and out of the insects nest twice a second. As many as 30,000 \u2013 35,000 ants can be consumed in one day. Anteaters never completely destroy a nest. The insects can repair their damage quickly and the anteater is able to return to the nest to feed again. Anteaters are very careful to avoid the dangerous and aggressive Soldier Ants.",
            "behaviour": "Giant Anteaters are solitary animals. Only mothers and their young are generally seen together. Anteaters are wandering animals and tend not to stay in one spot although some males can have territories of one square mile (larger for females). Territories are marked with anal secretions. Occupying both rural and densely populated areas, the anteater is more nocturnal if residing in populated regions hunting for prey at night. In rural areas, anteaters will find a shelter for the night perhaps in a hollow tree or small ground depression after a days feeding.Anteaters are not very vocal animals, however, they will make a \u2018bellowing\u2019 sound if alarmed and infants will \u2018grunt\u2019 should they fall off their mothers backs.",
            "reproduction": "The gestation period for the female anteater is 6 months after which one infant will be born. Females give birth in a bipedal position (on hind legs) using her tail to support herself. Infants are born with their full fur and markings. The infant is fed from the females mammary glands for around 6 months and it will ride on its mothers back for up to a year even though it is capable of a small, slow gallop. The infant will remain with its mother for up to 2 years or until she becomes pregnant again.At this stage, the infant will depart from its mother to begin its own life and will reach sexual maturity (being able to breed) at between 2 \u2013 4 years. The life span of an Anteater in the wild is around 14 years and in captivity, around 26 years.",
            "conservation status": "The Giant Anteater is classed as \u2018Near Threatened\u2019 by the IUCN. As anteaters are placid creatures they are preyed upon by large cats such as Pumas and Jaguars. However, a cornered anteater will ride up on its hind legs, using its tail for support and use its long claws which are 4 inches long, to fight off the attacker. Anteaters are also hunted in South America for fur and food."

            "desc": "The giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus), also known as the Queensland grouper, brindle grouper or mottled-brown sea bass, is a species of fish from the subfamily Epinephelinae which is part of the family Serranidae. The family Serranidae also includes the anthias and sea basses. Giant groupers are the most widely distributed species of grouper in the world, and are found in the Indo-Pacific. They reside in shallow waters, at depths of 1 to 100 metres (3.3 to 328.1 ft). These fish eat a variety of other fishes, as well as small sharks and other marine animals. These fish are solitary animals and protogynous hermaphrodites. The giant grouper is listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List, but some other species, such as the Atlantic goliath grouper, are critically endangered, so we can assume the population of the giant grouper is declining. The biggest threats to these animals are overfishing and habitat loss.",
            "lifespan": "Giant groupers have a long lifespan, living for an average of 37 yeas. Some, however, can live for up to 100 years old.",
            "diet": "Giant groupers are carnivores and eat a wide variety of fishes, but will also eat small sharks, juvenile sea turtles, crustaceans and molluscs. Giant groupers eat their prey whole instead of chewing, using their very large mouths to create enough negative pressure to suck in whole fishes or large invertebrates.They are opportunistic ambush predators. These fish can swim at speeds of up to 78 mph (125 kmph) if they need to, but most of their prey is slow-moving.",
            "behavior": "The giant grouper is a solitary animal for most of its life. They are, however, curious animals and will approach divers. While they are not considered a threat to humans, divers are advised not to try to touch them or feed them.Giant groupers can communicate using their mouths by creating a deep rumble that travels through the water. This is done to communicate with other groupers, as well as to guard its own territory.",
            "reproduction": "Giant groupers are, like other groupers, protogynous hermaphrodites. This means that they first function as females and later transform into males. They congregate in a spawning location with groups of around 100 fish, and the males release their sperm at the same time as the females release their eggs.They release their eggs and sperm into a water column that stands above a relatively deep reef, allowing the eggs to fertilize before descending deep into the reef so they are not threatened by predators. Neither male nor female groupers play a part in raising their young.\u00a0Giant Grouper Location and HabitatGiant groupers have wide distribution across the Indo-Pacific and are the most widely distributed species of grouper in the world. They can be found from the Red Sea and the eastern coasts of Africa as far south as Algoa Bay in South Africa and across the Indian Ocean into the Western Pacific Ocean as far east as the Pitcairn Islands and Hawaii. They can also be found as far north as southern Japan and as far south as Australia.These fish usually reside within reefs and are actually the largest known bony fish found on reefs. They can be found in caves and in wrecks, with adults holding and defending territories. They prefer shallow waters, at depths of 1 to 100 metres (3.3 to 328.1 ft).Giant Grouper Conservation StatusThe conservation status of the giant grouper is unknown, and they are listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List. However, other species of grouper, such as the Atlantic goliath grouper, are listed as Critically Endangered, and some species, such as the Red Grouper, are listed as Near Threatened.Therefore, we can make assumptions that the giant grouper population may also be in decline. The main threats to the giant grouper are overfishing and habitat loss.The giant grouper is a highly valued food fish and is taken by both commercial and recreational fisheries. It is valued in Hong Kong as a live fish for the live reef food fish trade.",
            "predators": "Because the giant grouper is so large, it does not have many natural predators. Young groupers could be taken by large fish such as barracuda, king mackerel and moray eels, as well as other groupers.\u00a0Giant Grouper FAQsAre giant groupers really giant?Giant groupers aren\u2019t exactly giant, but they are huge! They\u2019re bigger than humans, and can measure up to 270 centimetres (110 in). That\u2019s over 9 feet long! They are also very heavy, weighing as much as 400 kilograms (880 lb).Where do giant groupers live?Giant groupers prefer the tropical shallow waters of the ocean, around rocks and reefs. They live quite close to the surface, between 1 to 100 metres (3.3 to 328.1 ft) deep.Can giant groupers harm humans?Giant groupers are not known to be aggressive animals. In fact, they they have been called \u201cgentle giants\u201d in the past. They are quite curious animals and will often swim up to divers. However, it is unknown how giant groupers may react when touched by humans, so it is advised that you do not touch or try to feed one. They are very big and could cause harm if they wanted to!\u00a0Other Grouper SpeciesThere are 159 species of grouper within the subfamily Epinephelidae. Here are some of the most common grouper species.Atlantic Goliath GrouperThe Atlantic goliath grouper (Epinephelus itajara), formerly known as the jewfish, is found in the Atlantic ocean, ranging from northeastern Florida, south throughout the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, and along South America to Brazil.This grouper is thought to be the largest species of grouper, with most measuring up to at least 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) and weighing up to 363 kilograms (800 pounds). It is brownish yellow to gray to greenish in color and has small black dots on the head, body and fins.The Atlantic goliath grouper is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. The main reasons for the decline in its population are overfishing and the exploitation of spawning aggregations.Red GrouperThe red grouper (Epinephelus morio) is found in the western Atlantic Ocean. They are around 50 centimetres (20 in) in length and have a weight of 23 kilograms (51 lb). The upper part of their body is dark reddish brown, and their underparts are paler pink. They have light splotches across their body.These fish actively excavate pits in the seafloor and do so throughout their life. They create exposed surfaces on which sessile organisms, such as sponges, soft corals and algae, actively settle.The red grouper is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Their main threats are overfishing and habitat loss.Black GrouperThe black grouper (Mycteroperca bonaci), also known as the black rockfish or marbled rockfish, is found in the western Atlantic Ocean from the northeastern United States to Brazil, around rocky bottoms and coral reefs at depths of 10 to 30 metres (33 to 98 ft).It is normally around 70 centimetres (28 in) in length and around 100 kilograms (220 lb) in weight. It is an olive gray color is marked with dark blotches and brassy hexagonal spots over the head and flanks. Its pectoral fins are sooty brown and fade to orange towards the margin.The black grouper is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. It is often fished for its meat, and is further threatened due to the fact it is a relatively slow breeder.Snowy GrouperThe snowy grouper (Hyporthodus niveatus) is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, at depths between 10 and 525 metres (33 and 1,722 ft) over rock substrates in offshore waters.It is around 60 centimetres (24 in) long and weighs around 30 kilograms (66 lb). It is dark brown with a black margin to the spiny part of the dorsal fin.The snowy grouper is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, largely due to overfishing. In the US, the snowy grouper is protected and may only be fished during certain months of the year. There is also an annual catch limit for this fish.Warsaw GrouperThe Warsaw grouper (Hyporthodus nigritus) is found in the Western Atlantic from Massachusetts to the Gulf of Mexico, Cuba, Trinidad, and south to Brazil. It is classified as a deep-water grouper, because it inhabits reefs on the continental shelf break in waters 180 to 1700 ft (55 to 525 m) deep.These fish can exceed 8 ft in length and have been known to weigh 350 pounds (160 kg). They are dark reddish-brown or brownish-gray to almost black in color dorsally, and dull reddish-gray ventrally.The Warsaw grouper is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List. It is threatened by fishing or by catch release mortality (due to pressure change).Gulf GrouperThe Gulf grouper (Mycteroperca jordani) is found in the eastern Pacific Ocean where it is endemic to Mexican waters from San Carlos, Baja California Sur south to Mazatl\u00e1n. It resides at depths between 5 to 30 metres (16 to 98 ft) but has been recorded as deep as 45 metres (148 ft) during the summer months.This grouper can reach up to 198 centimetres (78 in) in length and reach a weight of 91 kilograms (201 lb). They are usually dark brown or gray in color, although they have the ability to quickly change color and adopt a pattern resembling that of juveniles.The Gulf grouper is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. They are considered to be one of the most valuable groupers caught in the Gulf of California by commercial and recreational fisheries, and this has led to a decline in their population.Nassau GrouperThe Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus) is found in the western Atlantic Ocean and around the Caribbean Sea, from Bermuda, Florida, and the Bahamas in the north to the eastern coast of Venezuela. It resides from the shoreline to nearly 100 meters deep.This grouper is one of the largest fish to be found around coral reefs. It can grow over a meter in length and up to 25 kg in weight. The color of this grouper depends on how deep it lives. In shallow water (down to 60 ft), it is a tawny color, but specimens living in deeper waters are pinkish or red, or sometimes orange-red in color. They are also often covered in lighter stripes, darker spots and other patterns.The Nassau grouper is listed as Critical on the IUCN Red List. The current population is estimated to be more than 10,000 mature individuals, but is thought to be decreasing. The main reason for their decline is loss of habitat, particularly coral reefs, and overfishing and fishing during the breeding period.Dusky GrouperThe dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus), also known as the yellowbelly rock cod or yellowbelly grouper, is found in the Mediterranean Sea and North Africa coast. It also occurs in the south western Atlantic, around rocky reefs from surface waters down to 300 metres in depth.It can grow up to 150 cm in length, but is more commonly around 90 cm in length. Its head and upper body are colored dark reddish brown or grayish, and it has pale greenish yellow, silvery gray or whitish blotching on top.The dusky grouper is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. This is down to the fact it is a popular food fish and heavily caught across its range. It also grows slowly, which makes it vulnerable to over-exploitation.Blacktip GrouperThe blacktip grouper (Epinephelus fasciatus), also known as the redbanded grouper, blacktipped cod, black-tipped rockcod, footballer cod, red-barred cod, red-barred rockcod, scarlet rock-cod or weathered rock-cod, is found in the Indo-Pacific region, from 15 m up to 160 m. This grouper can be more sociable than other groupers, and is sometimes found in groups of 10 to 15 individuals.This grouper is around 22 centimetres (8.7 in) in length and has a weight of around 2 kg (4.4 lb). Its color ranges from pale greenish gray to pale reddish yellow, to scarlet.Unlike most species of grouper, the blacktip grouper is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.Coral GrouperThe coral grouper (Cephalopholis miniata), also known as the coral hind, coral rock cod, coral cod, coral trout, round-tailed trout or vermillion sea bass, is found in the Indo-Pacific. It resides at depths of 2 to 150 metres (6.6 to 492.1 ft), around coral reefs and often in caves and below ledges.This grouper is orange-red to reddish brown in color, and has many small bright blue spots that cover the head, body and the dorsal, anal and caudal fins. It can measure up to 50 centimetres (20 in) long.The coral grouper is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. It is an important species in commercial fisheries at the local level. It is also a popular public aquarium fish because of its bright colors.\u00a0"

The largest octopus species, it can be found along the coast of California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, Alaska, Russia, Japan, and Korean Peninsula, from the intertidal zone down to 2,000 m (6,600 ft). This octopus eats other marine animals, including crabs, fish, and shrimps, and, despite their large size, are preyed on by marine mammals, such as harbor seals, sea otters, and sperm whales. While the giant Pacific octopus is commercially fished in some areas, it is not thought to be endangered and is not considered at risk by the IUCN Red List, CITES, or the US Federal List of Endangered Species.",
            "lifespan": "The giant Pacific octopus has an average lifespan of between 4.5 to 5 years in the wild. This is a similar lifespan to those kept in captivity in aquariums. This is considered to be a fairly long lifespan for an octopus, as many go through a complete life cycle in one year, from egg to end of life.",
            "diet": "The giant Pacific octopus eats a variety of other marine animals, such as shrimp, crabs, scallop, abalone, cockles, snails, clams, lobsters, fish, and other octopuses. They catch food with their suckers and then bite the prey to kill it, often killing it with their toxic saliva. They will often stalk their prey and camouflage themselves in order to ambush it.These octopuses return to their den in order to consume their prey, and they deposit the prey\u2019s remains at the entrance of their den.",
            "behavior": "Giant Pacific octopuses are generally solitary animals that prefer to spend their time in dens, in which they will remain for weeks at a time. They will only leave to capture food, mate, or escape predation. A female octopus may live with young ones for some time after laying eggs but apart from this, these octopuses dwell on their own.These octopuses are considered extremely intelligent, partially do to their larger-than-average brain-to-body weight ratio. Individuals in captivity are known for having having unique temperaments and personalities, ranging from playful to destructive. The giant Pacific octopus is not an aggressive animal, and will rarely challenge humans unless provoked.The giant Pacific octopus can swim with a speed equal to or greater than 60 to 75 mph (96 to 120 kph).",
            "reproduction": "The giant Pacific octopus breeds throughout the year, though spawning peaks in winter. Males may breed with several females, but females mate only once in their lifetime. Males use a hectocotylized arm, a specialized tentacle used for the transfer of sperm, to insert the two spermatophores (each 1 m in length) into an oviduct located in the mantle of the female.After copulation, the female octopus lays 20,000 to 100,000 rice-shaped eggs in grape-like clusters of 200 to 300 eggs each, over several days. These clusters hang from the ceiling of the den like a fan. The female stays with these eggs and protects them from predators.Depending on the temperature, the eggs will hatch anywhere between 150 days to almost 1 year. This is due to the cold temperature delaying the development of the octopus embryos.Because the female octopuses remain with their eggs as they brood, guarding them and never leaving the nest, not even to feed, they die shortly after the birth of the babies. Males also die within three months of breeding.After hatching, the larvae are about the size of a grain of rice and very few survive. With limited swimming ability, they move to the surface to begin a planktonic existence that lasts 1 to 3 months. At the end of the planktonic stage, juveniles descend to the bottom levels of the sea where they undergo rapid growth: starting from 0.03 g and growing to 20 to 40 kg (44 to 88 lb) at adulthood, which is an increase of around 0.9% per dayGiant Pacific octopuses continue to grow until they reproduce.\u00a0Giant Pacific Octopus Location and HabitatThe giant Pacific octopus is, as its name suggests, found throughout the Pacific Ocean, especially the coastal North Pacific, along California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, Alaska, Russia and even into Asia, along Japan and the Korean Peninsula.They are generally found in tidal pools and up to depths of 110 m, but can also be found deep in the cooler areas of the ocean up to 1,500 m. They are best-adapted to living in cold, oxygen-rich water, between 7 and 9.5 degrees Celsius.These octopuses are benthic and live in dens or lairs, under boulders, and in rock crevices and prefer a soft substrate of mud, sand or gravel. They require a habitat where they can hide away from predators.Giant Pacific Octopus Conservation StatusThe giant Pacific octopus are not currently considered endangered, nor are they on the IUCN Red List. It is thought that the biggest threat to these animals in the future will be climate change.These animals are also haunted by humans for their meat, which could cause a decline in future years. The octopus (along with cuttlefish and squid) is a significant source of protein for human consumption. About 3.3 million tons are commercially fished, worth $6 billion annually.",
            "predators": "The giant Pacific octopus is preyed on by marine mammals, such as harbor seals, sea otters, and sperm whales. Despite this, adult giant Pacific octopuses are actually quite unlikely to be preyed on, although eggs and young are often eaten, especially when the mother is not around to protect them.Giant Pacific octopuses are known for their ability to release an ink cloud to protect themselves from predators, although they rarely do so. Instead, they tend to fight off predators with their arms. As giant Pacific octopuses escape, they then expel a cloud of ink as a screen, allowing them to seek safe refuge.\u00a0"

            "desc": "The Giant Panda (black-and-white cat-foot) (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), is a mammal classified in the bear family, Ursidae, native to central-western and southwestern China. Giant Pandas are one of the rarest mammals in the world. Pandas are easily recognized by their large, distinctive black patches around the eyes, over the ears and across their round body. Giant pandas live in a few mountain ranges in central China, in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. Pandas once lived in lowland areas, however, farming, forest clearing and other development now restrict giant pandas to the mountains. The mist shrouded mountain forests of China, have slowly disappeared over the last century. Many of the bamboo areas which are vital for the Pandas diet and survival are being cut down by people who then build farms there. The Giant Panda is an endangered species. According to the latest report, China has 239 giant pandas in captivity (128 of them in Wolong and 67 in Chengdu) and another 27 pandas living outside the country. It also estimated that around 1,590 pandas are living in the wild.",
            "giant panda behaviour": "Pandas are good at climbing trees and they can swim as well. Pandas are difficult to see out in the wild as they live among the thick dense bamboo plants in old-growth forests which is their favourite habitat. Pandas are very solitary creatures and will live alone and will only meet other pandas during mating season.Giant panda bears are silent creatures most of the time, however, they can bleat. Pandas do not roar like other bears, however, they do have 11 different calls, four of which are only used during mating.The Giant Panda is active at twilight and during the night. Throughout the day, it will make dens in caves, hollow trees and dense thickets. To avoid competition with other pandas over food and to signal its presence, the Panda will mark its territory by putting a pungent secretion from its anal glands on stones and tree trunks.The male Giant Pandas home range may overlap with several female territories and when breeding season arrives during the springtime, he will attempt to mate with these local females.The female Pandas usually announce their readiness to breed by becoming more vocal and leaving special scent marks around to enable the males to track them. The females give birth to their cubs in the Autumn and these stay as constant companions for the next 18 months or more.Pandas signify aggression by lowering their heads and staring at their opponents. To signal submissiveness, a panda will put its head between its front legs and often hide its eye-patches with its paws. This position is also adopted by females during mating, and by captive animals that are being harassed by humans. At close range, aggression is signaled by a swipe with a paw, or by a low-pitched growl or bark that will send an opponent scampering up the nearest tree.",
            "giant panda reproduction": "Giant Pandas have a very slow reproductive rate which sadly contributes towards their decline in numbers. Giant Pandas mate during the springtime. The female panda\u2019s gestation time varies between 112 days and 163 days. After this time, she will give birth to one single cub. On rare occasions, she will produce 2 \u2013 3 cubs, but usually only one will survive.The female panda can only conceive during a 72 hour estrus period which only happens during the spring breeding period.Because of this limited time for the female to become pregnant, some mating pairs will often copulate for several hours, whereas other mating pairs will only copulate once. Male pandas are more sexually active for longer and will attempt to mate with several female pandas during this time. The mating pairs will show no interest in each other at any other time of the year.The female panda gives birth in the Autumn. Panda cubs are very small, weighing between 3.5 and 6 ounces. They have little fur, are pinkish white in color, blind and very helpless. No other mammal gives birth to such a small baby except marsupials like the kangaroo who keeps her babies in her pouch until they are fully developed. A panda mother will carry her cub around in her arms and care for its every whim constantly. Panda cubs cry just like human babies when they need feeding or need care from their mother.They will cry for milk about every 2 hours or so. Between feeding times, the mother panda will continuously hold her cub very gently.This attentive behaviour will continue until the cub is able to move around by itself when the cub is about 3 months old. At this age, the cub will continue to follow its mother around and by 6 months the cub can begin eating bamboo. They are finally weaned off their mothers at around 9 months old. The weaning of the cubs in the spring following their births is an ideal time as the newest most protein-filled bamboo shoots are available.This gives cubs the best possible start in life on a diet that in the best of conditions is of poor nutritional quality. At about a year old, the cubs can weigh 75 pounds, which is about a third of an adult pandas weight.Female pandas do not reach sexual maturity until they are 5 to 6 years old. However, even young, inexperienced female pandas display a maternal instinct and know instantly how to care for the young without needing any practice. This is very important because no breeding season is then wasted through \u2018clumsy parenting\u2019. Because female pandas start to breed quite late and only rear a single young cub every 2 years, she will only rear in total around 7 offspring in her lifetime.By the age of 22, a female panda is considered \u2018old\u2019 and possibly \u2018post-reproductive\u2019. The giant pandas low reproductive rate makes it very difficult for a giant panda population to recover from a decline in numbers.With many conservation programs in place today, the Panda is desperately trying to be saved from extinction. It would be one of the greatest tragedies within the animal kingdom if this great bear was wiped out completely.",
            "giant panda conservation status": "Probably the most major threat to the survival of the Giant Panda Bear is the destruction of their natural habitats, along with increased human population and poaching. The different varieties of bamboo go through periodic die-offs as part of their renewal cycle. Without the ability to move to new areas which have not been affected, starvation and death will certainly occur for the giant panda. Such die-offs of the bamboo also put the giant pandas in more direct contact with farmers and poachers as the bears try to find new areas in which to feed.The recent announcement that the Chinese government will nearly double protected areas for giant pandas in the Qinling mountain range by creating five new panda reserves and five \u2018corridors\u2019 (linking protected regions) is expected to have a major benefit on the future of the panda. Many organizations are continuously supporting and trying to find ways to save and preserve the existence of this special, adorable bear."

The Giant Sable Antelope is a highly respected animal which may be one of the reasons it survived the long civil war in Angola. These antelopes are protected in nature parks where hunting is forbidden as they are critically endangered. Like its close relative, the Roan, the Sable has a conspicuous mane and this, combined with its horse-like build, have earned them the family name of \u2018Hippotragini\u2019, which means \u2018horse-goat\u2019. It is estimated that only 1000 Giant Sable Antelopes survive today.",

A females horns do not grow as large and only grow to around 142 centimetres. Horns are used as a effective defence against natural predators and in dominance fights.The female antelopes coat and young antelopes are a chestnut brown/rusty red in color. Giant Sable Antelopes have white underparts and white markings on their faces and on their rumps. These antelopes stand around 120 \u2013 140 centimetres at the shoulder and weigh between 200 and 270 kilograms. Males are slightly larger than females. They have a shaggy mane which extends from between their ears down their neck to their shoulder blades. Sables have long pointed ears around 6 \u2013 7 inches long and a tail measuring 15 \u2013 16 inches long ending in a tuft. They have thick, muscular necks and a compact, powerful body structure.",

            "diet": "Giant Sable Antelopes are herbivores and are specialized browsing animals that feed upon foliage, medium length grass, leaves and herbs particularly those that grow on termite mounds. Tree leaves make up 90% of their diet. They are diurnal animals meaning they are most active in the daylight but they are less active during the hottest part of the day. Sable Antelope have a ruminant digestive system.",
            "behaviour": "Giant Sable Antelopes live in herds of 10 \u2013 30 individuals, usually females and their young and headed by one male. Giant Sable Antelopes are timid animals like most other antelope species, however, they can become aggressive, particularly males who can become dangerous when approached or attacked. Male antelopes will engage on horn fights, clashing their long horns together while kneeling down on their front legs which enables them to avoid serious injuries making fatalities from these fights rare.Young Giant Sable Antelopes are preyed upon by hyenas and leopards and adults are threatened by lions. They will run for long distances at 35 miles per hour when being pursued.",
            "reproduction": "The Giant Sable Antelopes breeding season is seasonal and births coincide with the rainy season. After a gestation period of around 9 months, the female gives birth to a single young. A newborn calf is born with a sandy colored coat which helps it to camouflage. The calf will lie hidden away for at least 10 days while being nursed by its mother.Young antelopes are weaned at around 8 months and will become sexually mature at between 2 and 3 years. As the calf develops, its coat will darken and it will achieve its status within the herd. The life span of a Giant Sable Antelope is around 17 years.",

            "desc": "The giant squid (Architeuthis dux) is, as its name suggests, a very large squid that belongs to the family Architeuthidae and the genus Architeuthis. These squid can reach a size of 12 to 13 m (39 to 43 ft) and exhibits deep-sea gigantism, meaning they are extremely large for their surroundings. The giant squid is widespread and occurs in all the world\u2019s oceans. It is not known exactly how deep these squid live, but it is thought it could be up to 1,000 metres. They are similar in appearance to other squid, with eight arms and two longer tentacles. They are a source of prey for animals such as sperm whales, pilot whales, southern sleeper sharks and killer whales. The exact population of the giant squid is unknown, mainly because they live so deep. However, it is not thought that they are endangered, and are listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.",
            "lifespan": "The exact lifespan of the giant squid is unknown, but it is thought they live for less than 5 years. It is more likely they live for between one and five years.",
            "diet": "Giant squid prey on other, smaller squid species and fish. They catch their prey by using their two tentacles, gripping it with the serrated sucker rings on the ends. Then they bring it toward their beak, which can bite through just about anything the squid might capture. The squid must shred their food before they eat it, which they do with their radula (their tongue with small, file-like teeth).",
            "behavior": "Because the giant squid has never been observed in its habitat, it is difficult to know what its behavior is like. It is thought this species is most likely a solitary animal that hunts alone.",
            "reproduction": "These squid are thought to be a solitary species and scientists are unsure how males find females to breed. Again, as their reproductive habits have not been studied, it is difficult to know how they breed.Most likely, the males place their sperm onto the female squid\u2019s arms, and females may release eggs and hold them as they are fertilized in the water. The female then releases millions of fertilized eggs stuck together as an egg mass.When the baby squid hatch, they are just 1 to 4 millimeters long. They feed in the upper ocean at depths of about 650 feet (200 m), before moving deeper as they mature. The deeper they are in the water, the less likely they are to be preyed on.Squid grow very quickly, and they may reach sexual maturity in 6 to 8 months. Males reach sexual maturity at a smaller size than females.",
            "location and habitat": "The giant squid is found in all of the world\u2019s oceans. They are most commonly recorded in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, especially around Japan, Newfoundland, Norway, northern British Isles and the oceanic islands of the Azores and Madeira, and near South Africa and New Zealand.No one knows the exact habitat of the giant squid because they have not been observed there, but it is known they live in the deep sea and thought they might inhabit depths between 200 and 1,000 meters.Squid do not carry oxygen very well at higher temperatures and so will suffocate in warm water. Warm water will cause a giant squid to rise to the surface and not be able to get back down. Therefore, it is thought the giant squid are probably more likely to be found in cooler water.Giant Squid Conservation StatusThe giant squid is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List and are not thought to be endangered, but their exact number is unknown because they live so deep. However, the depth at which they live could be one of the reasons they are not considered threatened, because they are not as risk from humans and human-inflicted issues that many other sea creatures are subject to.",
            "predators": "They are preyed on by sperm whales, pilot whales, southern sleeper sharks and killer whales. Although they have a large size, they are light because their arms and tentacles account for much of their great length, which means they can be taken by these heavy sea mammals. Despite this, they do put up a fight, and sperm whales are often seen with sucker-shaped scars after hunting giant squid.Juvenile giant squid may fall prey to other large deep sea predators. However, as they grow, they tend to quickly outgrow any potential predators."

The giraffe is related to deer and cattle, however, it is placed in a separate family, the Giraffidae, consisting only of the giraffe and its closest relative, the okapi. The giraffes range extends from Chad to South Africa. Although the Okapi is much shorter than the giraffe, it also has a long neck and eats leaves and both animals have long tongues and skin-covered horns.",
            "habitat": "Giraffes can inhabit savannas, grasslands or open woodlands. Giraffes prefer areas enriched with acacia growth (a genus of shrubs and trees). Most giraffes live either in East Africa or in Angola and Zambia in southwestern Africa. Until the middle of the 20th century giraffes were also commonly found in West Africa, south of the Sahara. But populations there have fallen sharply and become increasingly fragmented.",
            "diet": "Giraffes live in habitats where the available food varies throughout the year. During the dry season, giraffes eat evergreen leaves, however, once the rainy season begins, they switch to new leaves and stems that sprout on deciduous trees. Also, twigs and branches are pulled into the mouth of the giraffe with their long and dextrous tongues. In the wild giraffes can eat up to 66 kilograms of food daily.When there is a choice, male and female giraffes feed in different ways. Males concentrate on leaves from the highest branches, while the females arch their necks to eat closer to the ground. Because of this characteristic behaviour, a giraffe can be identified as either male or female from a long distance away simply by its stance while eating.Male giraffes are also more inclined to wander into dense woodland, a habitat that females generally avoid.Giraffes drink large quantities of water and as a result, they can spend long periods of time in dry, arid areas. When searching for more food they will venture into areas with denser foliage. The giraffe has tough lips to ensure there is no damage to their mouths when chewing at trees and twigs such as thorns.Giraffes in captivity are generally fed on alfalfa hay and pellets, apples, carrots, bananas and browse (elm and alder are favourites).",
            "behaviour": "Female giraffes associate in groups of a dozen or so members, occasionally including a few younger males. Male giraffes tend to live in bachelor herds, with older males often leading solitary lives. A individual giraffe can join or leave the herd at any time and for no particular reason.Because giraffes are so widely scattered, it may seem that they do not keep in contact with each other, however, this is not true. A giraffes keen eyesight means they can keep an eye on their neighbours even at a distance.Female giraffes spend just over half a 24 hour day browsing, male giraffes spend less time doing this \u2013 about 43% of the time that the female does. Night is mostly spent lying down ruminating, especially in the hours after dark and before dawn.Male giraffes spend about 22% of the 24 hours walking, compared to 13% for female giraffes. The rest of the time male giraffes are searching for a female giraffe to mate with. Giraffe herds do not have a leader and individual giraffes show no particular preferences for others in the herd.Young giraffes are never left alone, however, they are looked after in a kind of nursery group where the females help look after each others calves (baby giraffes).Giraffes spend up to half their time feeding and most of the remainder is taken up either by searching for food or slowly digesting what they have eaten. Sometimes giraffes sleep during the daytime, often while standing.Giraffes normally lie down only at night, tucking their feet under the body and usually keeping the head upright. However, when a giraffe is sleeping, something it does only for just a few minutes at a time, it curves its neck around and rests its head on or near its behind.One of the most fascinating elements of giraffe behaviour is the duel between males fighting for mating partners. Giraffe duels are among the most extraordinary in the animal kingdom.Duels begin when two males approach each other and engage in rubbing and intertwining their necks. This behaviour is known as \u2018necking\u2019. It allows the opponents to assess each others size and strength.Often, necking alone is enough to establish dominance. If not, the rivals begin to exchange blows with their heads, using their short horns to tackle each other.Each giraffe braces its front legs and swings its head upward and over its shoulder. If a blow lands solidly, the giraffe may stagger under the impact and in rare cases may even collapse onto the ground. ",
            "reproduction": "The Giraffe breeding season can occur at any time during the year. However, births in the wild usually happen during the dry season and births in captivity can happen all year round. Giraffes reach sexual maturity in captivity at around 3 \u2013 4 years old, however, in the wild, males do not usually breed until they are 6 \u2013 7 years old. In contrast to the male breeding age, females must be physically larger to carry offspring.When male giraffes are ready to breed, they begin the ritual combat over mates. Giraffes are non- territorial and a successful male giraffe will mate with receptive female giraffes whenever and wherever it finds them.Gestation period is usually 13 \u2013 15 months and when a pregnant female giraffe is ready to give birth, she makes her way to a calving area that she will use throughout her life. The moment of birth is dramatic, with the mother giraffe standing on all fours and the calf tumbling onto the ground. Remarkably, the calf is rarely injured by its fall.Newborn giraffes are often on their feet within 20 minutes and are soon feeding on their mothers milk. Calves can walk about an hour after birth and can run within 24 hours of birth. Giraffe calves are about 2 metres (6 feet) tall at birth and weigh 104 \u2013 154 pounds.Giraffe calves grow about 3 centimetres tall each day during the first week and double their height in their first year.By the age of one year giraffe calves can measure 10 feet tall. Giraffe calves are weaned at one year and become fully independent by 15 months of age. Female giraffe calves are fully grown by age five and male giraffe calves by the age of seven.Young giraffes may suckle for up to a year, however, they start to sample plants just a few weeks after birth. Giraffe calves are ready to leave the protection of their mother after 15 \u2013 18 months of development.",
            "predators": "Adult giraffes generally have no predators other than lions and humans, as their huge hooves are very effective in defending against predators. Giraffes are more vulnerable when they are lying down or drinking, because this gives lions the opportunity to leap up and seize them by the nose or throat.Newly born calves are at much greater risk. Despite their mothers best efforts to protect them, over 50 percent of all giraffe newborns are killed by hyenas and big cats such as lions and leopards during the first month of their life. In captivity, giraffes have lived over the age of 30 years, however, their maximum life span in the wild is about 25 years.",
            "sounds": "Giraffes are usually silent although they can bellow, grunt or snort when alarmed, as when confronted by lions, and can also moo in distress.Hold your mouse over the giraffe photo and you may be able to hear a giraffe grunt. (ie only)Calves (young giraffes) bleat and make a mewing call, cows (female giraffes) seeking lost calves will bellow and courting bulls (male giraffes) may emit a raucous cough. Giraffes also give alarm snorts, whereby moaning, snoring, hissing and flute like sounds have been reported. Giraffes also give out a grunting sound that sounds like a pig.",
            "adaptations": "Giraffes have amazing adaptions that help them with their lifestyle in the wild. Because giraffes grow to a very tall height, it gives them access to a level of foliage beyond reach of all other large browsing animals all except possibly, the elephant.Along with their height, giraffes have an incredible array of adaptations. For example, their skin coloring provides excellent camouflage, as it has many different patches of variable size and color.Giraffes skin is very thick, so it provides ample protection and insulation. Also, the giraffe\u2019s long eyelids keep out ants and sense thorns on the branches of the trees from which they browse. The valves in veins of the neck control a huge rush of blood to the head when leaning over; this prevents unconsciousness.There is also a network of capillaries in the brain called the \u2018wonder-net\u2019. It acts rather like a shock absorber and is another part of the system that prevents unconsciousness. (Also see \u2018Giraffe Anatomy\u2018 for more facts about the giraffes neck).A giraffes tongue is over 18 inches (46 centimetres) long, and the roof of the mouth is grooved to easily strip leaves off branches. Since giraffes are extremely efficient at processing nutrients and liquids from food, they can survive without water for long periods of time. Giraffes ruminate day or night, with periods of sleep in between.Giraffes also rest with their eyes open, standing or lying for three to five minutes at a time. Throughout the night, a giraffe may deeply sleep for five to 10 minutes lying down, yet they rarely sleep more than 20 minutes total per day.Giraffe Conservation StatusLike many of Africa\u2019s large mammals, giraffes have declined in numbers and in range over the last century. At one time, herds of over 100 animals were common in savanna regions across the continent, however, today concentrations like these exist only in East Africa particularly Tanzania Serengeti National Park.The decline of giraffe populations has largely been due to hunting. In Africa, the giraffe is a traditional source of hide and hair and also of tough but nutritious meat.Hunting of giraffes has not yet had a catastrophic effect, as it has on some of Africa\u2019s big-game animals, but it is a cause for concern. The natural habitat of the giraffe is also being impacted more and more by human activities, reducing the animals range.The giraffe is currently a protected species throughout most of its range and is classed as conservation-dependent by the World Conservation Union (IUCN). The giraffes prospects for survival are good for those living in national parks and game reserves, but for animals living outside these areas the future is less secure.Giraffe FAQs",
            "how tall is a giraffe?": "The giraffe is the tallest living animal on land. Fully grown giraffes stand 4.3 to 5.7 m (14.1 to 18.7 ft) tall, with males taller than females. Despite its long neck and legs, the giraffe\u2019s body is relatively short.A giraffe\u2019s neck can be up to 2.4 m (7.9 ft) in length. It results from a disproportionate lengthening of the cervical vertebrae, not from the addition of more vertebrae. Each cervical vertebra is over 28 cm (11 in) long. The giraffe\u2019s elongation of the neck largely takes place after birth, because giraffe mothers would have a difficult time giving birth to young with the same neck proportions as adults.It has been suggested that competitive pressure from smaller browsers, like kudu, steenbok and impala, encouraged the elongation of the giraffe\u2019s neck, as it enabled giraffes to reach food that competitors could not. Giraffes can feed up to 4.5 m (15 ft) high.",
            "what sound does a giraffe make?": "Early biologists suggested giraffes were mute and unable to produce air flow of sufficient velocity to vibrate their vocal folds. However, they have been recorded communicating using snorts, sneezes, coughs, snores, hisses, bursts, moans, grunts, growls and flute-like sounds. During nighttime, giraffes appear to hum to each other above the infrasound range.During courtship, males emit loud coughs. Females also call their young by bellowing. Calves will emit snorts, bleats, mooing and mewing sounds.",
            "how long does a giraffe live?": "Giraffes have an unusually long lifespan compared to other ruminants, and can live to up to 38 years. Adult giraffes are not usually preyed on because of their size, eyesight and powerful kicks, however, lions can prey on smaller individuals and giraffes are a common food source for big cats. Adult females are a lot more likely to survive if the group in which they socialize is bigger.Giraffe calves are much more vulnerable than adults and are also preyed on by leopards, spotted hyenas and wild dogs. A quarter to a half of giraffe calves reach adulthood. Calves born during the dry season have higher survival rates.",
            "": "",
            "what do giraffes eat?": "Giraffes are herbivores and are known to eat up to 60 different species of plant. They most commonly eat from acacia trees but also browse for wild apricots, flowers, fruits and buds along with eating seeds and fresh grass just after the rains. When stressed, giraffes may chew the bark off branches.A giraffe eats around 34 kg (75 lb) of foliage daily. They mostly eat during the first and last hours of daytime. They get 70% of their moisture from their food so need to drink very little. In fact, they can survive for up to three weeks without drinking water.However, when they do come across clean water, they must splay their front legs (which are longer than the back) in order to get their head close enough to the ground to drink.Giraffe requires less food than many other herbivores because the foliage it eats has more concentrated nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive system. As a ruminant, giraffes first chew food, then swallow it for processing and then visibly passes the half-digested cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again.Their height helps them to reach branches and leaves that other animals cannot. Competition for food is thought to be the main reason why their necks are so long. They use their prehensile lips and flattened, grooved teeth are able to strip the leaves off the branches.",
            "how do giraffes sleep?": "Giraffes usually sleep lying down, although standing sleeps have been recorded, particularly in older individuals. In captivity, a giraffe sleeps intermittently around 4.6 hours per day, mostly at night, but in the wild they can sleep as little as 5 to 30 minutes in a 24 hour period. The most common amount of sleep for giraffes is between one and two hours.Giraffes also go through intermittent short \u201cdeep sleep\u201d phases. These are characterised by the giraffe bending its neck backwards and resting its head on the hip or thigh.",
            "where do giraffes live?": "Giraffes are native to Kenya, Cameroon, Chad, Niger, Uganda, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania, Angola, and South Africa. They were originally found in over 20 African nations but are now extinct in seven nations \u2013 Burkina Faso, Eritrea, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria and Senegal. Most giraffes live in East Africa, although some are found in the reserves of Southern Africa. The largest concentration of these animals are found in National Parks.The different subspecies of giraffe live in different countries in Africa, but certain species have declining populations in areas, mostly due to habitat loss and poaching. The Uganda giraffe historically lived in western Kenya, Uganda, and southern Sudan, but now survives in only a few small, isolated populations in Kenya and Uganda.The Nigerian giraffe is now found in just one area of Niger. The reticulated giraffe lives in Somalia, southern Ethiopia, and northern Kenya.Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands, where there are large amounts of foliage for them to feed on. Their coloring helps them to blend in with their surroundings, but they are so large that they are safer in numbers instead of trying to hide.Because giraffes feed on vegetation that is high in the trees but also too woody for the mouths of smaller herbivores, they are also able to remain in areas where domestic grazing has obliterated the plant species close to the ground.",
            "what is a group of giraffes called?": "A group of giraffes is called a tower! Giraffes are social animals and are usually found in groups, often called herds. The groups vary in size and composition, but can range in size from one to up to 66 individuals! Giraffe towers tend to be sex-segregated, although mixed-sex groups made of adult females and young males also occur.Females are more selective about who they associate with from the opposite sex, and many herds are made up of mothers and their young. As they get older, males become more solitary but may also associate in pairs or with female groups.",
            "how does a giraffe move?": "Giraffes have two ways of moving, a loping walk and a gallop. When they walk, the giraffes move both feet on one side of their body in unison, followed by both feet on the other side.When they run, giraffes move the front feet together, then the back feet, swinging the hind feet up and planting them in front of the forefeet. While running, the neck of a giraffe moves backward and forward to keep the animal balanced. Giraffes have a top speed of about 56 kilometres per hour (35 miles per hour), however, because its legs are so long a galloping giraffe does not appear to be going very fast.Giraffes are not great travelers, despite their long legs. Giraffes cannot walk over swampy ground because their hooves quickly sink and they very rarely wade across rivers. Giraffes on opposite banks of a river may never come into contact, unless the water levels drop.",
            "how does a giraffe bend down?": "For giraffes, bending down is a daily challenge. To reach ground level for example, when drinking a giraffe has to splay its front legs at an angle of almost 45 degrees.A giraffes circulatory system is also specially modified, because the high pressure needed to pump blood up to its head could cause brain damage when the head is lowered. To deal with this problem, giraffes have elastic blood vessels that relieve some of the excess pressure.Giraffes also have a series of valves in their neck veins that ensure that blood always flows from the head back towards the heart, even when this means going against gravity.When giraffes do bend down to drink at water holes, it is commonly done in pairs. This is so that one giraffe can drink, whilst the other keeps an eye open for predators."

            "desc": "Goats are amazing animals. Goats are tough and versatile and have more uses than you could ever imagine. Goats can survive and thrive just about anywhere. A goat is a hoofed mammal in the genus \u2018Capra\u2019. Most goats are referred to as \u2018domestic goats which are sub-species of the \u2018wild goat\u2019. Altogether there are nine species of goat in the world, however, the domestic goat is the most common. Goats are \u2018bovids\u2019 and are members of the family \u2018bovidae\u2018 and \u2018caprins\u2019 which are sub-species of the sub-family \u2018caprinae\u2019. ",
            "goat behaviour": "Goats are extremely curious and intelligent. Goats are easily house trained and you can teach them to pull carts and walk on leads. Goats are also known for escaping their pens. If you have unsecured fencing, be warned your goats will be inquisitive and test it out and soon you will know where the gaps are. Goats are very coordinated and can climb and hold their balance in the most awkward places. Goats are also widely known for their ability to climb trees, although the tree generally has to be at a slight angle.If goats are raised correctly and disciplined from an early age, they never develop any bad habits. Goats will butt each other, this is quite natural and normal as they develop an order of dominance in the herd. However if corrected from an early age they never butt humans or other animals.A goat that has been teased may butt people as part of their \u2018play\u2019, which may start as kids, when it is no problem. It can be a problem if this behaviour extends to adult age and size. Hence start correctly: if a small kid pushes against your legs, never push back.Goats make a bleating sound much like a sheep. All in all, goats make wonderful companions and pets. Goats are a pleasure to keep and give you many hours of fun watching them with their humorous ways. Goats all have very different personalities and different little habits which can be very interesting to observe.",
            "milk": "The average milk production of a dairy goat is 6 \u2013 8 pounds per day. However, a high yielding Doe can produce up to 16 pounds of milk per day. Milking machines are sometimes used to extract the milk from the goats, similar to those used on cows at a Dairy Cow Farm. However, some owners of small goat herds prefer to hand milk their goats, usually twice a day. Goats milk is considered to be very healthy in lots of ways. Goats milk is used to make many dairy items that are both tasty and healthy. These include: pasteurised and unpasteurised milks, cheese, yogurts, cream and butter.Many people tend to choose goats milk as an alternative from cows milk because goat milk casein and goat milk fat are more easy to digest than cow\u2019s milk. Goat milk is valued for use with the elderly, sick, babies, children and those with a cows milk allergy. It is also a preferred milk used to give to orphan foals, puppies and other animals.Fat globules are smaller in goats milk than in cows milk and therefore remain dispersed longer giving it a more digestible texture.Goats milk is higher in Vitamin A, Niacin, Choline and Inositol than cows milk, however, it is lower in Vitamin B6, B12, C and Carotenoids."

Silver Monkeys inhabit Rain forest, islands, steppes, mountains, and savanna, depending on species. Silver Monkeys are frugivorous and folivorous in nature, eating mainly fruits and leaves. In addition, they also eat small insects. Silver Monkeys generally have a narrow nose, a narrow septum, close-set nostrils directed forward or down, bony ear passages, two premolars in each half of each jaw and hard patches of bare skin (ischial callosities) on the buttocks. They also have cheek pouches.",
            "genus: cercopithecus \u2013 golden monkey": "The Golden Monkey (Cercopithecus kandti) is also known as the Sichuan Snub-nosed Monkey. The Golden Monkey is one of the most beautiful and rare animals in the world. Although it is said to be unique to China, it actually resides in the Albertines Rift in Africa. A great valley that runs north to south for some 5,000 kilometres, from northern Syria in Southwest Asia to central Mozambique in East Africa.Local people have long believed that Golden Monkey fur wards off rheumatism and in the past, only Manchurian officials were allowed to wear coats made of their pelts. Endemic to Albertines Rift, the Golden monkey is confined to the Virunga Volcanoes.It lives at the highest altitude (over 10,000 feet) of any primate, and is one of the most endangered animals on earth, with only 1,500 individuals living in the wild in fragmented populations. Golden monkeys live mainly in the trees, although Golden Monkeys also spend a great deal of time on the ground.The Golden monkey has a soft pelt, a round head, short ears and a tail as long as or longer than its body length. Golden Monkeys vary in length between 57 and 76 centimetres with a tail of up to 72 centimetres long.A pair of bright and beautiful eyes sparkles on its azure-blue face. It has a small snub-nose and a sarcoma at the corner of its mouth, which becomes bigger and harder with time. Its long tresses resemble shiny, gold wool.Golden monkeys live in very large groups of up to 600 individuals dividing into bands of 60 \u2013 70 individuals in the winter. Males and females make different calls, while it is known that members of the same group sing together. Grooming develops bonding between offspring and female adults.Golden Monkeys live in a harsh environment so they have adapted to a varied diet, ranging from tree leaves, pine and fir needles, bamboo shoots, buds, fruits, lichens, tree bark, insects, worms, small birds and their eggs.Female Golden Monkeys mature at about 4 \u2013 5 years and produce one offspring after around 7 \u2013 8 months gestation. Golden Monkeys have a life span similar to its relatives \u2013 20 \u2013 25 years.The Golden monkey is an endangered species and faces a range of ongoing threats and the persisting effects of past disturbances, including habitat loss, human predation and the biological vulnerability associated with having the entire species occur in eleven small, isolated populations. As is true for other forest dwelling monkeys, Golden monkeys fall prey to leopards. Other potential predators include snakes and birds of prey.",
            "genus: cercopithecus \u2013 blue monkey": "The Blue Monkey or Diademed Monkey (Cercopithecus mitis) is a species of guenon native to various parts of east, central and southern Africa, including the Congo River basin.The Blue Monkey is found in rain forests and montane bamboo forests, and lives largely in the forest canopy, coming to the ground infrequently. It is very dependent on humid, shady areas with plenty of water.Despite its name, the Blue Monkey is not noticeably blue. It has little hair on its face and this does sometimes give a blue appearance, however, it never has the vivid blue appearance of a mandrill, for example.The Blue Monkeys fur is short and mainly a grizzled brown color apart from the face (which is dark with a pale or yellowish patch on the forehead \u2013 the \u2018diadem\u2019 from which the species derives its common name) and the mantle, which varies between subspecies.Typical sizes are from 50 to 65 centimetres in length (not including the tail, which is almost as long as the rest of the animal), with females weighing a little over 4 kilograms and males up to 8 kilograms. Blue Monkeys are catarrhine \u2013 the nostrils are close together and they face downward. The nail on each digit is flattened and the thumb is opposable.The Blue Monkey eats mainly fruit and leaves, however, it will take some slower-moving invertebrates. The Blue Monkey has cheek pouches to carry food in while it forages.Blue monkeys are diurnal and arboreal. Blue monkeys live in groups that range from 10 to 40 individuals, containing only a single adult male. The Blue Monkey is often found in groups with other species of monkeys such as the Red-Tailed Monkey and various Red Colobus monkeys. This is probably for added protection against predators. The groups have a unimale social system.The alpha male receives all of the copulations from the troop females. He also guards the troop against other conspecific troops and males. Female Blue Monkeys tend to join in confrontations with other conspecific troops. When takeovers occur, the former alpha male is often ousted from the group.Female Blue Monkeys are the ones who initiate mating with the male. The female Blue monkey gives birth to a single offspring following a gestation period of 5 months. Breeding season occurs throughout the year. Infants are weaned at 6 months.Both male and female Blue monkeys reach sexual maturity at 3 years old. The young are relatively well developed at birth, with open eyes and the capability to grasp their mother and support their own weight. Females provide their young with milk for about 6 months.Maternal care does occur amongst the female troop members. Longevity for this species has not been reported, but if Blue monkeys are like other members of the genus Cercopithecus, the maximum life span is probably around 20 years.As a prey species, these monkeys probably have some impact on predator populations. In addition, they are likely to be important in seed dispersal because of their frugivory.Blue Monkeys are listed with the IUCNI as vulnerable and on the US Federal list as threatened. Survival threats to Blue monkeys include habitat destruction, such as the clearing of rain forests. Blue monkeys are also destroyed for eating cultivated crops or destroying exotic trees.As is true for other forest dwelling monkeys, Blue monkeys fall prey to leopards. Other potential predators include snakes and birds of prey."

The Golden eagle is the smaller of the two eagles, however, it has a much greater distribution across the British Isles, particularly in the Scottish highlands, due to the white tailed eagles recent re-introduction after the last bird was shot in 1917. The Isle of Mull in Scotland is a perfect place to observe these elegant birds of prey as well as a few pairs of white tailed sea eagles. Mulls vast valleys and soaring peaks provide channels through which the birds hunt and glide, making sightings a regular occurrence. There are around 450 breeding pairs resident in Scotland and they are still on the increase. There are six living subspecies of Golden Eagle that differ slightly in size and plumage. They can be found in different parts of the world.",
            "description": "The Golden eagle has a wing span of between 180 \u2013 220 centimetres and can weigh up to a hefty 5 kilograms.As with many Falconiformes, females are considerably larger than males, in the case of the Golden Eagle they weigh one-fourth to one-third again as much as male birds.Their plumage colors range from black-brown to dark brown, with a striking golden-buff crown and nape, which give the bird its name. Their upper wings also have an irregular lighter area.Young Golden eagles resemble adults, however, they have a duller more mottled appearance. Also they have a white-banded tail and a white patch at the carpal joint, that gradually disappear with every molt until full adult plumage is reached in the fifth year. Golden eagles have a square shaped tail and legs that are fully covered in feathers.Golden eagles are not very vocal but they will sometimes emit a barking call or a twee-o cry.",
            "habitats": "Golden eagles prefer mountainous, often treeless, habitats, although they require large trees or rock faces for nesting.",
            "diet": "The Golden Eagles beak is well suited to tear apart large prey.The Golden eagle eats a range of mammals such as rabbits, mice, marmots, hares, the odd injured or dead lamb or other similarly immobile larger prey, as well as other occasional animals and carrion (dead animal carcass). They will also eat foxes and young deer. During winter months when prey is scarce, Golden Eagles scavenge on carrion to supplement their diet.Sometimes when no carrion is available Golden eagles will hunt down owls, hawks, falcons and wolverines. Scotlands expanses of open ground provide perfect hunting territory for these birds, allowing for fast aerial approaches leaving the prey nowhere to run.Golden Eagles have very good eyesight and can spot prey from a long distance. Their talons are used for killing and carrying the prey, the beak is used only for eating.",
            "behaviour": "The Golden eagle is a majestic bird, often seen circling effortlessly for hours in summer thermals rising off the land.Some Golden eagles will often hunt in pairs, one bird will drive the prey towards a waiting partner. The size difference between males and females allows more unpaired birds to live off the land, helpful to maintain a sufficiently large population in this large and slowly-maturing bird.",
            "reproduction": "Golden eagles mate for life, staying within a very large territory every year, Often moving between different nests (Eyries) each year to bring up their young. They build several eyries within their territory and use them alternately for several years. These nests consist of heavy tree branches, upholstered with grass when in use. Old eyries may be 2 metres (6.6 feet) in diameter and 1 metre (3.3 feet) in height, as the eagles repair their nests whenever necessary and enlarge them during each use. If the eyrie is situated on a tree, supporting tree branches may break because of the weight of the nest.Female Golden eagles usually lay two black eggs in late winter or early spring. The adult Golden eagles start incubation immediately after the first egg is laid, the eggs hatch after 45 \u2013 50 days. Nine times out of ten only one chick survives to leave the nest, occasionally, good hunting years lead to both birds surviving. After another couple of months the young eagles are ready to leave the eyrie and take their first flights.Golden Eagles invest much time and effort in bringing up their young. Once able to hunt on their own, most Golden Eagles survive many years. These young eagles are often mistaken for buzzards because of their similar size and markings.The life span of the Golden Eagle is as much as 30 years although around 20 years is normal for a wild Golden Eagle.",
            "conservation status": "Available habitat and food are the main limiting factor nowadays. Collisions with power lines have become an increasingly significant cause of mortality since the early 20th century.

Their wingspan is around 70 centimetres and they weigh around 630 grams.Male Golden Pheasants can be easily identified by their bright coloring. They have a golden crest tipped with red which extends from the top of their heads, down their necks. They have bright red underparts, dark colored wings and a pale brown, long, barred tail. Their rumps are also golden, upper backs are green and they have bright yellow eyes with a small black pupil. Their face, throat and chin are a rust color and their wattles and orbital skin are yellow. Beak, legs and feet are also yellow.Female Golden Pheasants are less colorful and more duller than males.

The nearest population of Western Lowland Gorilla is some 250 kilometres away.Both loss of habitat and the increased popularity of bush meat have contributed heavily to the decline of the Cross River Gorilla. They are categorized as being Critically endangered by the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\u00a0",

There are no Bwindi Gorillas in captivity.Bwindi Gorillas are a sub-species of the Mountain Gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei)) found in the rainforests of the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest and comprises about half of the worlds endangered population of about 650 Mountain Gorillas.The nearby Virunga Volcanoes Conservation Area, inhabited by the remaining 300 Mountain Gorillas makes Bwindi the only forest in Africa in which these two great apes occur together.Bwindi gorillas diet is rather higher in fruit than that of the Virunga population and the Bwindi gorillas are more likely to climb trees to feed on foliage, fruits and epiphytes (a plant, such as a tropical orchid or a staghorn fern, that grows on another plant and depends on it for support but not food). In some months of the year, Bwindi gorilla diet is very similar to that of Bwindi chimpanzees.Bwindi gorillas are much more likely to build their nests in trees, nearly always in Echizogwa, a small understory tree, however, due to loggers and poachers, the gorillas are slowly dying out.All five sub-species of gorilla are very similar and have only minor differences in size, coloring and build.\u00a0",

Gorillas are large animals, very strong and contrary to belief, they are not aggressive animals but peace-loving, shy vegetarians.Gorillas are covered with brownish/black hair except for their fingers, palms, bottoms of feet and face.Gorillas have a very large head with a bulging forehead. They have a crest on top which is called the \u2018sagittal crest\u2019, and is larger on male gorillas than on female gorillas. Gorillas have tiny ears and small, dark-brown eyes.Gorillas have no tail. Adult gorillas have 32 teeth, with large molars (flat teeth used for chewing food) and large canines (pointy teeth used for biting), which are especially large in the male gorillas. Gorillas each have a unique nose print in the same way humans have unique fingerprints.Although gorillas are very much like humans, they do not use only their legs to walk on. Instead they walk in what is known as the \u2018knuckle-walk\u2019. By doing this, gorillas walk with both their long arms and legs.Gorillas roll their fingers into their hands like a sort of fist and apply pressure on the knuckles as they move along. Gorillas are very good at climbing trees with their long, flexible limbs, however, gorillas cannot swim.\u00a0",

            "gorilla diet": "Gorillas are predominantly herbivores, however, they are also classed as omnivores. As well as eating mostly plant material, they sometimes supplement their diets with ants and termites. Gorillas forage for food in the forests during the day.Gorillas eat leaves, fruit, seeds, tree bark, plant bulbs, tender plant shoots and flowers. They have been known to eat various parts of over 200 different plant species. Gorillas do not need to drink water as they get the moisture they need from the foliage that they eat.An average adult gorilla eats around 50 pounds of food a day. The gorillas large molars and long canines allow them to crush hard plants like bamboo. Lowland gorillas feed mainly on fruit while Mountain gorillas feed mostly on herbs, stems and roots.\u00a0",

Gorillas use at least 25 recognized vocalizations, including grunts, roars, growls, whines, chuckles, hooting, etc.Some gorilla gestures include chest-beating, high-pitched barks, lunging, throwing objects, staring, lip-tucking, sticking out the tongue, sideways running, slapping, rising to a two-legged stance and probably many more.\u00a0",
            "gorilla life span": "Like most animals in captivity, gorillas live a much longer life. Gorillas can reach a mature age of 50 years in captivity as opposed to only 35 years in the wild.This is mostly because they have to fend for themselves in the wild against the elements and human destruction whereas in captivity they are well looked after, cared for and fed and fussed on a regular basis.\u00a0",

Gorilla populations have decreased rapidly and their estimated individual population count is as follows:Western Lowland Gorilla 110,000 Eastern Lowland Gorilla 10,500 Mountain Gorilla 650 Cross River Gorilla 150 Bwindi Gorilla 350As you can see from the above numbers, the Cross River Gorilla is the most endangered . There are no Cross River, Bwindi or Mountain Gorillas in captivity which means they rely solely on their natural wild habitats.However, the main reason why these three sub-species have such small numbers and are gravely endangered is because of the destruction to their natural habitats caused by logging and agricultural expansion.The bushmeat trade, facilitated by logging has also become an immediate threat to the Western Lowland Gorillas, particularly in Cameroon."

Eggs are typically laid in late summer or fall and spiderlings emerge the following spring. However, in captivity, the eggs are kept at a constant temperature (without having to overwinter) and will hatch in about 4-6 weeks. A female that has mated with a male can produce more than one egg sac. For some\u00a0species,\u00a0 it\u2019s common to see two sacs at a time, side by side, attached to a surface (such as the underside of a rock, piece of wood in a wood pile, or in a rolled up leaf, for example). Each different species of\u00a0Agelenopsis\u00a0may create a slightly different egg sac, but typically each one contains anywhere from 50 to 200 individual eggs. The mother spider will remain near her eggs, dutifully guarding them, until she dies around the onset of winter."

In some species the males have bright colors on their wings that they use to attract females. A few species eat toxic plants, and keep the toxins in their bodies for protection. They are brightly colored to warn predators that they taste bad.Female grasshoppers are larger than the males and have sharp points at the end of their abdomen that are there to help them lay eggs underground. Male grasshoppers sometimes have special structures on their wings that they rub their hind legs on or rub together to make sounds.Grasshoppers can be found almost everywhere in the world, except for the colder regions near the North and South poles.",

They are large fish, and one of the largest barracudas. Resembling other species of barracuda, the great barracuda is elongated with a powerful jaw. The great barracuda belongs to the genus Sphyraena and the family Sphyraenidae. Sphyraena is the only member of Sphyraenidae, but there are 29 species of barracuda within the genus. These fish survive on a diet of other fish, cephalopods, and occasionally shrimp, using their maneuverability to hunt. They are generally solitary animals, although younger fish will congregate in shoals.",
            "lifespan": "The great barracuda has an average lifespan of around fourteen years.",
            "diet": "The great barracuda is a piscivore at all ages, preying on killifishes, herrings, sardines, gobies, silversides and anchovies as juveniles. As adults, they prey on larger fish species, like mackerel, or even dolphins.Their large gape allows them to feed on large fish by chopping them in half. They are voracious predators and hunt by ambush, using short bursts of energy that allows them to swim up to 27 mph (43 km/h) to chase prey. Their long and thin bodies allow them manoeuvre with ease through the water, but they are also known to sit-in-wait for prey to come close.",
            "behavior": "Great barracudas are generally solitary animals, especially at night. During the day, adults and juveniles can occasionally be seen traveling in schools, helping each other hunt for food and protecting each other from predators.These fish are known to be quite aggressive, and have been known to attack humans and inflict serious injury in the past. The majority of these attacks have been on divers, which may have been mistaken for predators. Barracudas may mistake objects that glint and shine for prey. Usually, a barracuda will only attack when provoked.",
            "reproduction": "Barracudas tend to spawn from April to October, and females can release about 5,000 to 30,000 eggs. These fish do not care for their eggs, and leave them to drift out into the ocean.Once the fish have spawned, they enter shallow waters with weedy areas on the margins of clear-water estuaries. When they are around 80 mm long, they move to the deeper waters of adjacent reed beds. At about 300 mm they will move to open waters and, when fully grown, they will move out of the estuaries completely.\u00a0Great Barracuda Location and HabitatThe great barracuda is found in nearly all warm seas, including the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic oceans. It is only absent from the Eastern Pacific. These fish generally reside in and around the edges of coral reefs, seagrasses, and mangroves, in water temperatures of between 74\u00b0F and 82\u00b0F. They predominantly live at or near the surface, although they are at times found at depths to 325 feet (100m).They will avoid brackish water unless they are getting ready to spawn, and post-larvae live on the margins and in the estuaries where they are protected. When they get large enough to protect themselves, they will move out into the open ocean and then to the margins of the coral reefs.Great Barracuda Conservation StatusThe great barracuda is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. These fish are a popular target for recreational fishing, largely due to the fight they put up when they are caught. They are also caught for their meat, although little of this meat is eaten in the United States.These fish are known for the pungent odor they release upon being caught. Their meat can also cause Ciguatera fish poisoning when eaten, which can be a serious illness.",
            "predators": "There are very few predators that are actually fast enough to catch the great barracuda. The main predators of these animals are sharks, tuna and goliath grouper.\u00a0Great Barracuda FAQsHow big are great barracudas?Great barracudas are fairly large, and can measure up to 100 cm (39 in) in length.Where do great barracudas live?Great barracudas live in and around the edges of coral reefs, seagrasses, and mangroves, in warm seas, such as the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. As young, they often live in estuaries until they are big enough to defend themselves in the sea.Are great barracudas dangerous to humans?These barracudas can be dangerous to humans, and attacks and even fatalities have been recorded. These attacks are usually on divers, who the barracuda mistakes for a predator and tries to attack. They often mistake objects that glint and shine for prey. However, great barracudas will rarely attack without being provoked.\u00a0Other Barracuda SpeciesThere are around 26 species of barracuda in the genus Sphyraena. Here are some species in further detail.Yellowtail BarracudaThe yellowtail barracuda (Sphyraena flavicauda) is found in Indo-West Pacific oceans. It is gray in color on the back with a countershaded pattern of a white underside. The tail is yellow with black margins. These fish can grow to 60 centimetres (24 in) in length.European BarracudaThe European barracuda (Sphyraena sphyraena), also known as the Mediterranean barracuda, is found in the Mediterranean basin and the warmer waters of the Atlantic Ocean. It has been found as far north as Cornwall in the United Kingdom.This barracuda usually reaches between 30 and 60 cm in length and can weigh at least 12 kg, making it the largest species of barracuda in the Mediterranean. It is dark above and silvery below.The European barracuda is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.Pacific BarracudaThe Pacific barracuda (Sphyraena argentea), also known as the California barracuda and silver barracuda, is found from Cabo San Lucas, Baja California to Washington.These fish can reach a length of about 1.2 metres (3.9 ft) and a weight of about 6.8 kilograms (15 lb). They are of a brownish-bluish color on their front sides and are distinct from other barracudas due to their silvery shiny backsides, small scales, and the lack of bars or spots on their body.Pacific barracuda are listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. They are considered a huge sporting fish in California and are considered safe to eat. However, there are restrictions in place on fishing this barracuda, which has helped to stabilize populations.Pickhandle BarracudaThe pickhandle barracuda (Sphyraena jello) is found in the Indo-West Pacific. It is silver in color with about 20 wavy bars on the sides of the body, which look like pickaxe handles and give the fish its name. It can grow up to 1.5 m in length.Blackfin BarracudaThe blackfin barracuda (Sphyraena qenie), also known as the Chevron barracuda, is found from the Red Sea and East Africa to the Indo and Western Pacific and as far as French Polynesia. It usually resides on coral reefs down to 50 m, in large schools.This barracuda can reach a maximum size of 140 cm and are known for their long black lateral bands that go around their body.Australian BarracudaThe Australian barracuda (Sphyraena novaehollandiae), also known as the arrow barracuda, Australian sea pike, sea pike, snook, or shortfin barracuda, is found along the south coast of Australia and along the east coast to Victoria and Tasmania. It prefers cooler inshore waters.This barracuda is greenish on its back, silvery on its flanks which fades to white on the belly and has a greenish-yellow tail. It reaches a maximum length of 1.1m and a weight of 5 kg. It is a popular fish with recreational anglers in Australia.Guachanche BarracudaThe Guachanche barracuda (Sphyraena guachancho) is found in the western and eastern Atlantic, at depths up to 100 m.

            "great white pelican diet": "Great White Pelicans feed mainly up on fish such as carp and cichlids but will also eat small invertebrates. These water birds do not have to dive to catch their prey, instead they use their large bills to scoop the fish into their mouths by dipping their heads into the water.Feeding is sometimes done cooperatively, whereby, several Pelicans will move into a circle to concentrate the fish and dip their heads into the water in unison to catch the fish. This makes for successful fishing. Each Pelican needs about 1.2 kilograms (2.6 pounds) of fish every day.On Lake Rukwa in Tanzania, there is the largest colony of Pelicans with over 80,000 birds and it needs 35 million kilograms of fish every year to satisfy their hunger.Pelicans are not restricted to fish and are often opportunistic foragers. Sometimes, they will eat chicks of other birds. Pelicans from the Dassen Island colony prey up on chicks weighing up to 2 kilograms from the Cape Gannet colony on Malgas Island. Great White Pelicans also eat crustaceans, tadpoles and even turtles. They readily accept handouts from humans, and a number of unusual items have been recorded in their diet. During periods when food is scarce, Pelicans also eat seagulls and ducklings and will also steal prey from other birds.",

Pelicans often travel in V-formation groups which is a spectacular sight.The Great White Pelican is well adapted for aquatic life. In water, the birds are just as graceful as when they are flying. They are fast, strong swimmers who can reach speeds of up to 6 kilometres per hour (3.7 miles per hour) as their strong legs and webbed feet propel them through the water in preparation for their sometimes awkward take-offs.Great White Pelicans are generally silent apart from when they are nesting during breeding season.",

The Great White Pelican is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.Pelicans are very vulnerable to pollution and because of overfishing in certain areas, they are forced to fly long distances just to find enough food.Great White Pelicans are exploited for many reasons. Their pouch is used to make tobacco bags, Their skin is turned into leather, the guano (faeces from sea birds, seals or bats) is used as fertiliser, and the fat of young pelicans is converted into oils for traditional medicine in Asia.

            "characteristics": "The Great White Shark is a huge, predatory fish that can measure 15 feet (4.6 metres) to more than 20 feet (6 metres) in length. It can weigh over 2,268 kilograms (5,000 pounds). Females are larger than males, as with most sharks.Great White Sharks are slate grey in color which helps them camouflage on the rocky sea floor while waiting to attack their prey. Their bellies are white and this is where they get their name from. Great White Sharks have a streamlined torpedo shape which enables them to be very powerful swimmers. Their large, strong, crescent-shaped tails help propel them speedily through the waters. Despite their enourmous size, these deadly sharks can swim at speeds of 15 miles per hour (24 kilometres per hour).The Great White Sharks body is equppied with 5 gill slits, an anal fin and 3 main fins but has no fin spines. The dorsal fin is located on it\u2019s back and 2 pectoral fins are located on its sides. When the shark is near the surface, the dorsal fin and part of the tail are visible above the water.Great White Sharks have huge mouths that are lined with serrated, razor sharp teeth that are triangular in shape. The teeth are arranged in rows. The first 2 rows are used for obtaining prey and the other rows rotate into place as they are needed. The teeth measure 3 inches (7.5 centimetres) in length. As teeth are lost, broken or worn down, they are simply replaced by new teeth. Great White Sharks are equipped with over 3,000 teeth at any one time.",
            "shark senses": "Great white sharks have large conical snouts with an excellent sense of smell with which they can easily detect prey. Shark nostrils are only used for smell and not for breathing, their gills are used for breathing. A shark relies completely on its sensory organs in all aspects of its life. One of the reasons sharks are extremely good predators is their amazing sensory ability. Their senses are remarkable like no other fish or mammal. Sharks rely on their complex sensory system in all aspects of their life, hunting, feeding, mating and general existence.Great White Sharks have the capability of detecting a single drop of blood in 25 gallons (100 Litres) of water and can sense even tiny amounts of blood in the water up to 3 miles (5 kilometres) away.Hearing \u2013 sharks have acute hearing and can hear prey from many miles away.Smell \u2013 sharks rely primarlily on their sense of smell for detecting prey.Lateral Line \u2013 this system is used to detect movement and vibration in the surrounding water.Eyesight \u2013 the shark has pitch black eyes that have reflecting layers called tapetum lucidum located behind the retina. Another modification found in some sharks is the presence of a nictitating membrane. This structure is a denticle covered membrane that protects the eye. It closes when the shark passes close to objects and also during biting or feeding.Ampullae of Lorenzini \u2013 these are small vesicles and pores that appear around the head of the shark and are visible to the naked eye. They are used to detect weak magnetic fields produced by other fishes, at least over short ranges. This enables the shark to locate prey that are buried in the sand or nearby movement.",
            "diet": "The Great White Shark is a ferocious carnivore who likes to strike it\u2019s prey from underneath, being able to completely leave the water and breach like a whale. Nothing is safe from this giant fish who blends in with the dark waters enabling it to approach unsuspecting prey. When an animal is sighted, the shark accelerates quickly to the surface and rams into their prey, simultaneously stunning it and taking a large bite. They then return to the waters to feed on the carcass.Great White Shark catching a sea lionGreat White Sharks feed up on a variety of marine animals including small toothed whales such as Belugas, seals, sea lions, sea turtles and carrion (dead animals floating in the water). A large meal can satisfy the great white shark for up to 2 months.Great White Sharks do not chew their food, instead, their razor sharp teeth rip prey into mouth-sized pieces which are swallowed whole.",
            "habitat": "Great white sharks are found in all major oceans and coastlines around the world, particularly cool and temperate coastal waters.",
            "behaviour": "Great white sharks are usually solitary animals but are usually observed travelling in pairs.The great white shark swims in a stiff-bodied, tuna-like position, unlike the sinuous whole-bodied swimming stroke of most sharks.Learn more about Shark Behaviour",
            "reproduction": "Great White Sharks reach sexual maturity at around 15 years old. When the sharks are born, usually along with a dozen siblings, they immediately become independant and swim away from their mother who may see them as prey and eat them.Newly born sharks (pups) are not at all small and can measure around 5 feet (1.5 metres) in length already. As they grow, they will at least triple in size. Shark pups generally feed up on fish, rays and other sharks.The life span of the Great White Shark is around 30 years or more.",
            "and humans": "Even though great white sharks have been recorded to attack humans, we are not actually on their menu. It is thought the these sharks are just curious and sample bite before releasing their victim. Most great white shark attacks are not fatal. Great white Sharks account for about half to a third of all 100 annual reported shark attacks. Of these 30 \u2013 50 attacks, around 10 \u2013 15 are fatal.",
            "conservation status": "The Great White Shark is an Endangered Species but is classed as \u2018Vulnerable\u2019 by the IUCN. Threats to these massive sea creatures include overfishing and accidental catching in gill nets. Numbers are decreasing because of these factors."

            "desc": "Out of the six species of flamingo on our planet, the Greater Flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus) is the most common and widespread member of the flamingo family. The Greater Flamingo is an easily identifiable, colorful wading bird and is often found flocking together with the Lesser Flamingo in the great salt lakes across Africa. These famous pink birds can be found in warm, watery regions on many continents and also occur in Asia in the coastal regions of India and Pakistan, Central America, South America, the Caribbean and in Southern Europe.",
            "characteristics": "The Greater Flamingo is the largest species of flamingo and stands around 1.5 metres (5 feet) tall in height and weighs between 2 \u2013 4 kilograms (4.4 \u2013 8.8 pounds). The Greater Flamingo has a wingspan of between 1.4 and 1.7 metres (4.5 \u2013 5.5 feet). The Greater Flamingo\u2019s large size allows it to wade into deeper water than most other flamingos.The flamingo\u2019s plumage is pinkish/white in color, with red wing coverts and black primary and secondary flight feathers. Their long, downward bending bills are pink with a black tip and their long, thin legs are also pink. Greater Flamingos have peculiar shaped heads on long, lean, curved necks with a distinctive downward bend. Flamingos have yellow eyes.",
            "habitat": "Greater Flamingos are found in a variety of saltwater habitats including salt or alkaline lakes, estuaries, shallow coastal lagoons and mudflats. The Greater Flamingo rarely inhabits areas of freshwater other than using freshwater inlets for bathing and drinking. Greater Flamingos that live outside the tropics often migrate to warmer climates for the winter months.",
            "diet": "Greater Flamingos are omnivores and filter-feeders. Flamingos mainly feed during the day and use their long legs and webbed feet to stir up the bottom of the water where they then sweep their bills upside down through the water. A flamingo\u2019s bill has a filter-like structure to remove food from the water before the liquid is drained.Water is sucked in through the partly opened bill. As it is squeezed out again by the tongue, a row of spines or lamellae along the edge of the bill filter out the tasty morsels within. They usually feed with their head fully immersed in the water and they can remain that way for up to 20 seconds. Flamingos pump their tongues up and down, 5 \u2013 6 times per second, pushing the water out of their beak.Flamingos also feed up on mollusks, plankton, crabs, tiny fish and insect larvae. Plant material is also eaten, including grass seeds and shoots, decaying leaves and algae.The flamingo\u2019s pink coloration comes from its diet of Shrimp and other pink crustaceans.Flamingo feathers are tinged a beautiful rose pink color due to colored materials called carotenoids in the tiny shrimps that they feed on. If they do not eat the shrimps, their feathers turn pale. Flamingos in captivity tend to be paler than wild species unless their diet is supplemented. In captivity, they are fed special food that contains these natural pigments to ensure that their feathers are colored.",
            "behaviour": "Greater Flamingos are gregarious birds and live together in flocks or dense colonies numbering between 10 \u2013 12 birds, such as those in the Galapagos Islands, to over 20,000 birds on the African salt lakes. In exceptional cases up to 200,000 pairs have been observed. These large flocks give them safety in numbers. Flocks remain closely packed and individuals are protected from predators by the other flock members while they have their heads down in the mud when feeding.Greater Flamingos are vocal birds and keep in contact with each other by producing a deep honking sound, similar to a Goose. They call loudly during courtship but they have a quieter call while they are feeding.These beautiful pink shore birds are surprisingly good swimmers but tend to thrive on the shallow mudflats and lagoons. Greater Flamingos are a remarkable sight when in flight with their long, thin neck outstretched in front and their long legs outstretched behind them. Flocks form either long, trailing lines or irregular shapes whilst flying.Flamingos are often seen standing on one leg. This stance is thought to keep the hidden leg warm amongst their feathers. On very hot days, flamingos may stand on both legs.Greater Flamingos are not territorial birds but will defend their nests during breeding season. Greater Flamingos have few natural predators, however, their eggs and chicks are preyed upon by other birds including the Marabou Stork.",
            "reproduction": "Greater Flamingos build their nests in pairs. Nests are made out of hardened mud with a shallow depression in the top, although a small pile of stones and debris, lined with grass, twigs and feathers, is used if mud is not available. One of the pair stands over the nest site and drags mud between its webbed feet with its curved bill. The mud is then pressed into place with the bill and feet. The nest of each mating pair is situated approximately 1.5 metres (4.9 feet) from neighbouring nests so the chick remains safe from other breeding pairs.Flamingos breed during April and May while gathered in groups on the extensive, warm, watery mudflats. Flamingos are are monogamous, meaning pairs stay together for life. At the beginning of the nesting season, flamingos perform spectacular group courtship displays of synchronized dancing, preening, neck stretching and honking.Like all species of flamingo, the female Greater Flamingo lays a single chalky-white egg on a mud mound in shallow water. The mating pair take turns to incubate the single egg. The egg hatches after 27 \u2013 31 days and the parents help the chick out of the egg by pulling pieces of the shell away.",
            "chicks": "Flamingo chicks are grey and white when born and do not develop their pink coloration for around 2 years. The chick is fed for at least the first 3 \u2013 4 weeks entirely by the parents who secrete a creamy pink liquid called \u2018crop milk\u2019 which comes from the parents upper digestive tract. Either parent can feed the chick this way and other flamingos can act as foster feeders.The chicks fledge after 10 weeks, but remain in creches for a further month. The chick is born with a straight bill which starts to curve at about one month and can filter feed properly at two and a half months. Amazingly, the adult flamingo is able to locate its chick from hundreds or thousands of other chicks, by its \u2018call\u2019.Flamingos are fully grown at 2 years and are able to mate at 3 years. Most flamingos will not breed for the first time until they are 5 to 10 years old. Flamingos may not breed when wetlands are dry and food is scarce. Some years, their feeding pools are teeming with life and there is plenty of food with which to feed their chicks. However, other years the pools are nearly empty. As a result, flamingos may only breed when conditions are just right.The Greater Flamingo can live to the age of over 60 years old in captivity. The average lifespan in the wild is around 30 \u2013 40 years.",
            "conservation status": "The Greater Flamingo is classed as \u2018Least Concern\u2019 by the IUCN. Although flamingos are numerous and believed to be increasing in some areas, the Greater Flamingo is vulnerable to changes or disturbance to its relatively limited number of breeding sites. Breeding success is often reduced as a result of human disturbance or lowering water levels, which can increase the salinity of feeding sites and so affect food resources.Climate change, and its potential effects on sea level and rainfall, may therefore have a serious impact on breeding sites in the future. The Greater Flamingo breeds quite well in captivity and breeding populations are currently maintained at various locations.\u00a0"

The Greater Horseshoe Bat can be easily identified by the flap of horseshoe shaped skin around its nostrils. The Greater Horseshoe Bat is known to eat large insects in flight and prefers to roost while hanging upside down. It is mostly active in woodland and often roosts underground. This species of bat is rare in Britain and is confined to just a small number of sites. Its breeding sites include Brockley Hall Stables near Bristol, Iford Manor near Bath and Littledean Hall in the Forest of Dean. The Greater Horseshoe Bats winter hibernation sites include Banwell Caves and Compton Martin Ochre Mine in the Mendip Hills, Chilmark Quarries in Wiltshire and Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines near Bath.

The Greater Mouse-eared bat was declared extinct about 12 years ago when the assumed last male died in Sussex, UK. About two years ago however, individuals have been discovered around Britain. One was found by an elderly lady in Bognor, but unfortunately it died. Last year a single young male was discovered hibernating in a tunnel near Chichester. Bats are very misunderstood mammals, they are not actually blind like they are said to be and they are very skillful flyers. Bats fly mainly at night and produce a stream of high-pitched calls and listen to the returning echoes which provide them with a distinct \u2018sound\u2019 picture of their surroundings."

The eyes are fixed on the stimulus and the eyebrows are raised and the scalp is retracted, the facial skin is also stretched by moving the ears back. Underneath the eye lids the color is different which contrasts sharply with the surrounding facial color.Staring with open mouth: This is the stare accompanied by the mouth being open but the teeth are covered. This is a threat expression and often occurs with head-bobbing.Head-bobbing: This is used as a threat display by the dryas monkey and head bobs up and down. This often occurs with staring with open mouth.Presenting: This behaviour is preformed by the female to elicit copulation from the male. This pattern tells the male that she is ready to mate.",
            "genus: cercopithecus \u2013 diana monkey": "The Diana Monkey (Cercopithecus diana) is often considered one of the most beautiful of the Old World monkeys. The Diana monkey is found in West Africa, from Sierra Leone to Ghana. The Diana monkey inhabits the primeval forests, but does not thrive in secondary forests.The Diana Monkey is active during the day. It rarely comes down to the ground, but feeds at all levels of the canopy, retreating to the upper levels of the trees at night, though it does not make nests.The Diana Monkey ranges from 40 to 55 centimetres in length, excluding its tail, which is 3 \u2013 4 centimetres in diameter and 50 \u2013 75 centimetres long. Diana Monkeys are generally black or dark grey, they have a white throat, crescent-shaped brow band, ruff and beard. The brow band gives the species its common name, since it was held to resemble the bow of the goddess Diana. The Diana Monkeys underarms are also white and they have a white stripe down their thighs, while the backs of their thighs and their lower backs are a chestnut color. Apart from the brow band, ruff and bear, and some fringes on their limbs, their fur is short and sleek in appearance. Adults weigh between 4 and 7 kilograms.Diana monkeys usually live in small groups. The size of the group may reach 30. There is usually only one adult male, two or three adult females and up to eight young. The male Diana monkey will not tolerate another adult male and warns them off with a head bobbing signal. When not resting during the hot noon hours, the group moves along calmly. A groups territory may encompass 0.19 to 0.38 square miles. Feeding and grooming is done in the safety of the middle to the high canopy of forests.Diana monkeys have marked coloration which allows a wide range of visual social signals and they also have a wide range of alarm calls, with different sounds for different predators. Diana monkeys emit different grunts and low croaks, but the cry of the Diana has been described as yowling. They also communicate with facial expressions and head movements.Diana monkeys feed mainly on fruit and insects, however, they will also take flowers, young leaves and invertebrates. Diana monkeys can pack their cheek pouches with the equivalent of about a stomachs load of food. This allows these monkeys to load up on food in places of danger or competition, then move on to a more secure location to eat. If the cheek pouches are full, the back of the hand is used to push food to the rear of the pouch. Food is very carefully processed (peeled, etc.) by hand and mouth to increase the quality and digestibility in the items swallowed.In good conditions, adult females reproduce yearly. Gestation lasts about 5 months and the young nurse from their mother for a further 6 months. Only a single infant is born. Although the young are born in a fairly well developed condition, with open eyes and able to grasp their mother. Diana Monkey mothers appear anxious and possessive, rarely letting young infants leave them. As infants grow, however, they become very playful. Juveniles reach sexual maturity at an age of about 3 years. Daughters remain in their mothers social groups, while males leave their natal groups shortly before attaining sexual maturity. Diana monkeys may live for up to 20 years in the wild. Their life span in captivity is 22 years.The Diana monkey is regarded as endangered by the IUCN as well as by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The main dangers to them are habitat destruction (they are now virtually confined to coastal areas) and hunting for bush meat. Forest tribes hunt them for food and professional hunters hunt them to sell in local markets, threatening their continued existence. Deforestation for farming has been the biggest factor in declining numbers. Diana monkeys are preyed upon by Crowned Hawk-eagles, leopards, chimpanzees and humans.\u00a0",
            "genus: cercopithecus \u2013 roloway monkey": "The Roloway monkey (Cercopithecus roloway) is one of the three most endangered monkeys of Ghana on the west coast of Africa. Roloway monkeys are an arboreal species found primarily in undisturbed, mature forests. Sadly, they do not appear to be very adaptable to changes in their habitat making them particularly vulnerable to human activity.Roloway monkeys are found in Ghana and eastern Cote d\u2019Ivoire, also found in Guinea, Ivory Coast, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Roloway monkeys mostly inhabit forests and are found under the canopy of the rainforests.The average size of an adult male Roloway monkey is around 5 kilograms and for females, 4 kilograms. Their facial hair color is black, however, they have a white beard. Orange coloring can be found on the inside of their back legs.Roloway monkeys live in groups of 15 to 30 individuals and like other primates, they interact and move with other primates in the forest. Male Roloway monkeys tend to permanently leave their family group at some point in their lives. Female Roloway monkeys are philopatric. This means they stay with the group that they were born into.Like all monkeys, Roloway monkeys communicate vocally. Their calls are used to alert the group to a predator or another monkey troop. It is a warning signal of danger. Males may also call to bring the troop back together if they have moved too far apart. Roloway monkeys also communicate visually. They stare when they are threatening another monkey or enemy. When they do this they also raise their eyebrows which pushes their scalp backwards, showing off the bright white fur on their brow line. Sometimes they also stare with their mouths open but not showing their teeth. This is also a threatening stance. Other times they also bob their heads while staring.Roloway monkeys are frugivore-insectivores meaning that they eat mainly fruit and insects. They also eat leaves and seeds.Roloway monkeys give birth to one offspring at a time after a gestation period of 5 \u2013 6 months. The life span of the Roloway monkey is 20 \u2013 30 years in captivity, it is unsure how long they live in the wild, but it would be rather shorter.The Roloway monkey is regarded as endangered by the IUCN. Roloway monkeys are preyed upon by Crowned Hawk-eagles, leopards, chimpanzees and humans. A recent decline of Roloway monkeys is most likely related to the decline in forest habitats and deforestation. In the past 100 years, Ghana has lost 80% of its forested lands. The monkeys are also endangered by extensive bush meat hunting. Over 800 tons of bush meat is sold in Ghana\u2019s markets every year.\u00a0",

At least 3 different guenon species have spots on their noses, the Greater Spot-nosed, Lesser Spot-nosed and the Red-tailed guenon.Greater Spot-Nosed monkeys are found in Liberia, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Nigeria, apparently to the Itimbiri River in NW Dem. Rep. Congo, Central African Republic, Rio Muni and Bioko (Equatorial Guinea). Greater Spot-Nosed monkeys appear to prefer rainforests alongside rivers.Greater Spot-Nosed Monkeys head and body length is 320 \u2013 450 miilimetres and tail length is 360 \u2013 525 millimetres. Males weigh about 1250 grams and females about 760 grams. Their fur is a greenish grey or black to greenish yellow or buff. Their under parts are white or greyish white.Greater Spot-Nosed monkeys have faces that are bare except for a few black hairs on the upper lip which is sometimes yellow. Their cheeks have yellow fur tipped with black and there is a black line which extends from the eye half the distance to the ear. Their eyes are black and are surrounded by yellow or orange skin.The fur at the top of the head is black and they have a mane of white which extends across the neck and chest from the base of one ear to the other. The outer limbs are a pale yellow tinged with red and the hands and feet are similarly colored. The tail is greyish brown or black above and yellowish bellow with a blackish tip. Variations among individuals are from an overall olive to a true green tint. The main diet of the Greater Spot-Nosed monkey consists of fruits and insects.Greater Spot-Nosed monkeys are apparently non-territorial, with adult males acting as leaders during the day and as guards at night. Adult females out number adult males. They live in small troops of 10 to 40 individuals dominated by a single male.Females are more territorial than males and they are the only permanent members of the group. Greater Spot-Nosed monkeys are not as social as some of the other primates and any grooming or socializing is usually seen between a mother and her infant. Males and females rarely interact unless it is breeding season.The gestation period of a female Greater Spot-Nosed monkey is between 158 \u2013 166 days. Infants weigh around 230 grams at birth. Sexual maturity is reached at age 4.5 in females and about 1 \u2013 2 years later in males. First births have been known to happen as early as the third year and as late as the seventh year.Births occur every 1 to 3 years and infants nurse from their mothers for around 6 months, however, they may begin eating solids at 2 months of age. There is a dominant male in these groups of monkey, however, that does not mean that he has fathered any of the infants in the group. During the breeding season, solitary males or males from other groups will infiltrate the group and mate with the females. The life span of the Greater Spot-Nosed monkey is 20 \u2013 25 years.Greater Spot-Nosed monkeys are classed as endangered because of habitat loss. Greater Spot-Nosed monkeys are preyed upon by big cats and hawks."

They can be found in almost every country, and reside in places where there is a lot of leafy greens for them to eat!Why are green caterpillars green?Caterpillars are green to help camouflage them against their surroundings. This is why you might be able to see the damage that caterpillars are doing to your plants, but not be able to actually see the animals! Some species also have special markings that make them look threatening to prey.Are green caterpillars poisonous?The answer to this is no. While there are some poisonous caterpillars, most of them are not. Many caterpillars look quite threatening, or have horns or spikes that look like they could do some serious damage. However, most of these caterpillars, even though they look this way, are actually unable to harm you.Some caterpillars ingest toxic substances from plants to give them a bitter taste to any animals that might eat them, but this isn\u2019t a problem to humans!What do green caterpillars eat?Green caterpillars can eat a variety of different foods. Many like to feed on vegetables you may have in your garden, such as broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussel sprouts and kale. Some also feed on leaves of fruit trees, or even leaves of larger trees such as oak trees. Unfortunately, because green caterpillars need to eat so much before they have the strength and energy to turn into butterflies and moths, they can do real damage to gardens!"

It belongs to the family Psittacidae and the order Psittaciformes. Belonging to the genus Pyrrhura, it is a part of the parrot subfamily Arinae, which groups together the long-tailed New World parrot species. There are six subspecies of green-cheeked parakeet: P. m. australis, P. m. flavoptera, P. m. hypoxantha, P. m. molinae, P. m. phoenicura and P. m. restricta. The species is also similar to the maroon-bellied parakeet, and similar in appearance to the blaze-winged parakeet and the black-capped parakeet. Green cheeked conures are highly popular pets and can be trained easily. They\u2019re also known to be very affectionate with their owners. They are brightly colored, and are being selectively bred to create even more color mutations, too. This coloration allows them to remain camouflaged in their natural environment and, thanks to this, they have very few natural predators.",

They are active during the day, and sleep in their nests inside tree trunks at night.They are the quietest of the conures. However, as pets, they can be trained to do tricks and talk with a limited vocabulary. They are sociable animals as pets, and will want a lot of attention. They often try to draw the attention of their owner by hanging upside down, or dancing around on their perches, or even by hiding under papers.",
            "green-cheeked conure reproduction": "This bird species nests in hollow trees. They have a clutch size of between 4 to 6 eggs and the incubation period lasts anywhere from 22 to 25 days.

Gestation of the female zebra lasts 350 \u2013 400 days, with a single foal being born. A newborn zebra will follow anything that moves and therefore, new mothers are highly aggressive towards other mares a few hours after they gave birth. This prevents the foal from acquiring another female as its mother.To adapt to an arid lifestyle, Grevy\u2019s zebra foals take longer intervals between suckling bouts and do not drink water until they are 3 months old. They also and reach independence from the mare sooner than other equids. Foals nurse heavily for half a year and may travel with their mothers for 3 years.The Grevy\u2019s zebra foal is able to walk an hour after birth and is able to graze within a few weeks. Groups of females with their young offspring generally form herds of up to 200 animals. In captivity, the Grevy\u2019s zebra life span can be as long as 40 years. In the wild, they usually live about 20 years or shorter.",

Females will choose males that have a more vibrant plumage and flamboyant neck feathers with bright yellow spots on the black cape. The males shred their neck feathers once the breeding is over.The female lays between 4 and 7 pale creamy eggs which are incubated for 21 days. Males will often make dutiful fathers, brooding chicks on or close to the ground on rainy nights. The female rears the chicks for around 9 weeks and then abandons them to the male while she incubates a new clutch of fertile eggs.Sometimes, the grey junglefowl will hybridize in the wild with the red junglefowl. They also hybridize in captivity and sometimes with free-range domestic chickens kept in habitations close to forests.Grey Jungle Fowl Conservation StatusGrey Junglefowl are classed as \u2018Least Concern\u2019 by the IUCN.

The grey partridge is smaller than the pheasant and red legged partridge, but is bigger than the quail. The scientific name is the Latin for \u201cpartridge\u201d, and is itself derived from Ancient Greek perdix.",

            "diet": "The grey partridge is an omnivore and 95% of their diet at this stage consists of vegetarian or plant-based foods like fruits, leaves, weed seeds, roots, and flowers. The remaining 5% of the diet is fulfilled through proteins like insects and lichens. Their diet pattern can vary depending upon the type of food available, but they are more likely to eat waste grain and insects during the summer months.",
            "behavior": "They grey partridge lives in large groups, which are known as coveys. There can be 20 or more birds in a covey. Birds in a covey stay together in the entire autumn and winter season and may start to leave the covey at the beginning of January as the winter draws its end.This bird species is not aggressive or territorial outside of the breeding season. However, they may exhibit this behavior during the breeding season. To communicate, the grey partridge makes short and scratchy calls that are not even a second long. The song is a harsh, high-pitched kieerr-ik, and when disturbed, like most of the gamebirds.When disturbed, the grey partridge flies a short distance on rounded wings, often calling \u2018rick rick rick\u2019 as it rises. While they cannot fly well for long distances, they can fly strongly for short distances. However, they prefer to walk rather than fly.The grey partridge is most active at dawn and dusk. They are clean and hygienic animals. They have a habit of daily grooming within their natural environment. Daily grooming keeps them clean and healthy and also helps in keeping the parasites and harmful microorganisms away.",
            "reproduction": "The grey partridge usually breeds from late April to July. They nest on a ground nest, which is not common for most other birds. They make their nests with grasses. The nest is usually in the margin of a cereal field, most commonly winter wheat.Grey partridges are monogamous and start forming pair four months before breeding. Hens can lay up to twenty eggs in a ground nest, and incubates them for 20 to 25 days, while males guard the nest.A baby partridge is known as a cheepeer. The young partridge are cared for by both parents. They are usually yellow-brown in color and lack the distinctive face and underpart markings of an adult partridge. The cheepeers are able to make short flights after 10 to 12 days, and can fly like an adult by 20 days.Despite the fact that an adult grey partridge has a diet that is made up of 95% plant-based foods, during the first three weeks of their life, the partridges have to intake proteins in an abundant amount to aid the development of the bones and muscles. During this stage, more than 50% of the partridge\u2019s diet consists of small insects, such as crickets, beetles, and larvae.

The grey partridge is a non-migratory terrestrial species, which forms flocks outside the breeding season.Grey Partridge Conservation StatusGenerally, the grey partridge has a large range and is not currently threatened. It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.Despite this, the bird is declining greatly in numbers in areas of intensive cultivation such as Great Britain, due to loss of breeding habitat and food supplies. Their numbers have fallen by 85% in the last 25 years. Efforts are being made in Great Britain to halt the decline by creating Conservation headlands. In 1995 the Grey Partridge was nominated a Biodiversity Action plan species.The biggest reasons for the decline in the number of grey partridge are loss of breeding habitat and and the insecticides being used on crops are reducing the insect numbers, which is an important food source for these birds.",
            "predators": "The grey partridge bird is vulnerable to predators at all stages of its life cycle. During the breeding season, unattended eggs can be taken by corvids, rats, hedgehogs, small mustelids, cats and wild boar, as well as larger predators such as foxes and badgers. Fledged juveniles and adult birds can be taken mainly by foxes, mustelids, hawks, harriers and buzzards.They grey partridge uses its plumage to help disguise itself from predators, and also remains in groups for protection.",

Sometimes they eat a seabird or two. Small fish are swallowed whole, while larger ones are held in the seals mouth and torn into smaller, more easily swallowed pieces with the claws on the front flippers.",
            "behaviour": "Grey seals congregate in large groups for breeding, pupping and molting. During the four- to six-week-long breeding period, neither males nor females eat, drawing from their fat (blubber) for nutrition. Size and fat reserves play an important part in successful breeding. Male seals that can spend more time on land chasing females, and less time feeding at sea, have greater mating success. Grey seals also gather in small groups to rest on land. However, when it comes to finding food, Grey seals dive alone or in small groups.",
            "reproduction": "Female Grey seal can breed at around 4 years old whereas female Common seals must be 3 \u2013 7 years old to breed and males must be 3 \u2013 8 years old.The gestation period of the female Grey seal is 11.5 months, including a 3 month delay in the implantation of the fertilised egg. Grey seals give birth to a single pup on beaches or in hidden sea caves from July to November. The pup weighs about 15 kilograms at birth and is born with a silky white coat or lunugo, which is moulted at around 9 \u2013 18 days old. Pups gain about 2 kilograms of weight a day due to the high fat content of their mothers milk (60 per cent fat). After 3 weeks of suckling the pup, the female mates again and then leaves the breeding area (rookery).In the wild, grey seal females live up to 40 years, while males live up to 30 years.",

Male Grey Wolves are larger than the females and can even grow to weigh as much as 175 pounds in some cases. Grey Wolves stand between 27- 32 inches at the shoulder.Wolves can appear much larger than they already are, this is because of their long fur. In winter when their fur is fully grown, their fur can be as long as 2 \u2013 2.5 inches on their backs and sides. The hairs in their mane can be as long as 4 \u2013 5 inches long and when stood upright, this makes them appear taller.The length of the Grey Wolf varies between 50 and 70 inches long from nose tip to tail tip. A third of this length is the length of its tail.Compared to a large dog, a wolf has a narrower chest and longer legs. Because their chests are narrow, their left and right footprints are closer together than those of a dogs.\u00a0Grey Wolves have very strong jaws. Wolves have 42 teeth altogether. These consist of: 12 incisors, 4 canines, 16 pre-molars and 10 carnassials and molars. A wolfs canine teeth can be as long as 1 inch long.A wolfs teeth are extremely sharp, strong and slightly curved. This enables them to grasp their prey in their teeth and chew down to the soft marrow in the bones. It also helps the wolf to eat nearly all of its prey, leaving very little waste.Wolf paws are able to traverse easily through a wide variety of terrains, especially snow. There is a slight webbing between each toe, which allows wolves to move over snow more easily than comparatively hampered prey.Wolves are digitigrades, so the relative largeness of their feet helps to better distribute their weight on snowy surfaces. The front paws are larger than the hind paws and feature a fifth digit, a dew claw, (a claw that grows higher on the leg so that, when the animal is standing, it does not make contact with the ground) that is absent on hind paws.Bristled hairs and blunt claws enhance grip on slippery surfaces, and special blood vessels keep paw pads from freezing.\u00a0",

Grivet monkeys have close-fitting moderate length hairs over most of their body.The first digit on their hands and feet are opposable allowing the Vervet monkeys to grab hold of objects. Their hands are used for moving, feeding and grooming. The hind legs are especially strong for leaping across branches. Their long tails are not prehensile, but are used for balance, steering and braking while leaping from branch to branch. Grivet monkeys have cheek pouches to store their food as they move to a safer place to eat. When full, the cheek pouches can hold an amount of food equal to what the stomach can hold.Grivet monkeys live in groups of 10 to 27 within a protected territory. They are most active in the morning and in the late evening. Grivet monkeys sleep in the trees but do spend some time on the ground. They are never far from water and are good swimmers. When they become excited or angry, they grimace and expose their teeth.Grooming is a common behaviour among most primates and Grivet monkeys are no exception. Grooming is commonly used as a courtship strategy. Grivet monkeys are omnivorous, however. they have a heavy preference for fruits and grains. In the wild, They will eat fruit, leaves, grain, roots and occasionally reptiles, young birds and insects.Currently specific to the island of Saint Kitts the Grivet monkeys have developed one annoying habit to many tourists. The monkeys have developed a taste for alcoholic tropical fruit drinks. The monkeys will commonly steal brightly colored drinks left behind by tourists on the beach. Many tourists have also found out these monkeys will deliver a powerful bite if they are cornered. Care should be taken when approaching any Grivet monkeys. If at one point they were domesticated in the centuries gone past, they are no longer.Grivet monkeys have a gestation period of about 7 months. Females usually give birth to a single offspring. They breed from July to November. The young clings to its mothers belly and can support its own weight. Other adult monkeys may help in caring for and protecting the babies. Grivet monkeys can live to be 30 years old.Grivet monkeys are classed as being \u2018threatened\u2019 due to continuous deforestation and destruction of their natural habitat. Potential predators of the Grivet monkeys include lions, leopards."

They normally eat injured or weak animals, and avoid healthy ones so there is less work when preying.These bears have also been known to eat birds and their eggs, and sometimes attack the nests of bald eagles. They can also be a nuisance to farmers and cause economical loss as they can target cattle and sheep.Grizzly bears may eat about 90 lbs (40 kg) food per day, which can mean they gain a body weight of around 2.2 lbs (1 kg) or more per day. In preparation for the winter, grizzly bears increase their food intake during the summer in order to put on weight.This is particularly important for females as they need sufficient fat reserves to give birth to and nurse cubs before leaving their winter den.In coastal regions, such as in British Columbia and Alaska, grizzly bears supplement their diet with protein. For this reason, Alaskan or Canadian grizzly bears tend to grow bigger than those found in mountainous and other non-coastal regions.",
            "behavior": "Grizzly bears are solitary animals, with the exception of mothers and cubs, or if a plentiful food source is found. They use sounds, such as growling, moaning or grunting, movement, and smells to communicate.They can run fast, at around 35 miles an hour for very short sprints, and are also good swimmers.Cubs are good at climbing trees to avoid danger, but they lose this ability as they get older. Grizzlies will often rub their bodies on trees to scratch and to let other bears know they are there.",
            "breeding": "Grizzly bears are one of the animals with lowest reproductive rate. They begin to look for mates in the spring and early summer, and females will mate with more than one male during her breeding season.When a female grizzly becomes pregnant, the development of the embryo temporarily stops for several months. This is a process called \u201cdelayed implantation\u201d, and allows the female time to get herself ready to carry a cub.If a female bear is unable to gain enough weight during the summer and fall, her body will tell her to not proceed with the pregnancy and the embryo will reabsorb.When female grizzly bears enter hibernation, the embryo implants in her uterus. The gestation period is between 180 to 250 days and, in January or February, female grizzly bears give birth to one to four cubs (usually two). Newborn bears may weigh less than 500 grams (1.1 lb).Mothers will care for her young inside the den until spring, feeding them milk, and are extremely protective. Once they leave the den after hibernation, they will begin to eat solid food as well as milk.They stay with their mother for around 2 years, but it can be longer if food is scarce. Grizzly bears reach sexual maturity at around 5 years old.",
            "hibernation": "Grizzly bears hibernate at the beginning of winter, usually around late November, but the date depends on the temperature, food supply, and snowfall. In places where the climate is warm, such as California, bears do not hibernate. The main reason for hibernation is the cold weather and lack of food during this time.They hibernate in dens, which are usually located on north-facing slopes an altitude of about 1,800 meters (5,900 feet). Before they hibernate, grizzly bears go through a period of hyperphagia or polyphagia (extreme sensation of hunger or strong desire for eating), and consume a large amount of food.During this time they can gain up to 180 kg (400 lbs)! Pregnant females are the first to enter dens, followed by females with cubs, and solitary males enter dens last.While hibernating, grizzly bears do not eat or even go to the bathroom. They enter a deep sleep, and their heart beat slows from 40 beats per minute to only 8 beats per minute. However, their hibernation is not as deep of a sleep as some other hibernators, like bats or ground squirrels, and they will quickly wake up when disturbed.Pregnant females give birth in the dens and nurse their cubs until they are large enough to venture outside in the spring. Male grizzlies wake up from hibernation in mid-March, while females and grizzly cubs are the last to leave the den, in about April or May.",
            "interaction with humans": "Grizzly bears are shy in nature and usually avoid humans. They are only dangerous when provoked or if a mother is trying to protect her cubs. Bears are around 3 to 6 times stronger compared to an average human!If a grizzly bear attacks you, it is advised you do not run, lay flat on your stomach, and play dead. You should grasp your hands tightly behind your neck and spread your legs. This posture will make it harder for the grizzly bear to turn you over.",
            "preying behavior": "When preying on animals, grizzly bears usually stalk young, weak or injured animals. To find rodents and grubs, they will dig through the ground and overturn rocks. To catch fish, especially salmon, the bears will wait at the base of waterfalls and catch any that are leaping.Location and HabitatGrizzly bears are found in North American areas, and their range covers Alaska, much of western Canada, parts of northwestern United States (Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming), and extends as far south as Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks.In Canada, they can be found in British Columbia, Alberta, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and the northern regions of Manitoba. Their range can cover up to 600 miles, so they need a lot of space!These bears used to be found in all of the western United States and south into Mexico, including the Great Plains and along rivers in desert habitats. However, control actions and habitat loss mean that they inhabit much less of the area nowadays \u2014 in fact, they only inhabit 2% of the area they used to!The grizzly bear habitat can be diverse. They can live in woodlands, forests, alpine meadows, and prairies. They prefer areas away from human development and places that have space to dig their burrows and dens. They also enjoy areas along rivers and streams.They can be found in a few national parks in the US, including Glacier National Park, Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park and Denali National Park.",
            "importance": "Grizzly bears are considered a keystone species, meaning they are very important to the wildlife and environment. They help to distribute seeds as they eat fruits of many fruit-bearing plants and excrete seeds along with nutrients in their faeces. They dig and turn over soil, too, helping to increase the amount of species in the ecosystem.Grizzly bears also help to control the population of other animals within forests, which in turn helps with overgrazing in the forests.Conservation StatusAfter the bear species was eliminated from much of its original range, grizzly bears were placed under the Endangered Species Act in 1975.Because of this, their numbers have begun to grow again and they are now listed as \u201cleast concern\u201d by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.While hunting of these bears in banned inside national parks, hunting is now permitted outside the boundary of Yellowstone National Park.",
            "threats": "Humans are the biggest threat to grizzly bears, particularly if bears go into human-occupied areas to look for food or habitat and are killed. Hunting is also now permitted of these bears in certain areas.Human development also contributes as a threat to these animals, as it results in habitat loss.Conservation strategies have been put in place to try to aid this.Climate change is another big threat to grizzlies, as it impacts food availability, as well as weather changes which affect their hibernation periods and allow for beetle infestation and fungal disease to grow on plants they consume.Articles that Mention Grizzly BearsHow Long do Bears Live?Bear Size ComparisonExamples of Apex Predators14 Incredible Hybrid AnimalsList of Omnivorous Animals"

Most species of Ground Beetle are carnivorous, and some will run swiftly to catch their prey. Although there is some variation in their body shape and coloring, most are shiny, black (some are metallic) and have ridged elytra (wing covers).  Ground beetles in the genus \u2018Brachinus\u2019 are commonly known as \u2018Bombardier Beetles\u2019 (more than 500 species altogether).

The Ground centipede has at least 37 pairs of rather short legs. The body of the Ground centipede narrows towards the back, with the widest point being just in front of the middle. The segments in the rear half of the body are a little longer than those in the front half, so the rear legs are a little further apart than those at the front. The plates covering the top and bottom of each trunk segment, apart from the first and last, are each divided horizontally into two sections. A small amount of movement is possible between each section and the overall effect is to double the amount of joints in the body. This makes the centipede extremely flexible, and it can fold itself in half very easily.",

A small amount of movement is possible between each section and the overall effect is to double the amount of joints in the body. This makes the centipede extremely flexible, and it can fold itself in half very easily.This flexibility has obviously evolved because of the centipedes connection with the soil, where the ability to be able to move around in a confined space, is more important than speed.The antennae and the sensitive hind legs are quite short, again in connection with the subterranean way of life, longer legs would get in the way and would also soon get broken.Ground centipedes have no eyes. Several of the species give out phosphorescent fluid (phosphorescent meaning giving out light without the heat) when they are disturbed. This can be used to frighten off some of the centipedes predators. Some of the species also emit a fairly strong almond smell when they are handled.",
            "reproduction": "Ground centipedes usually lay their eggs in the spring. The female digs out a small chamber in the soil and lays thirty or forty eggs there. She then coils her body around them and remains there for several weeks, until the eggs have hatched and the young centipedes are able to fend for themselves.If the female is removed, the eggs generally go mouldy and die. It is believed that the females lick their eggs from time to time, and in doing so, either remove mould spores or else spread a mould-killing substance over the eggs (similar to earwigs).The young centipedes emerge from the eggs with a full set of legs, although these are short stumps to start with. The babies remain in the brood chamber with their mother for about eight weeks, during which time they change their skins twice.The legs and the poison claws become more fully developed during this period as well, and the baby centipedes gradually disperse to fend for themselves. They have to change their skins several times more, and become longer, before they are fully mature."

The groundhog is found in North America, particularly in the Eastern United States, across Canada and into Alaska. Groundhogs are different to other marmots in the fact that they are a lowland animal and do not live in rocky and mountainous areas. They are also very solitary which is unusual for the genus, and do not create long-term bonds with other individuals. There are many other names the groundhog is known by. These include the chuck, wood-shock, groundpig, whistlepig, whistler, thickwood badger, Canada marmot, monax, moonack, weenusk, red monk and land beaver.",
            "lifespan": "The groundhog has an average lifespan of between 2 to 6 years in the wild. Deaths are usually the result of predation or disease. In captivity, they can live for up to 10 years.",
            "diet": "These hogs are mostly a herbivore and primarily eat wild grasses and other vegetation. This includes alfalfa, clover, dandelion, sheep sorrel, timothy-grass, buttercup, tearthumb, agrimony, and buckwheat. They also eat berries and agricultural crops, such as red and black raspberries, mulberries, plantain and wild lettuce.They also eat small animals on occasion, such as grubs, grasshoppers, snails, and even baby birds. However, they are not as omnivorous as many other members of Sciuridae.These animals eat more than a pound of vegetation daily. They are a hibernating species and, instead of storing food, they stuff themselves to survive the winter without eating. In early June, their metabolism slows and their weight increases by as much as 100%.They do not drink water, and get all their liquid from the juices of food-plants.Groundhogs are diurnal and their feeding activity is highest during morning and afternoon. They usually forage in sessions of 2 hours.",
            "behavior": "Groundhogs are diurnal and are active during the day. They are always alert when not in their burrow, and are often seen standing erect on their hind feet watching for danger. They will use a high-pitched whistle to warn the rest of the colony when there is danger, even though they are not very social animals.The groundhog is territorial and primarily solitary, although will sometimes greet each other nose to nose. They can communicate with other vocalizations such as low barks, and also use their scent glands.Groundhogs enter into true hibernation and are one of the few species to do so. They will often build a separate \u201cwinter burrow\u201d for this purpose. They hibernate from October to early spring, around March or April, in most areas, although in warmer areas will hibernate as little as three months. Some fellow hibernators, such as rabbits, opossums, raccoons and skunks, will move in with groundhogs for the winter, hibernating in one of the rooms in their burrow network.When they enter into hibernation, their body temperature drops to as low as 35 degrees Fahrenheit, their heart rate falls to 4\u201310 beats per minute and their breathing rate falls to one breath every six minutes. Males emerge from hibernation before females.",
            "reproduction": "Groundhogs mate soon after emerging from hibernation. Females are monoestrous and mating occurs only during the spring. Males emerge from hibernation first so they can establish territories, dominance hierarchies, and search for mates. Groundhogs are polygynous, with males having multiple mates per season.The gestation period is between 31 to 32 days and the litter size is usually between 3 and 5 pups, although it can be as many as 9. The groundhog pups weigh between 26 and 27 grams at birth and become independent very quickly and leave the mother around age 2 months old.The groundhog become sexually mature by the age of 2, although some can reproduce at the age of 1.",
            "location and habitat": "Groundhogs are the most widespread North American marmot species. In the south, they extend from eastern Oklahoma, northern Louisiana, Alabama, and Georgia to North Carolina, in the east, they extend from North Carolina, along the Atlantic coast, to Labrador, Canada, and in the north extend from Labrador to southern Alaska.They prefer the open country and the edges of woodland, in low-elevation forests, small woodlots, fields, pastures and hedgerows. They create their dens in well drained soils, and most have summer and winter dens. Summer dens are located near food sources and winter dens are located near protective cover. The groundhog is rarely far from its den entrance.Burrows are used for safety, protection, mating, sleeping and raising young. The den is lined with dead leaves and dried grasses and it usually has two openings or holes \u2014 one for entering and one used as a spy hole.Groundhog Conservation StatusGroundhogs are common throughout their range and are therefore listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.Both their diet and their habit of burrowing make them serious nuisance animals around farms and gardens. They will eat many commonly grown vegetables, and their burrows can also destroy foundations. In some areas, groundhogs are game animals and are killed regularly for sport, food, or fur.",
            "predators": "The main predators of groundhogs are coyotes, badgers, bobcats and foxes. These predators are successful stealth stalkers so can catch groundhogs by surprise. The groundhog can also be hunted by golden eagles and great horned owls.Young groundhogs, less than a couple of months in age, can be eaten by American mink, hawks and rattlesnakes.Groundhogs escape predators by retreating into their burrows. They also use their large claws and incisors to fight off any predators. They can also climb trees to help escape any threats.\u00a0"

Guinea Pigs are part of the Rodent family which also includes rats, mice, hamsters, squirrels and beavers. Guinea Pigs originated from South America where they still live in the wild today. In the wild Guinea Pigs tend to make their habitats in rocky areas, grasslands and forests.",
            "as pets": "Guinea Pigs make wonderful, ideal, lovable pets that are easy to keep and give you a lot of joy in return. Guinea Pigs need lots of love and attention, they need to be handled very gently so not to injure them and they need clean housing and plenty of healthy food. Although they are generally easy to keep and generally healthy animals, they do need the usual check-ups with the vet and some home grooming too.One of the first issues to cross when deciding to have a Guinea Pig as a pet, is choosing one (or two). You will then need to decide whether you are keeping them indoors or outdoors as obviously different housing will be required for each location. It is always best to do a bit of homework on your desired pet before making the decision to have one and Guinea Pigs are no exception.Any pet which is furry is going to have an effect on someone who has allergies or asthma, so these issues have to be taken into consideration. Also, have you got adequate room for your pet (and its hutch). If you have a neighbourhood with many cats, keeping a Guinea Pig outside would not be a good idea as cats can be very intimidating to small furry animals.",
            "choosing a guinea pig": "When the time comes that you have definitely decided to have a Guinea Pig as a pet, the next step is going to a good pet shop or experienced Guinea Pig breeder and choosing your Guinea Pig/s.There are lots of different breeds and colors to choose from, but if you are not particularly interested in a specific breed or color, then short-haired Guinea Pigs are your best buy. Because they are short-haired, they take less grooming and are easier to manage. They are just as beatuiful as some of the longer haired guinea pigs aswell.Guinea Pigs can get lonely on their own and if you have not got the time to give it constant love and attention, then it is a good idea to buy two Guinea Pigs. Always make sure you have two of the same sex (either two boys or two girls). Unless you want to end up with lots of puppies (baby Guinea Pigs), then this is very important. It is also common for two males to fight, so unless you are used to keeping Guinea Pigs, it is highly recommended that two females are perfect for the first time Guinea Pig buyers. Buying two baby Guinea Pigs together will not only give you double joy, but it will allow the Guinea Pigs to bond early and grow-up together and they will never be lonely.Guinea pigs are ideally bought when they are at least 6 weeks old, either from a new litter from a breeder who will definitely know their age and sex, or from a pet store. But be very careful with the pet store as the age of the Guinea Pig can be deceiving and if they have not been monitored properly, you could end up buying an already pregnant Guinea Pig. Animal shelters or rescues are also good places to get your Guinea Pig from. There are usually many there who are in need of a good home and make terrific pets just as much as getting a baby one would.Here is a check list to make sure you choose a healthy Guinea Pig:The puppies (baby guinea pigs) that you choose should be plump and well fed.Guinea Pigs should have bright eyes and clear ears and nose and should have shiny, silky fur all over including under the bottom.Guinea Pigs should be firm and when awake, very alert. Make sure they are running about fine on all four legs.Listen to their breathing and make sure it is quiet and not laboured, restrained or wheezy.Check their bodies for lumps or swellings.Make sure their poops/droppings are like little oval pellets and not runny which can be a sign of diarrhoea.When selecting a Guinea Pig from a breeder, all the Guinea Pigs in the cage should first be inspected because if one Guinea Pig appears ill, the others may also be at risk of being ill so it is best to look elsewhere. The cages themselves should be clean and not overcrowded and the Guinea Pigs should have access to food and water. Any droppings in the cage should be firm and not runny.Do not forget one more thing!. Before rushing out to buy your Guinea Pigs, you will need a home for them to bring them back to. It is a good idea to get everything ready for your Guinea Pigs prior to bringing them home."

The color of its plumage is brown and there are hints of iridescent purple on its back.The Hamerkop\u2019s bill is long and flat and slightly hooked at the tip and their is a square, blunt crest on its nape. Compared to other wading birds, its legs and neck are shorter in length. The Hamerkop\u2019s feet are partially webbed and its middle toe is comb-like (pectinated), similar to that of a Herons, and is used to groom its feathers.The Hamerkop\u2019s wings are large, broad and rounded and its tail is short. The Hamerkop has a wingspan of 90 \u2013 94 centimetres. The Hamerkop is so named because of its hammer-shaped head.",
            "hamerkop habitat": "The Hamerkop prefers wetland habitats such as all types of shallow slow moving or still waters including irrigated land such as rice fields, also savannas and forests. Territories are dominated by pairs. Hamerkops move in quickly when new bodies of water occur such as dams or canals.",
            "hamerkop diet": "Hamerkops usually feed alone or in pairs and mainly during the daytime, taking a rest at noon to roost. Their diet consists of mainly aquatic invertebrates and they will also eat fish, insects, shrimp and rodents. They wade through shallow water searching for prey. To flush prey out of hiding, they rake their feet through the water bed or flap their wings to startle what ever is hiding in the mud or under rocks.",
            "hamerkop behaviour": "Hamerkops are soaring birds who fly with slow wing beats and stretch their necks forward when in flight. When flapping their wings, their necks coil backwards. Hamerkops are vocal birds when in groups and produce \u2018keks\u2019, \u2018yips\u2019 and shrills when in flight, otherwise they are generally silent birds particularly when alone. It will often perch on the backs of hippopotamuses, spying the ground for frogs.Hamerkops have a very strange behaviour that is unlike other birds. Several or more of the birds get together and perform rituals or courtship displays that involve running around each other in circles, fluttering their wings, raising their crests and calling loudly. Another unusual feature is \u2018false mounting\u2019. This involves one bird standing on top of another and appearing to copulate, however, neither are mates and copulation does not actually take place.Another unique feature of the Hamerkop is that, although they are only medium-sized birds, they have huge nests that can measure over 2 metres in depth and width and weigh up to 50 kilograms in weight. These nests are made from 1000\u2019s of sticks, twigs. reeds. grasses and stems of aquatic vegetation held together by mud and are so strong that they could hold the weight of a man. They take around 3 \u2013 6 weeks to complete having been worked on by both members of a pair.Nest walls are built on a sturdy platform and topped with a domed roof. A mud-plastered entrance 13 to 18 centimetres wide in the bottom leads through a tunnel up to 60 centimetres long to a nesting chamber large enough for the parents and their young. The outside of the nests are decorated with bright objects that the birds collect.Nests are often built in the fork of a tree, on a cliff ledge, a water bank, or dam and preferably over a water source. Hamerkops are obssessed with building nests and will construct 3 \u2013 5 nests per year in their territory, whether they are for breeding purposes or not. When nests are completed, a pair of Hamerkops will perform a display or ritual similar to the ones afore-mentioned.Nests are sometimes taken over by Eagles or Barn Owls, but may be recalimed by the Hamerkops once the intruders have left.",
            "hamerkop reproduction": "The female Hamerkop lays between 3 and 7 white eggs that soon become soiled and stained. Both male and female take turns to incubate the eggs over a period of 28 \u2013 30 days. Both parents care and feed the young although chicks may be left in the safety of their huge nests for long periods of time which is quite common with wading birds.The hatchlings are covered in a grey down and have broad bills. At around 17 days old, the chick\u2019s head and crest plumage has developed. Juveniles are able to leave the nest at 44 \u2013 50 days old but roost in the nests during the night for around 2 months after hatching.",
            "hamerkop conservation status": "The Hamerkop is classed as \u2018Least Concern\u2019 by the IUCN.Did you know this about Hamerkops?The Hamerkop has supernatural powers for the indigenous people:There are many legends about the Hamerkop. In some regions, people state that other birds help it build its nest.In some cultures, the Hamerkop is known as the \u2018lightning bird\u2019, and the Kalahari Bushmen believe or believed that being hit by lightning resulted from trying to rob a Hamerkop\u2019s nest. They also believe that the inimical god, Khauna, would not like anyone to kill a Hamerkop.According to an old Malagasy belief, anyone who destroys a Hamerkop\u2019s nest will get leprosy, and a Malagasy poem calls it an \u2018evil bird\u2019."

The Harbour Porpoise often ventures up rivers and has been seen hundreds of miles from the sea. The English word porpoise comes from the French pourpois, which is from Medieval Latin porcopiscus, which is a compound of porcus (pig) and piscus (fish). They belong to the family Phocoenidae and the order Artiodactyla. The harbor porpoise is sometimes known as the Common Porpoise, though this usage appears to be dying out. These animals are not currently endangered, and are listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.",

They mainly eat small fish, crustaceans, and cephalopods, such as squids, octopuses and cuttlefish. Young porpoises need to consume about 7% to 8% of their body weight each day in order to survive.",
            "behavior": "The harbour porpoise is most often seen alone or in small groups of 2-3 animals. Cooperative foraging has not been commonly observed in this species.Harbour porpoises can be difficult to spot and sightings are not that common. This is mainly due to their size, as well as the fact they generally spend little time at the surface and do not often engage in visible behaviours such as breaching or tail slapping. Harbour porpoises are not deep divers and generally make short but frequent dives from the surface. The deepest dive recorded was 224 metres (735 feet) deep. Dives can last five minutes but typically last one minute.While there are noticeable seasonal shifts in distribution in certain locations, these marine mammals do not appear to undertake coordinated migrations. Tidal currents appear to influence movements in a number of locations.The harbour porpoise produces short pulsed high frequency (110-180 kHz) \u201cclick\u201d sounds, primarily for echolocation. These sounds do not carry very far under water. It is thought that this click activity is linked to foraging behavior, and most commonly happens at night. However, they also use these click sounds to communicate with each other.",
            "reproduction": "Porpoises mate promiscuously, and males produce large amounts of sperm, perhaps for sperm competition. Females can calve each year for several consecutive years, being pregnant and lactating at the same time.The gestation of the porpoise is typically 10 to 11 months and most births occur in late spring and summer. The calves are weaned after 8 to 12 months and remain with their mother for a period of around 18 months. Females reach sexual maturity by their third or fourth year.",
            "location and habitat": "The harbour porpoise is widespread in cooler coastal waters in the Northern Hemisphere, largely in areas with a mean temperature of about 15\u00b0C including the coasts of Spain, France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, Iceland, Greenland and Newfoundland. The population in the Baltic Sea is limited in winter due to sea freezing.They are found in the western North Atlantic, along the United States coast as far south as northern Florida, and in the eastern North Atlantic, they range as far south as Senegal in Northwest Africa and as far north as Novaya Zemlya and the Barents Sea. There is another band in the Pacific Ocean running from the Sea of Japan, Vladivostok, the Bering Strait, Alaska, Canada, and California. They are also found in the North Pacific and the Black Sea. They are found primarily at depths of 20-200 m.Harbour Porpoise Conservation StatusThe harbour porpoise is very abundant, with a current global population numbering around 700,000. Therefore, they are not considered threatened. The harbour porpoise populations of the North Sea, Baltic Sea, western North Atlantic, Black Sea and North West Africa are protected under Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS).Harbour porpoises are not and never have been actively hunted by whalers because they are too small to be of interest. That being said, they were traditionally hunted for food, as well as for their blubber, which was used for lighting fuel.The biggest concern for harbour porpoises is the large number of porpoises caught each year in gill nets and other fishery equipment. This problem has led to a documented decrease in the number of harbour porpoises in busy fishing seas. It is known that the porpoises echolocation is sufficiently discriminating to detect the presence of the fishing nets, but this does not stop porpoises from becoming trapped.Scientists have developed beacons to attach to the nets to try to deter curious porpoises. These are not yet widespread and there is some controversy regarding their use some concerns have been raised about the value of adding more noise pollution to the seas.Other threats include overfishing which may reduce preferred prey availability for porpoises, and underwater noise from ship traffic and oil platforms which could affect echoloctaion in these animals. On top of this, climate change and an increase in temperature of the sea water is likely to affect the distribution of porpoises and their prey.",
            "s predators": "Harbor porpoises are preyed on by white sharks, killer whales and grey seals. There have also been violent and fatal attacks on harbour porpoises by bottlenose dolphins reported.",
            "fun fact": "Conjoined twins are rarely seen in mammals, but a two-headed harbour porpoise was documented in May 2017 when Dutch fishermen in the North Sea caught them by chance!\u00a0"

            "desc": "The Harp Seal is an aquatic mammal belonging to the Suborder Pinnipedia (fin-footed animals) and the Family Phocidae (true seals lacking external ears) that is found in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. Harp Seals are separated into 3 populations based on where they breed, the White Sea, the West Ice and the Northwest Atlantic `Gulf\u2019 and `Front\u2019 populations, of which the Northwest Atlantic population near Newfoundland, Canada is the largest. The Northwest population is genetically different from the two others which are not proved genetically different from each other. All 3 populations are hunted commercially, mainly by Canada, Norway, Russia and Greenland. Harp seals are also hunted by killer whales (orcas) and polar bears. The fossil remains of Harp seals indicate they existed during the middle Miocene age, approximately 20 million years ago. Harp Seals apparently originated in the northern hemisphere and are derived from a stock of land-based flesh-eating mammals.",
            "characteristics": "Harp seals owe their name to the irregular horseshoe-shaped band of black straddling the back in the adult male. This band, or \u2018harp\u2019, unites across the shoulders, curves down toward the abdominal region and the back up toward the posterior flippers where it abruptly disappears. The background color of the pelt is steel blue when wet and pale grey when dry.The head and tail of the Harp seal are black, while the anterior flippers and belly are whitish. Adult females are similarly patterned, except that the \u2018harp\u2019, the head and the tail are usually somewhat lighter in color. Some adult females have irregular dark grey spots on the back with no clearly defined \u2018harp\u2019. Occasionally very dark \u2018smutty\u2019 seals are observed; these are generally males and are thought to be melanistic (darkly pigmented) color forms.Male Harp Seals are only slightly larger than females, the average length (from the nose to the tip of the tail) of adult males is 169 centimetres and of adult females 162 centimetres. Weight ranges from 85 to 18 kilograms depending on time of year.",
            "habitat and diet": "The Harp Seal spends most of its life in the sea, however, it also goes onto ice floes. Harp Seals are carnivores (meat-eaters). Harp Seals eat mostly fish and crustaceans. Seals do not chew their food, they swallow it in large chunks. They can crush the shells of crustaceans with their flat back teeth.",
            "behaviour": "During spring, harp seals migrate north following the receding pack ice. Through their summer residence in the Arctic, harp seals reach as far north as Jones and Lancaster Sounds in the Canadian Arctic and Thule in northwestern Greenland. To reach these northern waters, harp seals must swim more than 3 200 kilometres. Small numbers also move westward into Hudson Bay, reaching Southampton Island and occasionally as far south as the Belcher Islands near James Bay. The southward migration begins just ahead of the formation of new Arctic ice and involves all adults and most juveniles. Some immature seals spend much of the winter in the Arctic, as tagged seals have been recorded at West Greenland in all months.",
            "reproduction": "Each year, mature females (5 \u2013 6 years old) give birth to a single pup, typically in late February. Pups weigh approximately 10 kilograms and are 80 \u2013 85 centimetres long. Immediately after giving birth, the mother seal smells her offspring, and from that point on will only ever feed her own pup, whose scent she remembers. Harp Seal milk contains up to 50% fat, so pups gain over 2 kilograms per day when nursing, which lasts roughly 12 days. During this time the mother does not eat, and will lose up to 3 kilograms per day of body weight.Weaning is very abrupt. The mother simply leaves and never returns. The stranded pup will cry at first and then become very sedentary to conserve body fat. Pups are unable to swim or find food until they are about 25 days old, leaving them very vulnerable to Polar Bears and humans during this time.As mother Harp Seals wean their young, mature males (6 \u2013 7 years old) roam around breeding with the females promiscuously. Courtship begins on the ice, however the actual mating takes place in the water. Harp Seals have delayed implantation, meaning the fertilized egg becomes an embryo, but does not implant in the uterus right away. The embryo will float around for about three and a half months before implanting and beginning to grow. This allows all the females to give birth within a very small time period each year, when the ice pack is available for giving birth and raising their young. Harp seals may live 35 years or more.",
            "conservation status": "Harp seals are not considered to be threatened, although many are killed annually by hunters for fur. The population is estimated to be over two million."

Their forehead is grey with streaks of black. The tip of the beak is black. The throat and chest are white. There are dark grey patches running from the flippers to the eyes. The belly is also white with a stripe running up the sides from under the dorsal fin. The bulk of the back and sides is the same lighter grey of the beak. The tail stock is narrow.At birth, the Hector\u2019s dolphin weighs about 9 kilograms and grows to about 40 to 60 kilograms at adulthood. At about 1.4 metres in length, it is one of the smallest cetaceans. The Hector\u2019s dolphins have a life span of about 20 years.",

Hector\u2019s dolphins are active animals, readily bow-riding and playing with seaweed. When leaping from the sea, individuals will often land on their side, creating a loud splash (their vertical and horizontal dives are much less noisy).Hector\u2019s dolphins tend to stay in the same area \u2013 sometimes for life.

Related and similar species are also found as far as north Africa, the Middle East and central Asia. There are 16 species of hedgehog in five genera, found through parts of Europe, Asia, Africa and New Zealand. There are no hedgehogs native to Australia and no living species native to North America. Those in New Zealand are introduced. The pre-breeding season population estimate of Hedgehogs in Britain is around 1,555,000. Many die from eating poisoned slugs.",
            "description": "Hedgehogs are easily recognized by their spines, which are hollow hairs made stiff with keratin. Their spines are not poisonous or barbed and unlike the quills of a porcupine, cannot easily be removed from the animal.However, spines normally come out when a hedgehog sheds baby spines and replaces them with adult spines. This is called \u2018quilling\u2019.When under extreme stress or during sickness, a hedgehog can also lose its spines. Their under-parts are covered by coarse grey-brown fur, forming long skirts along flanks. A hedgehog measures around 23 centimetres in length and has a 4 centimetre tail. They can weigh up to 2 kilograms. The Hedgehog has a powerful forefoot and claws for digging.Hedgehogs have 5 toes on their front paws with short nails. However, on their back paws they have 4 toes with long, constantly growing nails. They have these characteristics because hedgehogs burrow. They can also climb, swim and can sprint a surprisingly fast 6 miles per hour.",
            "habitats": "Hedgehogs build nests of moss and leaves under vegetation around parks, gardens and farmland. They prefer woodland edges, hedgerows and suburban gardens where food is plentiful.",
            "diet": "Hedgehogs are not exclusively insectivores but are almost omnivorous. Hedgehogs feed on insects, snails, frogs and toads, caterpillars, worms, beetles, snakes, bird eggs, carrion, mushrooms, grass roots, berries, melons and watermelons. Its favourite food is slugs and worms, they may eat 40 or more slugs a night.",
            "behaviour": "Hedgehogs have changed little over the last 15 million years. Like many of the first mammals they have adapted to a nocturnal way of life.The male Hedgehog is called a \u2018Boar\u2019 and is slightly larger than a female Hedgehog which is called a \u2018Sow\u2019.Hedgehogs hibernate alone from November to April under a supporting structure such as a shed, wood piles, brambles, open compost bags or bonfire heaps. They may, however, emerge to forage at night during warm winter spells. In summer, hedgehogs shelter during the day in temporary nests of leaves, moss and grass. By autumn, hedgehogs have dramatically put on weight in preparation for their hibernation.They hibernate until the following March or April, during which time their body temperature and heart beat fall dramatically, from 190 to about 20 beats per minute. Most hedgehog deaths occur during this hibernation period.If threatened, a hedgehog can roll up into a ball as protection against predators. Their biggest enemy apart from man is the badger. The roll causes all spines to point outwards. However, its effectiveness depends on the number of spines and since some of the desert hedgehogs evolved to carry less weight, they are much more likely to try to run away and sometimes even attack the intruder, trying to ram into the intruder with its spines, leaving rolling as a last resort.This results in a different number of predators for different species. Smaller species like the Long-eared Hedgehog are preyed on by foxes, wolves and mongooses.All hedgehogs are primarily nocturnal, although different species can be more or less likely to come out in the daytime. The hedgehog sleeps for a large portion of the daytime either under cover of bush, grass, rock or in a hole in the ground. Again, different species can have slightly different habits, however, in general, hedgehogs dig out dens for shelter. All wild hedgehogs can hibernate, although not all do. Hibernation depends on temperature, species and abundance of food.Hedgehogs occasionally perform a ritual called \u2018anointing\u2019. When the animal comes across a new scent, it will lick and bite the source and then form a scented froth in its mouth and paste it on its spines with its tongue. It is not known what the specific purpose of this ritual is, however, some experts believe anointing camouflages the hedgehog with the new scent of the area and provides a possible poison or source of infection to any predator that gets poked by their spines. Anointing is sometimes also called \u2018anting\u2019 because of a similar behaviour in birds.Hedgehogs are a powerful form of pest control. A single hedgehog can keep an average garden free of pests by eating up to 200 grams of insects each night. It is common throughout the United Kingdom to see people attempting to lure hedgehogs into their gardens with treats and hedgehog-sized holes in their fences.",
            "reproduction": "The hedgehogs dilemma is based upon the apparent danger of a male hedgehog being injured from a spine while mating with a female hedgehog. However, this is not an issue for hedgehogs as the males penis is very near the centre of its abdomen (often mistaken for a belly button) and the female has the ability to curl her tail upward to the point that her vulva protrudes behind the rest of her body. As such, the male does not have to get completely on top of the female when mating.Depending on the species, the gestation period is 35 \u2013 58 days. The average litter is 4 \u2013 7 newborns for larger species of hedgehog and 5 \u2013 6 for smaller ones. The pale-colored soft spines appear hours after birth and take 3 weeks to harden. Hedgehogs are born blind. Many believe that they are born without quills, which develop in the following days. However, the quills are easily visible within hours of birth after the newborn hedgehog has been cleaned. Young Hedgehogs become independent of mother at 4 \u2013 6 weeks. As with many animals, it is not unusual for an adult male hedgehog to kill newborn males.Hedgehogs have a relatively long life span for their size. Larger species of hedgehogs live 4 \u2013 7 years in the wild (some have been recorded up to 16 years), and smaller species live 2 \u2013 4 years (4 \u2013 7 in captivity), compared to a mouse at 2 years and a large rat at 3 \u2013 5 years. Lack of predators and controlled diet contribute to a longer life span in captivity.",
            "conservation status": "Hedgehogs are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act in Britain and may not be trapped without a licence. They are not considered to be endangered, although numbers are in decline due to habitat loss.Hedgehogs are often killed by manmade influences, such as in ponds, bonfires, on roads, by strimmers and lawnmowers, pesticides, garden netting and litter. They are also killed by foxes, pine martens, stoats and badgers.Provide a home for Hedgehogs",
            "choosing a hedgehog house": "You can make a hedgehog house very simply. Covering a sturdy upturned crate with stones, earth or wood may be enough to encourage habitation. Leave a way for the hedgehogs to get in and out. You can also make or buy specially designed wooden hedgehog boxes. Check that the wood you use or buy is from a sustainable source.Make sure that your hedgehog box is sturdy, as both badgers and foxes prey on hedgehogs. Of course, the easiest way to house a hedgehog does not involve much effort on your part at all. Help them make their own homes by creating hedgehog-friendly sites around the garden. Accessible space under a shed or hedge, log piles and compost heaps are all favourites.",
            "positioning your hedgehog house": "Site the house in a quiet area of the garden, against a wall, bank or fence if possible and under or near plant cover. Make sure that the entrance is not facing north or north-east for a higher chance of habitation.Do not line the box. A Hedgehog makes their own nests out of leaves and other garden debris. Do not disturb the box once it is occupied, as you may frighten a nesting mother and cause the young to be abandoned. Like slugs and snails, hedgehogs are often found in damp, grassy areas of the garden. If you have, or can create, an untidy area near your nest box site, hedgehogs will be able to forage more easily and with protective cover.",
            "hazards": "Always check compost heaps and piles of firewood for hedgehogs before disturbing them, as they may well nest in these. Fruit nets and mesh can be dangerous for hedgehogs (and other animals) which may get caught in them.Lawn mowers and strimmers can be fatal. Be especially careful when cutting longer grass. Avoid using slug pellets and other garden chemicals. These can harm hedgehogs. It is better to encourage hedgehogs to keep these pests under control. As hedgehogs have a fairly large territory, they may use a number of different gardens to search for food, if you want to encourage them they will need to be able to get into and out of yours."

            "desc": "Hermit crabs are decapod crustaceans of the superfamily Paguroidea, not closely related to true crabs. Most hermit crabs salvage empty seashells to shelter and protect their soft abdomens, from which they derive the name \u2018hermit\u2019. There are about five hundred known species of hermit crabs in the world, most of which are aquatic. Hermit crabs live at a range of depths from shallow coral reefs and shorelines to deep bottoms, although some species are terrestrial.",
            "hermit crab characteristics": "As hermit crabs grow, they must exchange their shell for a larger one. Hermit crabs have a hard exoskeleton that protects all of the body except the abdomen. The reason they seek out shells is because their abdomen is very soft and vulnerable to predators. There is frequently strong competition with hermit crabs fighting over available abandoned shells.A hermit crab with a shell which is too small can not grow as fast as hermit crabs will well-fitting shells and is more likely to be eaten.Terrestrial hermit crabs begin their lives in the sea but, through a series of molts, develop the ability to breathe air. After the last developmental molt, the young hermit crab will drown if left in water for an indefinite period of time. Their link with the sea is never entirely broken, however, as hermit crabs carry a small amount of water in their shells at all times to keep their abdomen moist and their modified gills hydrated.For some larger marine hermit crab species, having one or more sea anemones (a group of water dwelling, predatory animals of the order Actiniaria) growing on the shell can be very useful, because the anemones tend to scare away fish and other marine predators which might otherwise attack the crab. The sea anemone also benefits because it is well-positioned to consume loose fragments of the hermit crabs meals. Because of this mutualism (a biological interaction between individuals of two different species), sea anemones can be, and sometimes are, transferred to a new shell when the hermit crab changes shells.",
            "hermit crab reproduction": "In some hermit crabs, fertilization occurs internally, while in others, fertilization is external and occurs at the moment of egg-laying. The developing eggs are attached to the abdominal swimmerets present only in the females. A female is able to carry several thousand eggs into the water.The newly hatched hermit crabs are known as larvae. These young crabs live as microscopic plankton for several weeks before settling on the bottom and searching for a shell to inhabit."

Some species are solitary nesters, although most are colonial nesters and colonies can contain several species, as well as other species of waterbirds.Males usually arrive at a nest site first and begin building a nest, which they then display to attract females. The nests of herons are usually found near or above water, particularly in trees. Although the nests of a few species have been found on the ground where suitable trees or shrubs are unavailable, they are typically placed in vegetation.Males display with visual cues such as ruffling their plumage and flying around. Once the female has chosen an appropriate mate, the pair produces between three and seven eggs. The incubation period lasts several weeks and, once hatched, both parents care for the young and share incubation and feeding duties.It can take between two and three months for chicks grow their full flight feathers and become more independent.\u00a0Heron Location and HabitatHerons are a cosmopolitan species that have worldwide distribution. They are found on all continents except Antarctica and are present in most habitats except the coldest extremes of the Arctic, extremely high mountains, and the driest deserts.They reside near water sources such as lakes, rivers, swamps, ponds, and the sea and are classed as non-swimming waterbirds. They construct a large platform of sticks in bushes, cliffs, or trees. These nests are part of larger colonies called heronries or rookeries.Herons are pretty nomadic birds that move from place to place. Most species are at least partially migratory. Southern populations reside in a similar place all year round, while the northernmost populations tend to move south for the winter where the water will not freeze over and prevent them from feeding. The distance in which they will travel will vary, though.Heron Conservation StatusHerons are widespread throughout their areas, and are actually some of the most common waterbirds around the world. They are currently listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.Despite this, a few species, such as the white-bellied heron of the Himalayas and the Madagascar pond heron, are endangered or critically endangered and a few species have become extinct in recent times.These birds are mostly threatened by the loss of their habitat, due to humans and climate change.

A male hippopotamus is called a \u2018bull\u2019, a female hippopotamus is called a \u2018cow\u2019 and a baby hippopotamus is called a \u2018calf\u2019. The hippopotamus is a large, mostly plant-eating African mammal, one of only two extant, and three or four recently extinct, species in the family \u2018Hippopotamidae\u2019. The hippopotamus has an average life span of about 45 years in the wild and 50 years in captivity.",
            "characteristics": "Hippos average 3.5 metres (11 feet) in length, 1.5 metres (5 feet) tall at the shoulder and weigh from 1500 kilograms to 3200 kilograms (3,300 to 7,000 pounds). Hippos are approximately the same size as the White Rhinoceros and experts often debate on which is the next largest land animal after the elephant. Male hippos appear to continue growing throughout their lives, whereas the female hippos reach a maximum weight at around the age of 25 years.Female hippos are smaller than their male counterparts and normally weigh no more than 1500 kilograms. The value given above of 3200 kilogramsis often quoted as being the upper limit of weight for a male hippo.However, larger specimens than this have been documented, including one hippopotamus which weighed about 10,000 pounds (4,500 kilograms) and measured around 16 feet (5 metres) in length.Even though they are bulky animals, hippopotamuses can run faster than a human on land. There are estimates of their running speed varying from 30 kilometres per hour (18 miles per hour) to 40 kilometres per hour (25 miles per hour), or even 50 kilometres per hour (30 miles per hour). The hippo can maintain these higher estimates for only a few hundred metres or yards.Despite the hippos physical resemblance to pigs and other terrestrial even-toed ungulates, their closest living relatives are cetaceans including whales and porpoises.Hippopotamuses have legs that are small, relative to other megafauna (groups of large animals), because the water in which they live reduces the weight burden. Like other aquatic mammals, the hippopotamus has very little hair.\u00a0",
            "behaviour": "Hippos are highly territorial mammals. A male hippo often marks his territory along a riverbank from which to draw in a harem of female hippos, while defending it against other male hippos. Male hippos challenge one another with threatening gapes. Their canine teeth are 50 centimetres (20 inches) long and they use their heads as battering rams, especially against rival males while fighting over territory.Since their habitat is often encroached upon by farmers and tourists and because they are so territorial, the hippopotamus is the most dangerous animal in Africa. Hippopotamuses kill crocodiles and lions and are even responsible for more human deaths than any other African animal. The hippo does not hunt humans, however, it defends its own territory vigorously. Approach hippos with care, or do not approach them at all.Five subspecies of hippos have been described based on morphological differences in their skulls and geographical differences.H. a. amphibius (the nominate subspecies) which stretched from Egypt, where they are now extinct down the Nile River to Tanzania and Mozambique.H. a. kiboko in the Horn of Africa, in Kenya and Somalia. Kiboko is the Swahili word for hippo. They have broader nasals and more hollowed interorbital region.H. a. capensis from Zambia to South Africa. Most flattened skull of the subspecies.H. a. tschadensis throughout Western Africa to, as the name suggests, Chad. Slightly shorter and wider face, with prominent orbits.H. a. constrictus in Angola, the southern Democratic Republic of Congo and Namibia. Named for its deeper preorbital constrictionli.\u00a0"

            "desc": "The Hobo Spider (Tegenaria agrestis) is a member of the genus of spiders known as funnel web spiders. The Hobo Spider is one of a small number of spiders in North America whose bites are generally considered to be medically significant. ",
            "characteristics": "The female Hobo Spider reaches sizes of 11 \u2013 15 millimetres. The male Hobo Spider measures 8 \u2013 11 millimetres. There is no dimorphism (difference in form between individuals of different sex in the same species) in color or markings. The Hobo Spiders coloration is rather subdued, being a mixture of brown and rust earth shades. Hobo Spiders have a herringbone pattern on the top side of their abdomens.Although most Hobo Spiders have very hairy-looking legs, the legs of this spider are fairly smooth. Similar spiders have stripes on the legs and are often much larger. The Hobo Spider has solid light-brown colored legs. Related species are quite similar in appearance and it requires technical training to identify them reliably.",
            "habitat and spider webs": "The Hobo Spider prefers moderately dry and warm environments, however, in Europe, it does not typically live in houses, largely due to competition from house spiders such as the Giant house spider (Tegenaria gigantea). The Hobo Spider is most commonly found in gardens, fields, hedges and similar places.The Hobo Spider is quite rarely found in houses in Europe, where almost no envenoms have been reported and the harmless if similar-looking Barn funnel weaver spider (T. domestica) is far more common. Hobo spiders sometimes build their webs in or around human habitations.The Hobo spider creates a non-sticky trip web that does not permanently stick insects to it. Instead, once the prey trips on the web the hobo spider attacks the prey before it can get away. This along with its poor eye site explains why they are noticeably more aggressive to humans then other spiders. Hobo Spiders have to attack to eat otherwise they would die of starvation. The webs they make are funnel shaped and are often attached to an object in the garden, by the foundation, between planters, or anything that remains stationary near the ground level. The Hobo spider also makes webs under homes and attach it to plants or weeds.",
            "diet": "Hobo spiders construct a funnel-shaped structure of silk sheeting and lie in wait at the small end of the funnel for prey insects to blunder onto their webs.",
            "reproduction": "The Hobo spider typically enters homes when it is in search of a mate. Male Hobo spiders tend to wander with this yearning around August time. He will generally be eaten after mating has been completed. The female Hobo spider produces several white to cream egg sacs, suspending them within her tangled web. The female Hobo spider can live for about two years, whereas the male will only live for a few months.",
            "venom": "Most bites from the Hobo spider occur when the spider is accidentally crushed or squeezed by a human. The spiders venom is strong enough to cause considerable local pain and has been reported to sometimes cause tissue death (necrosis) at and near the bite.While the effects of Hobo spider bites can go so far as to include necrosis, they are not known to be fatal to healthy humans. The necrosis in the reported cases is similar to, however, less serious than the necrosis caused by the brown recluse spider. If such a lesion is severe it may take months to heal. Other reported symptoms include intense headaches that may last from a couple of days to a week and in some cases there were vision abnormalities or a general feeling of malaise (a feeling of general discomfort or uneasiness).If a hobo spider is tending an egg sac, it may become aggressive if it perceives the egg sac to be threatened. However, they generally do not bite unless forced to protect themselves and in the majority of cases the hobo spider does not actually inject venom when it does bite."

        "Honey Bee": {
            "image": "https://animalcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/honey-bee-1-340x200.jpg",
            "desc": "Honey bees are social insects. Their colonies includes a queen, drones and workers. Honey bees have been producing honey for over 100 million years. Honeybees, also spelt honey bees, are flying insects known as a eusocial insects, meaning they are one of the most socially organized animals on the planet. Known for their distinct black and yellow color and their ability to produce honey, honeybees are very important to our environment and are perfectly adapted to help with pollination. You might think there\u2019s not much more to learn about bees other than about honey and pollination, but that is not true. Honey bees are fascinating, and if you\u2019re ready to find out more about them, keep reading on!",
            "reproduction": "A queen is the only reproductive female in a hive, with the rest of the female workers being sterile. The queen\u2019s job is to reproduce, and she lays eggs nearly continuously throughout the year, sometimes up to 1,000 eggs/day.The queen is able to control whether or not an egg they lay is fertilized. Unfertilized eggs develop as males, while fertilized eggs develop as workers or new queens, depending on how they are fed as larvae.A queen will often mate with many drones, a mating behaviour known as polyandry. Polyandry increases genetic diversity within a colony and thereby improves colony fitness and survival.Drones also serve only one purpose: to mate with virgin queens. Soon after mating, drones die.Colonies of honeybees reproduce by swarming. The workers produce queen larvae and, before a new queen emerges, the old queen takes half of the colony with her, in a swarm, to build a new colony. We will go into more detail about swarming later on.",
            "pollination": "Honeybees have been major pollinators of flowers for millions of years. The bees help flowers to reproduce by transferring pollen from one flower to another. Without this, many flowers wouldn\u2019t be able to procreate and eventually would die out.Humans benefit from pollination too, as it helps us to keep our gardens looking nice and also helps us to grow vegetables. Honey bees also extract nectar along with the pollen from the flowers, which is then turned into honey. We will explore this further on.",
            "swarming": "Honeybees are the only type of bees that swarm. A bee swarm occurs when a hive becomes overcrowded or overpopulated, and some of the bees leave the hive with the old queen, while a new queen takes over. Because they have left their hive, they stay in a swarm while they scout for their new home.Bees swarm in many different places. These include in tree branches or in public trash cans. Bee swarms are often found less than 100 metres away from a beehive. Usually, they stay in this location from a few minutes to a few days before they find a more permanent place.A bee swarm can vary in size, anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands of bees. Swarming can occur at any time from March to September, but swarming season usually occurs during the first periods of really warm weather in late April through to June, so spring to early summer. Each time a swarm is created, it usually consists of approximately 50% of the bee colony. It typically consists of one queen bee, less than 50 drones (male bees) and thousands of worker bees.A bee swarm is very important because it helps with the reproduction of a honeybee colony. It is also essential to the bees\u2019 survival. If the hive becomes overcrowded, resources will be scarce and the colony\u2019s health will begin to decline.",
            "communication": "Honeybees are well known for the way in which they communicate with each other. Communication is based on chemical signals, particularly scent and taste, and each hive has a unique chemical signal that those in the hive use to identify each other.The bees are always communicating with each other, most of which is done through the worker bees. The workers feed and groom each other, as well as larvae, drones, and the queen. In this process they pass on pheromones, chemical signals that indicate information about the health of the queen and the state of the colony.Honeybees also use the same chemicals to help with their foraging, particularly their scent which can be used to detect certain flowers from a distance. The chemicals are used when a worker stings something, too. When she stings, her stinger releases an alarm pheromone that causes other bees to become agitated, and helps them locate the enemy. Workers and queens can also hear vibrations, which allows new queens to communicate with each other.The most notable form of communication between honey bees is their \u201cdancing\u201d, When workers have located a good food supply, their wiggle their bodies to indicate the direction and distance of the food. The same dance is done by bees that return from scouting a new hive location after a swarm has left the original hive. Through their dance, they are able to show other scout bees the direction and distance from this potential new location.There are two main types of honey bee dances: round dance and waggle dance. Round dance is a movement in a circle and is used to indicate the food source is less than 50 meters from the nest. Waggle dance is a figure eight pattern while the bee waggles its abdomen and is used for food located at a distance of more than 150 meters.\u00a0HabitatAs we mentioned above, honeybees can be found all over the world. They are usually found in areas that have an abundant supply of flowering plants, but can also survive in grasslands, deserts, and wetlands if there is sufficient water, food, and shelter.Honey bees need a cavity to nest in, such as a hollow tree. This is where they build their hive, which is where they live. When a hive becomes too overcrowded, the queen will take off with around half of the colony and build a new honeybee hive. This is why you see bee swarms and they help with reproduction of bee colonies.A hive is a series of combs made of wax produced and secreted by the workers. Honey and plant nectar is stored in the cells of honeycomb. Workers guard the entrance of the hive. They are able to recognize members of their colony by scent, and will attack any non-members that try to enter the hive.\u00a0Importance Of Honey BeesHoneybees are extremely important for our environment. Without them, many flowers would have trouble reproducing, as bees help with pollination and transferring the pollen from one flower to another. Thanks to their dancing, worker honeybees can also convince other workers to visit certain flowers for the pollen, which then leads to more pollination of that plant.The bees also produce honey, beeswax and royal jelly, all of which are either eaten by humans or used in cosmetics and medicine. Honey bees store honey in their honeycombs, and it is collected from wild bee colonies, or from hives of domesticated bees, a practice known as beekeeping or apiculture. Honey is sweet because of the monosaccharides fructose and glucose.Honey is laid down by bees as a food source. In cold weather or when food sources are scarce, bees use their stored honey as their source of energy.In beekeeping, the beekeeper encourages honey production within the hive so that the excess can be taken without endangering the bees. When sources of foods for the bees are short, the beekeeper may have to give the bees supplementary nutrition.\u00a0ConservationIt is thought that widespread commercialization of beekeeping is endangering local populations. While honeybees are not considered an endangered species, there are honeybee conservation organizations out there.\u00a0",
            "extra facts about honeybees": "Honeybee workers will sting humans and domesticated animals in defense of themselves or their hive.A bee sting is painful but isn\u2019t actually dangerous, unless the recipient is allergic to the venom. It would take about 20 stings per kilogram of body weight to be life threatening.Honey bees are organisms that are studied for research in the connections between nervous system structure and behavior.Honeybees are hosts to a variety of parasites, commensal organisms, and pathogenic microbes.Worker bees die after stinging, but the sting is painful enough to discourage the predator from attacking other bees or the hive.Some known predators of honeybees include bears, beewolves, crab spiders, honey badgers, skunks and toads.\u00a0"

Apart from their size, Hornets are easily identified by their brown and orangy-yellow markings, as opposed to the normal black and yellow of other wasps. Hornets are quite rare in the British Isles. They are usually found in the dense wooded areas in the South of England. Like common wasps, hornets build their nests out of paper in hollow trees, chimneys, wall cavities and sheds etc. ",
            "hornet lifecycle": "The hornets nest is founded in spring by a fertilized female Hornet, known as the queen. She generally selects sheltered places like hollow tree trunks. She builds a first series of cells (up to 50) out of chewed tree bark. The cells are arranged in horizontal layers named combs, each cell being vertical and closed at the top.An egg is then laid in each cell. After 5 \u2013 8 days it hatches and in the next two weeks the larva undergoes its five stages. During this time the queen feeds it a protein-rich diet of insects. Then the larva spins a silk cap over the cells opening, and during the next two weeks transforms into an adult, a process called metamorphosis. Then the adult hornet eats her way through the silk cap.This first generation of workers, invariably female hornets, will now gradually undertake all the tasks that were formerly carried out by the queen (foraging, nest building, taking care of the brood, etc) with one exception: egg-laying, which remains done exclusively by the queen.As the colony size grows, new combs are added, and an envelope is built around the cell layers, until the nest is entirely covered, with the exception of an entry hole. At the peak of its population the colony can reach a size of 700 workers. This occurs in late summer.At this time the queen hornet begins producing the first reproductive individuals. Fertilized eggs develop into females (called gynes by entomologists), unfertilized ones into males (called drones). Adult drones do not participate in nest maintenance, foraging, or caretaking of the larvae. In early to mid-autumn they leave the nest and mate during mating flights. The drones die shortly after the flights. The workers and queens survive at most until mid to late autumn; only the fertilized queens survive over winter.Hornets often live together with Velleius dilatatus (the Rove Beetle)."

The carapace is the smooth frontmost part of the crab which contains the eyes, the walking legs, the chelicera (pincers), the mouth, the brain and the heart. The abdomen is the middle portion where the gills are attached as well as the genital operculum. The last section is the \u2018telson\u2019 (caudal spine) which is used to flip itself over if stuck upside down.",
            "horseshoe crab life span and reproduction": "Horseshoe crabs can live for 20 \u2013 25 years. Horseshoe crabs migrate into the shore in late spring, with the males arriving first. The females then arrive and make nests at a depth of 15 \u2013 20 centimetres in the sand. Females deposit eggs into the nests which are subsequently fertilized by the male. Egg quantity is dependent on female body size and ranges from 15,000 \u2013 64,000 eggs per female.After the eggs split, the larvae form and then swim for about 5 to 7 days. After swimming they settle and begin the first molt. This occurs approximately 20 days after the formation of the egg capsule. As young horseshoe crabs grow, they move to deeper waters, where molting continues. Horseshoe crabs reach sexual maturity in approximately 11 years and may live another 10 \u2013 14 years beyond that.\u00a0"

            "habitats": "Outdoors, house centipedes prefer to live in cool, damp places. Most live outside, primarily under large rocks, piles of wood and especially in compost piles.Within the home, these centipedes are found in almost any part of the house, most commonly, they are encountered in basements, bathrooms and lavatories, where there is a lot more water, but they can also be found in dry places like offices, bedrooms and dining rooms.The greatest likelihood of encountering them is in spring, when they come out because the weather gets warmer and also in Autumn, when the cooling weather forces them to find shelter in human habitats.",
            "centipedes and humans": "Unlike its shorter-legged but much larger tropical cousins, the house centipede can live its entire life inside a building.Because they eat household pests, house centipedes are considered among the most beneficial creatures that inhabit human dwellings, but because of their alarming, frightening appearance and painful bite, few homeowners are willing to share a home with them. They do not cause damage to food or furniture.The house centipede is capable of biting a human, but this seldom occurs. When it does, it is no worse than a minor bee sting. The worst one can usually expect from a house centipedes bite is some pain and a slight swelling at the location of the bite. The symptoms generally disappear within a few hours. However, the bite can cause health problems for those few who are allergic to the extremely mild venom of its bite, which is similar to that of most normal centipedes.The house centipedes venom is too weak to cause any serious harm to larger pets such as cats and dogs.\u00a0"

It is the southernmost member of the Alouatta genus. The Black Howler Monkey lives in groups of 3 to 19 individuals (usually 7 to 9). There are usually 1 \u2013 3 males for every 7 \u2013 9 females in a group. When mating, males and females within a single group pair off.Named for their vocalizations, the Black Howler Monkey may be heard most often around sunrise. This \u2018dawn chorus\u2019 sounds much more like roaring than howling and it announces the howlers position as a means to avoiding conflict with other groups. The Black Howler Monkeys call can be heard up to 5 kilometres away.Black Howler Monkeys commonly sleep or rest up to 80% of the day, making it one of the least active monkeys in the New World. Their habitat is forest where they eat mostly leaves, however, it will also eat the occasional fruit, such as figs.Black Howler Monkeys generally prefer walking and climbing to running or leaping. The prehensile tail is very strong and acts as a fifth limb, allowing the monkeys greater versatility when climbing and allowing them greater safety in the occasional fall from a high branch. Because their limb structure makes terrestrial movement awkward, they spend most of their time in the trees and only come down for water during dry spells. Otherwise the monkeys drink by wetting their hand on a moist leaf and then licking the water of their hand.The Black Howler Monkeys life span is up to 20 years, however, more commonly 15 years in the wild. The Black Howler Monkey is also found in the rainforests of Guyana.Gestation lasts roughly 6 months and one young is born, which is carried underneath the mother. The young are weaned at around 1 and a half years of age and live to approximately 20 years of age. Several females will help to look after a single baby (called allomothering), carrying, grooming and protecting it, and even the males will help too, although young males are not allowed to do so, as they can sometimes harm the infant.",

They have a fleshy-pink base to their beaks. Juveniles have dark heads and no breast-band.",
            "diet": "Humboldt penguins feed on fish, especially anchovies, herring and smelt.",
            "behaviour": "Humboldt penguins are social animals, living in relatively large colonies, where communication is important. Colonies are beneficial because they provide collective defence against predators.Unlike Antarctic penguins that huddle together in large groups to stay warm, Humboldt penguins have no need to do this because of the warm, temperate climate in which they live. Instead, to warm up or cool down, Humboldt penguins seek the security and comfort of their nesting burrows. Humboldt penguins, like all penguins, are monogamous.Mated penguins can recognize one another through vocal and visual mechanisms within the colony. Parents and offspring can also recognize each other easily using sight and sound. Each penguin has a unique voice which allows its mate and offspring to recognize it.Humboldt penguins have a body made to swim. Using their strong wings, they \u2018fly\u2019 underwater, usually just below the surface, at speeds of up to 20 miles per hour (32 kilometres per hour). Humboldt Penguins steer with their feet and tail. Their feathers are stiff and overlap to waterproof and insulate their body. Dense feathers also protect the penguin in winds of up to 60 miles per hour (96 kilometres per hour). Humboldt penguins, like all penguins, can see easily underwater and on land. Also, these birds have a supraorbital gland which enables them to drink salt water in addition to fresh water. The gland withdraws excess salt from the penguins blood and excretes it in a concentrated solution which dribbles down the beak. In zoos, Humboldt penguins usually live in fresh water and as a result the gland is dormant. Living only in fresh water does not affect the penguins health.",
            "reproduction": "Humboldt penguins can breed at any time of the year. Sexual maturity is reached between 2 and 7 years old. Nests are made in caves, cracks or holes and occasionally in more open sites such as rocky shore.Humboldt penguins usually dig burrow-like nests among piles of guano (accumulated droppings of sea birds) which forms in caves and along cliffs. Females lay one or two eggs and the incubation period is approximately 40 days. Both parents take turns incubating the eggs. At times, only one chick survives because hatching is staggered and one chick may be smaller than another. When food is scarce the parents feed only the larger chick and the smaller chick quickly starves.Chick care begins with parents alternating jobs of sitting with the chick and hunting for food. After about two months, the chick is left alone during the day while both parents hunt for food. Chicks are born with greyish brown, downy feathers then molt into completely grey feathers when they fledge. Humboldt penguin chicks fledge at about 70 \u2013 90 days.Approximately one year after chicks fledge, they molt into adult feathers. Adult penguins have a white front and a brownish-black back and head. They also have a dark stripe across the chest and a white mark circling above each eye and forward around the neck.Humboldt Penguins life span is around 20 years.",
            "predators": "In addition to natural predators, such as gulls, vultures, caracaras, foxes, pinipeds and cetaceans, Humboldt penguins also face a number of man-made hazards. Commercial fishing reduces breeding success and survival rates through depletion of food resources. Over-fishing of the Peruvian Anchovy (Engraulis ringens) led to its population collapse in the 1970s. This fish was a major component of the Humboldt penguins diet and penguin populations suffered as a result.Hundreds of Humboldt penguins are also caught and drowned in the nets of local fishermen every year. Accidental entanglement in gill-nets and the deliberate hunting of adults for food and fishing bait, are the main causes of adult mortality in some areas. Eggs are also taken from many breeding colonies, resulting in disturbance and reduced breeding success.",
            "conservation": "The current status of the Humboldt Penguin is vulnerable, due to a declining population caused in part by over-fishing. Historically it was the victim of guano over-exploitation. The current population is estimated at between 3,300 and 12,000."

            "characteristics": "Huntsman Spiders are large, long-legged spiders, measuring up to 15 centimetres across the legs. Huntsman Spiders are mostly grey to brown, sometimes with banded legs. Huntsman Spiders have eight eyes.Many Huntsman Spiders, especially Flat Huntsman Spiders and including Common Huntsman spiders and Banded Huntsman Spiders, have rather flattened bodies adapted for living in narrow spaces under loose bark or rock crevices.This is aided by their legs which, instead of bending vertically in relation to the body, have the joints twisted so that they spread out forwards and laterally in crab-like fashion. Both Brown Huntsman Spiders (Heteropoda) and Badge Huntsman Spiders (Neosparassus) have less flattened bodies.The eyesight of the Huntsman Spider is not nearly as good as that of the Jumping Spiders (Salticidae). However, their vision is quite sufficient to detect approaching humans or other large animals from some distance.The Banded Huntsman Spider (Holconia) is large and grey to brown with striped bands on its legs. The Badge Huntsman (Neosparassus) is larger still and brown and hairy. Its bite will inflict the worst injury and local swelling and pain may cause nausea, headache, vomiting and heart palpitations. The Tropical or Brown Huntsman (Heteropoda) is also large and hairy, with mottled brown, white and black markings.\u00a0",
            "habitat and spider webs": "Huntsman Spiders are found in Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, the Mediterranean, Florida and Hawaii and possibly in many other tropical and semi-tropical regions. Adult Huntsman spiders do not build webs, however, they hunt and forage for food.Huntsman Spiders are found living under loose bark on trees, in crevices on rock walls and in logs, under rocks and slabs of bark on the ground and on foliage. Dozens of the social huntsman species, (Delena cancerides), can be seen sitting together under bark on dead trees and stumps, however, they can also be found on the ground under rocks and bark slabs.Badge Huntsman Spiders are often found on foliage, however, some woodland species are burrow builders, with and without trapdoors. Huntsman spiders of many species sometimes enter houses. Huntsman Spiders are also notorious for entering cars and being found hiding behind sun visors or running across the dashboard.\u00a0",

            "reproduction": "Males of Heteropoda venatoria, one of the Huntsman spiders, have recently been found to deliberately make a sound when they are given reason to believe that females of their species are nearby. These spiders have a lengthy courtship and the male is rarely attacked after mating, unlike some other species of spider. In fact, many huntsman spiders live peacefully together in large colonies.The female Huntsman produces a flat, oval egg sac of white papery silk and lays up to 200 eggs. She then places it under bark or a rock and stands guard over it, without eating, for about 3 weeks. During this period the female can be quite aggressive and will rear up in a defensive display if provoked. Some species will even carry their egg sac under their bodies while moving about.Delena females lay a ground-sheet of silk upon which the egg sac is anchored while the eggs are laid into it. They will then complete her egg sac and pick it up, leaving the silk ground-sheet behind. Incubation periods vary and are probably influenced by climatic conditions.In some cases (Isopeda), the female may moisten and tear the egg sac open, helping her spiderlings to emerge. The mother stays with them for several weeks. Young Huntsman spiders are pale, with the young of Neosparassus often being green in color. They undergo several molts while still with their mother, hardening to a darker brown and eventually disperse.Huntsman spiders, like all spiders, molt in order to grow and often their old skin may be mistaken for the original spider when seen suspended on bark or in the house. The life span of most Huntsman species is about 2 years or more.\u00a0",
            "venom": "In general, Huntsman spiders are not regarded as dangerous and can be considered beneficial because they feed on insects (Many Australians will relocate Huntsmen to the garden rather than kill them).However, Huntsman spiders give bites that have caused prolonged pain, inflammation, headache, vomiting and irregular pulse rate. However, a scientific study into the bite of these spiders did not note any severe or unusual symptoms resulting from confirmed bites.It is unclear under what circumstances these spiders bite people, however, it is known that female members of this family will aggressively defend against perceived threats to their egg sacs and their young."

During the more plentiful wet season, males and females will separate into different herds. Males will then compete for dominance over territories. Successful males mark their new territories with their urine and faeces. Once they have established the territory, male Impalas will then lure the females into there with tongue-flashing displays. These signals have an effect of making the females group together as they pass through displaying males. Non-resident males flee or flash their own tongues in defiance.Impalas are very quick and agile creatures capable of jumping high in the air performing displays called \u2018pronking\u2019 and clearing heights greater than 3 metres (10 feet) high. When startled, a whole herd will begin to pronk in order to confuse their predators. On occasions when pronking is not being effective, Impalas will flee into dense vegetation to prevent being attacked.Impalas are preyed upon by lions, cheetahs, leopards, hyenas and wild dogs.They can even be attacked by nile crocodiles when near water.",

The female is capable of delaying the birth by an extra month if conditions are harsh. The fawn will remain isolated for a few weeks while the mother returns daily to nurse it. Fawns are weaned at 4 \u2013 6 months. They join a nursery group until they are old enough to join the adult herd.

The Indian Skimmer is found mainly in parts of India and Pakistan and there are estimated to be about 6,000 \u2013 10,000 individuals, however, these numbers may well have fallen below this level given the evidence of declines throughout its range. Indian skimmers are more widespread in winter and are found in coastal estuaries of western and eastern India. Some parts of Africa also provide resident habitats to Skimmers.",
            "indian skimmer characteristics": "Skimmers are medium to large water birds. The Indian Skimmer measures 40 \u2013 43 centimetres (15.8 \u2013 17 inches) in length, weighs around 350 grams and has a wingspan of 108 centimetres (42.5 inches).Indian skimmers are easily recognised birds with their black and white plumage, black head cap, white face and collar and distinctive long, thick, bright orange bill with a yellow tip. Their bills are quite unique in that the upper mandible is somewhat shorter than the lower mandible. The lower mandible is flexible and resembles a knife and is skimmed through the surface of the water, picking up aquatic prey while it flies. The upper mandible is capable of considerable flexibility.The indian skimmer\u2019s wings are long, pointed and black in color with a white trailing edge. Their short, forked tails are white with black central feathers and their legs and feet are red.A quick look at any flying or stationary Skimmer will show the horizontally extended eyes, almost like slits. Only the Skimmer has this type of physical protection against likely water spray when skimming the surface of the ocean.Males and females are similar in appearance, however, males are slightly larger in size. Non-breeding birds are not as brightly colored as breeding birds and tend to be much duller in color. Indian skimmers are sometimes mistaken for Terns as they are similar in appearance.",
            "indian skimmer habitat": "The Indian Skimmer can be found on coastal wetlands and lagoons, large, lowland rivers, lakes, marshes, swamps and estuaries and freshwater sources particularly during the breeding season.",
            "indian skimmer diet": "Skimmers tend to forage in small flocks. These bright billed birds hunt the ocean and up and down large rivers and lakes both during the day and during moonlit nights. Skimmers forage for food by flying low over water with their bills open and their lower mandible ploughing through the waters surface. They show remarkable aerobatic skills as the bill is maintained on a steady path through the surface of the water.Indian Skimmer BeakWhen the bird encounters a fish, the lower mandible is raised up and snapped shut with an up and down movement of the head. Excess water is drained from the beak as the bird lifts itself back into the air. The mandible, therefore, efficiently separates fish and sea protein from the water. The fish is then either eaten in flight or on landing.Indian skimmers feed up on surface-dwelling fish, however, they will also eat small crustaceans and insect larvae. Marine life and sea protein make up a large part of the Skimmer\u2019s diet.",
            "indian skimmer behaviour": "The Indian Skimmer is generally a silent bird but can produce a high nasal \u2018kyap-kyap\u2019 or \u2018kap\u2019 or \u2018kip\u2019 call when disturbed, alarmed or in flight.Indian skimmers are sociable birds who nest in colonies and roost in flocks on sand banks.",
            "indian skimmer reproduction": "Breeding season occurs February to May when colonies of over 40 mating pairs can be seen nesting on sandy islands or open sand banks often accompanied by other birds such as Terns. Nests are simple scrapes in the ground that allow the birds to view any approaching predators.The female lays between 3 \u2013 5 buff white eggs that have brown blotches and streaks on them. The eggs are incubated in the nest during the cooler parts of the day and taken away from the nest to cooler parts when it is the hottest part of the day. The incubating adults are said to soak their bellies with water to help cool the eggs. Eggs are incubated for 21 \u2013 30 days.Young indian skimmers are grey/brown in color with pale fringes on the shoulder feathers, the back and wing coverts. There is more white coloration on their heads than in the adults and their bills are orange with a dark tip. Their bills are equal length when born, but as they approach fledgling age at 35 \u2013 42 days, the lower mandible becomes more elongated.Skimmers reach sexual maturity at 2 years old. The Indian skimmer breeds once a year. The life span of skimmers is unknown but they may well live between 15 \u2013 20 years.",
            "indian skimmer conservation status": "The Indian Skimmer is classed as \u2018Vulnerable\u2019 by the IUCN. It is threatened by loss of habitat and degradation, pollution and disturbance of lowland rivers and lakes. Most colonies are unprotected, however, some lie within nature reserves such as the National Chambal (Gharial) Wildlife Sanctuary in India. Active management has reduced key threats at some wetland sites. African Skimmers are also almost as threatened as the Indian Skimmer.Did you know this about Indian Skimmers?Inexperienced bird watchers might have to look twice to distinguish a Skimmer from a Tern."

During recent years, Italian wolves have also established themselves in Southern France, particularly in the Parc National du Mercantour. It is federally protected in all three countries.",
            "characteristics": "The Italian Wolf is a medium wolf. Male Italian Wolves have an average weight of 24 \u2013 40 kilograms (53 \u2013 88 pounds), with females usually being 10% lighter. The body length of the Italian Wolf is usually 100 \u2013 140 centimetres (39 \u2013 55 inches). Their fur color is commonly blended grey or brown, though black specimens have recently been sighted in the Mugello region and the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines.",
            "diet": "The Italian Wolf is a nocturnal hunter which feeds primarily on medium sized animals such as Chamois, Roe Deer, Red Deer and Wild Boar. In the absence of such prey items, its diet will also include small animals such as hares and rabbits. An Italian wolf can eat up to 1,5 \u2013 3 kilograms of meat a day. The Italian Wolf will occasionally consume berries and herbs for roughage. The Italian Wolf has adapted well in some urbanised areas and as such, will usually not ignore refuse or domestic animals.",
            "behaviour": "Due to a scarcity of large prey, wolf packs in Italy tend to be smaller than average. Packs are usually limited to a nuclear family composed of a reproducing alpha pair, young sub adults which remain with their birth family until they are old enough to disperse and produce cubs. However, in areas where large herbivores such as deer have been reintroduced, such as the Abruzzo National Park, packs consisting of 6 \u2013 7 individuals can be found.",
            "reproduction": "Mating occurs in mid-March with a 2 month gestation period. The number of pups born is dependant on the mothers age, usually ranging from 2 to 8 pups. Italian Wolf pups weigh 250 \u2013 350 grams at birth and open their eyes at the age of 11 \u2013 12 days. Italian Wolf pups are weaned at the age of 35 \u2013 45 days and are fully able to digest meat at 3 \u2013 4 months.",
            "conservation status": "Italian Wolves in ItalyStarting from the 1970s, political debates began favouring the increase in wolf populations. A new investigation began in the early 1980s, in which it was estimated that there were now approximately 220 \u2013 240 animals and growing. New estimates in the 1990s revealed that the wolf populations had doubled, with some wolves taking residence in the Alps, a region not inhabited by wolves for nearly a century. Current estimates indicate that there are 500 \u2013 600 Italian wolves living in the wild. Italian Wolf populations are said to be growing at a rate of 7% annually.Italian Wolves in FranceWolves migrated from Italy to France as recently as 1992. The French wolf population is still no more than 40 \u2013 50 strong, however, the animals have been blamed for the deaths of nearly 2,200 sheep in 2003, up from fewer than 200 in 1994. Controversy also arose when in 2001, a shepherd living on the edge of the Mercantour National Park survived a mauling by three wolves. Under the Berne Convention wolves are listed as an endangered species and killing them is illegal. Official culls are permitted to protect farm animals so long as there is no threat to the Italian Wolf."

            "diet": "Jackals are nocturnal, omnivorous scavengers. With their long legs and curved canine teeth, they are well adapted for hunting. Some Jackals may gather to scavenge a carcass or to hunt larger prey such as antelope, gazelles and livestock but normally hunt alone or in pairs. Their diet consists of small mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles.Jackals kill small prey with a bite to the back of the neck. They may also shake the animal. Jackals will also supplement their diet with insects, vegetation and fruit. Jackals have a habit of burying their food if an intruder enters the area where it is feeding.",
            "behaviour": "Jackals are very territorial and monogamous pairs will fiercely defend their territory from intruders. Territories may also contain some young adults who have remained with their parents until they are able to establish their own territories. Both male and female jackals scent mark their boundaries. The Black-backed Jackal is the most commonly seen species as it is diurnal. The other two species have a tendency to behave nocturnally. Jackals are adaptable animals and can adapt easily to changing environments. They trot quickly through their territories, frequently stopping to sniff the air and smell for food.Jackals are very vocal and communicate with each other using a loud yell or yap, growls and high pitched howls, particularly when prey is located. The Side-striped Jackal uses a \u2018hoot\u2019 sound like an owls rather than a howl. Jackals will only take notice of the calls from their family and will ignore all other calls.Jackals are preyed upon by eagles, leopards and hyenas. Eagles are the biggest threat to newborn pups.",
            "reproduction": "Jackals are monogamous, meaning they mate for life. The female Jackal has a gestation period of 8 \u2013 9 weeks (2 months) after which a litter of 3 \u2013 6 pups is born. Each pup weighs 200 \u2013 250 grams at birth. For the first 10 days, the pups are blind and cannot open their eyes. The pups are fed regurgitated food. They are weaned at 4 months and they reach sexual maturity between 1 and 2 years of age.Pups remain in thickets for the first few weeks of their lives and then venture outside to play with their litter mates. They eventually begin to learn hunting and territorial behaviour from their parents. Their first game play is quite clumsy with attempts at wrestling, pawing and biting. As the pups develop more coordination, they learn to ambush and pounce and will begin to chase and play tug of war among themselves.Den sites are changed as often as every 2 weeks to help protect the pups from predators. At 8 months, the pups are old enough to leave their parents and establish territories of their own. Often, young jackals return to help the parents raise another litter. With these little helpers, the next litter has more chance of surviving. Jackals have a life span of between 10 and 12 years.",

It is one of four \u2018big cats\u2019 in the \u2018Panthera\u2019 genus, along with the tiger, lion and leopard of the Old World. The jaguar is the third largest feline after the tiger and the lion. The jaguar is the largest and most powerful feline in the Western Hemisphere. The Jaguars present range extends from Mexico (with occasional sightings in the southwestern United States) across much of Central America and south to Paraguay and northern Argentina. \u00a0",
            "characteristics": "The Jaguar is a compact and well-muscled animal. Rainforest jaguars are generally darker and considerably smaller than those found in open areas, possibly due to the fewer large herbivorous prey in forest areas.Jaguars grow to be about 1.62 \u2013 1.83 metres (5.3 \u2013 6 feet) in length and stand about 67 \u2013 76 centimetres (27 \u2013 30 inches) tall at the shoulders. Their tail is 2 \u2013 3 feet (0.6 \u2013 0.9 metres) long. Jaguars weigh around 36 kilograms (80 pounds). Larger jaguars have been recorded as weighing 131 \u2013 151 kilograms (288 \u2013 333 pounds).The base coat of the jaguar is generally a tawny yellow in color, but can range to reddish-brown and black. The jaguar is covered in \u2018rosettes\u2019 for camouflage in its jungle habitat.The spots vary over individual coats and between individual Jaguars. The \u2018rosettes\u2019 may include one or several dots and the shape of the dots varies. The spots on the head and neck are generally solid, as are those on the tail, where they may merge to form a band. The underbelly, throat and outer surface of the legs and lower flanks are white.Rare albino individuals, sometimes called \u2018white panthers\u2019, occur among jaguars, as with the other big cats.The jaguar physically most closely resembles the leopard, although the jaguar is of sturdier build and its behavioural and habitat characteristics are closer to those of the tiger.Jaguars are the second strongest of all mammals. The jaguar has a short, stocky limb structure which makes it well adaptable to climbing, crawling and swimming. Their heads are robust and their jaw is extremely powerful.\u00a0",
            "diet": "Jaguars are carnivores (meat-eaters). Jaguars will eat a variety of animals including birds, eggs and mammals including capybaras, peccaries, tapirs, turtles and alligators. Jaguars often bury their prey after killing it, so that they can eat it later. The jaguar is often described as nocturnal, but is more specifically crepuscular (peak activity around dawn and dusk).The jaguar is a largely solitary, stalk-and-ambush predator and is opportunistic in prey selection. It is also an apex predator (predators that, as adults, are not normally preyed upon in the wild in significant parts of their range by creatures not of their own species) and a keystone predator, playing an important role in stabilizing ecosystems and regulating the populations of prey species.The jaguar has developed an exceptionally powerful bite, even compared to the other big cats. This allows it to pierce the shells of armoured reptiles and to employ an unusual killing method. The jaguar bites directly through the skull of prey between the ears to deliver a fatal blow to the brain.It has been reported that an individual jaguar can drag a 360 kilograms (800 pounds) bull 8 metres (25 feet) long in its jaws and crush the heaviest bones. The jaguar hunts wild animals weighing up to 300 kilograms (660 pounds) in dense jungle and its short and sturdy physique is therefore an adaptation to its prey and environment.\u00a0",
            "habitat": "Jaguars are large, wild, graceful cats that live in rainforests, swamps, deserts and shrubby areas. These solitary felines often have dens in caves. It is strongly associated with the presence of water and is, along with the tiger, a very good swimmer.",
            "behaviour": "Jaguars are territorial. Like most cats, the jaguar is solitary outside mother-cub groups. Adults generally meet only to court and mate and carve out large territories for themselves. Female territories, from 25 to 40 square kilometres in size, may overlap, but the animals generally avoid one another. Male ranges cover roughly twice as much area, varying in size with the availability of game and space and do not overlap. Scrape marks, urine and faeces are used to mark territory.Like the other big cats, the jaguar is capable of roaring (the male more powerfully) and does so to warn territorial and mating competitors away. Intensive bouts of counter-calling between individuals have been observed in the wild. Their roar often resembles a repetitive cough and they may also vocalize mews and grunts. Mating fights between males occur, but are rare. Conflict is typically over territory. A males range may include that of two or three females however he will not tolerate intrusions by other adult males.",
            "reproduction": "Female jaguars reach sexual maturity at about 2 years of age and males at 3 or 4 years of age. The jaguar is believed to mate throughout the year in the wild, although births may increase when prey is plentiful. Female Jaguars estrous is 6 \u2013 17 days out of a full 37 day cycle and females will advertise fertility with urinary scent marks and increased vocalization. Both male and female jaguars will range more widely than usual during courtship.Mating pairs separate after mating and females provide all the parental care. The gestation period lasts 93 \u2013 105 days. Female Jaguars give birth to up to 4 cubs but most commonly to only 2 cubs. The mother will not tolerate the presence of males after the birth of cubs, given a risk of infant cannibalism. This behaviour is also found in the tiger.The young are born blind, gaining sight after 2 weeks. Cubs are weaned at 3 months but remain in the birth den for 6 months before leaving to accompany their mother on hunts. They will continue in their mothers company for one to two years before leaving to establish a territory for themselves. Young males are at first leave, jostling with the older jaguars until they succeed in claiming a territory. Typical life span of the jaguar in the wild is estimated at around 12 \u2013 15 years. In captivity, the jaguar lives up to 23 years, placing it among the longest living cats.",
            "conservation status": "Jaguars are an endangered species due to loss of habitat and over-hunting by man and its numbers are declining.All hunting of jaguars is prohibited in Argentina, Belize, Colombia, French Guiana, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, the United States (where it is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act), Uruguay and Venezuela.Hunting of jaguars is restricted to \u2018problem animals\u2019 in Brazil, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru, while trophy hunting is still permitted in Bolivia. The species has no legal protection in Ecuador or Guyana.Current conservation efforts often focus on educating ranch owners and promoting ecotourism (a form of tourism that appeals to the ecologically and socially conscious individuals). The jaguar is generally defined as an \u2018umbrella species\u2019 a species whose home range and habitat requirements are sufficiently broad that, if protected, numerous other species of smaller range will also be protected. Umbrella species serve as \u2018mobile links\u2019 at the landscape scale, in the jaguars case through predation. Conservation organizations may therefore focus on providing viable, connected habitat for the jaguar, with the knowledge that other species will also benefit."

It will defend its territory with a quick peck if the territorial display fails.\u00a0The female builds a flimsy nest of twigs, roots and grasses, which are collected by her mate, in a tree and lays one or sometimes two white eggs which are incubated for about 20 days to hatching, with a further 12 or more days to fledging.Both parents help in raising the hatchling. Within an hour of its birth, the helpless hatchling will be fed doves milk, a nutritious secretion that both parents make in their crops.The chicks early development concentrates on growing feathers and becoming coordinated instead of growth. Around the 10th day its eyes open for the first time, but its wings will already be functional. Shortly after, it leaves the nest with its parents, who stay very close.The chick is then weaned at 8 \u2013 10 weeks. The young male will look a lot like a female in coloring, but by 9 months it will have its full coloring.",

            "desc": "The Japanese spider crab (Macrocheira kaempferi) is a species of marine crab. It is the largest known living arthropod and has the largest leg span of any arthropod, sometimes measuring up to 12.5 feet from the tip of one front claw to the other. Japanese spider crabs live in the waters around Japan, and get their name from its resemblance to a spider. The ancestry of spider crabs can be traced all the way back to prehistoric times, but it was first described by Western science in 1836 by Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck. The name Macrocheira kaempferi comes from Engelbert Kaempfer, a German naturalist and physician who studied plants in Japan during the 17th century. Their Japanese name, Taka-Ashi-Gani, translates to \u201ctall legs crab\u201d.",
            "lifespan": "The Japanese spider crab has the longest lifespan of any crab, and can live to be 100 years old!",
            "behavior": "Despite the intimidating appearance of these animals, the Japanese spider crab is harmless and is a slow-moving creature. As a decorator crab, it adorns its exoskeleton with algae and sponges to increase its camouflage to hide from predators like octopuses and fish. That being said, there are actually few predators at the depths in which they live.Because these crabs have a hard outer shell (the exoskeleton) that does not grow, they must shed their shells. This unique molting behavior occurs for 103 minutes, in which the crab loses its mobility and starts molting its carapace rear and ends with molting its walking legs. This can be dangerous for them, as they can get stuck in their existing shells or be preyed on by other crabs during the molting period.Little is known about the behavior of spider crabs because they live so deep, but it is thought they are not very sociable animals. They usually forage for food alone and there is little communication between the individuals, even when they are kept in captivity.",
            "reproduction": "Mating season is between January and April and, during this time, Japanese spider crabs migrate to the shallower end of their depth range. Fertilization is internal, with the male inserting a spermatophore, or sperm packet, into the female as their abdomens press together.The female\u2019s abdomen, also called the apron, is where she carries the fertilized eggs, and she can lay up to one million. However, only a few of the million offspring will survive to adulthood. They hatch into tiny planktonic larvae within 10 days.While Japanese spider crabs are very large, these larvae are very small and undergo four stages of development before they mature into adulthood. The firsts stage lasts only a few minutes, before the molt into two zoeal stages (planktonic) and one megalopa stage, all of which happen rapidly. The speed at which this happens depends on the temperature of the wter, and the temperature can also determine whether these larvae live or die.At their zoeal stage, spider crabs look nothing like their parents, and small and transparent with a round, legless body and usually drifts as plankton at the surface of the ocean. Once hatched, they will get no parental care.",
            "diet": "Japanese spider crabs are omnivorous scavengers, feeding on any matter they can find on the seafloor and occasionally hunting for small invertebrates like crustaceans. Because they are slow-moving, they prefer to eat dead animals or plant matter, but they will also eat live fish.",
            "location and habitat": "The Japanese Spider crab is found in the Pacific Ocean around parts of Japan. It is found on the seabed, often inhabiting vents and holes on the ocean floor at depths of 160 to 2,000 feet (50-600 m), and their bodies allow them to blend in well with the ocean floor. They thrive in temperatures of about 50 degrees.\u00a0Conservation StatusJapanese spider crabs have not been evaluated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. However, their numbers have been declining in recent years, mainly due to fishing. While it is difficult for fishermen to catch the giant Japanese spider crab because of the depth at which it is found, and the species is not widely exploited commercially, it is considered a rare delicacy in Asia. This has led to more and more spider crabs being caught for their meat around the Japanese islands.To combat this, there has been a ban placed on the amount of fishing that can take place. Fishing for them has been banned in Japan during the spider crab\u2019s breeding season.\u00a0"

The population is now confined to around 40 \u2013 50 animals in the Ujung Kulon National Park on the western tip of the island of Java.The Vietnamese Javan Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus annamiticus), or Vietnamese Rhinoceros, once lived across Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and into Thailand and Malaysia. Annamiticus is derived from the Annamite Mountain Range in Southeast Asia, part of this subspecies range. A single population, estimated at less than 12 remaining rhinos, lives in an area of lowland forest in the Cat Tien National Park in Vietnam. Genetic analysis suggests that the two extant subspecies last shared a common ancestor between 300,000 and 2 million years ago.The Indian Javan Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus inermis), once ranged from Bengal to Burma, however, it is presumed to have gone extinct in the first decade of the 1900\u2019s. Inermis means without horns, as the most distinctive characteristic of this sub-species is the small horns in males and lack of horns in females. The original specimen of this species was a hornless female. The political situation in Burma has prevented assessment of the species in that country, however, its survival is considered unlikely.All three subspecies of Javan rhinoceros are classed as Critically Endangered.",
            "anatomy": "",
            "conservation status": "The main causes of the decline in numbers of the Javan Rhino have been habitat loss resulting from logging activities and development, combined with hunting for body parts, which are in demand for use in Oriental medicines. The two critically small populations are also vulnerable to disease, natural disasters, poaching and genetic problems caused by inbreeding.At present, there are no Javan Rhinoceroses in captivity. Although they reside in protected areas, the above pressures are still effecting them greatly. Although park ranges have been increased and the resident countries have banned poaching and signed certain agreements not to trade in these animals, it may be too late to save this critically rare species."

There are even some Jellyfish that live in fresh water lakes and rivers.Jellyfish usually drift, however, occasionally you will see them swimming. Jellyfish swim by rhythmic pulsations of the umbrella or bell. The movement is very like an umbrella being open and shut slowly. It is coordinated by a very simple nervous system and by sense organs around the edge that are sensitive to light and gravity and chemicals in the water. Jellyfish are slow swimmers but speed and low water resistance are not important because they are drifters that feed on plankton. It is more important for them that their movements create a current where the water (which contains their food) is being forced within reach of their tentacles.",
            "diet": "Most jellyfish are passive drifters that feed on small fish and zooplankton that become caught in their tentacles. Jellyfish also eat small animals such as shrimps. Some of the animals Jellyfish eat are microscopic, too small to be seen by the human eye. Jellyfish also eat other Jellyfish of other species. They catch their prey by using nematocysts, small stinging organs present in the tentacles and oral arms.",
            "stings": "The complete lack of a brain means that the jellyfish cannot help but sting you \u2013 unless it is a Box Jellyfish (Chironex fleckeri) which can control itself efficiently, even without a brain. This Jellyfish has 3 million stinging cells every centimetre of its tentacles. The Box jelly is responsible for at least one death a year around Australia and has killed 67 people since records began in 1883, though the total is misleading since many deaths attributed to heart attacks or drowning could have been caused by toxic jellies.If the stinging cells [nematocysts] of a jellyfish make contact with your skin they will release their poison into it.Symptoms include:severe painheadache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoeaskin swelling/wounds/rednessdifficulty breathing, swallowing and speechshivering, sweatingirregular pulse/heart failureSting treatments:pour vinegar over tentacles. Urine does not work on the Box Jelly or Irukandji.lift off any tentacles with a stick or similar.use pressure-immobilisation on limbs if possible. i.e. quickly wrap a light bandage above and below the sting (if you cannot get two fingers under the bandage, it is too tight).Immobilize/splint the stung area and keep it at heart level [gravity-neutral] if possible. Too high causes venom to travel to the heart, too low causes more swelling.Do not drink alcohol, or take any medicine or food.get medical treatment urgently or apply antivenom if available.Some kinds of Jellyfish stings are like miniature harpoons with barbs on the end that inject poison to paralyze their prey. Some Jellyfish have sticky harpoons and others wrap their harpoons around their prey to trap it.What is a Group of Jellyfish Called?A group of jellyfish is called a \u2018bloom\u2019 or \u2018swarm\u2019.How Long do Jellyfish Live?On average, jellyfish will live anywhere from 1-2 years.

Kestrels have keen eyesight enabling them to spot small prey from a distance. They are able to hover at a height of around 10 \u2013 20 metres over open countryside.Kestrels hover effortlessly for long periods of time by flying into a light headwind and making continuous small adjustments to its wings and tail while it hangs on an rising draught of air.While hovering, the Kestrels head is kept perfectly still giving it the ability to spot the slightest movements on the ground. When suitable prey is in sight, the Kestrel drops vertically towards the ground, swooping to grab its prey in its talons and killing it with a swift bite. Kestrels can often be found hunting along the sides of roads and motorways. Kestrels also frequently use pylons or telegraph poles as vantage points to spot prey, saving themselves the effort of hovering.Kestrels are bold and have adapted well to human encroachment, nesting in buildings and hunting by major roads.In more northerly and westerly areas of Britain, kestrels often migrate south at the end of the breeding season, but return the following spring to form their territories. In winter many more kestrels visit from the Netherlands and Scandinavia.The call of the Kestrel is a loud shrill \u2018kee-kee-kee\u2019, which can sometimes be confused with Nuthatch calls.",

            "desc": "The King Cobra Snake  (Ophiophagus hannah) is the largest venomous snake in the world. The King Cobra snake is also perhaps the most dangerous snake in the world where humans are concerned. Under conditions of high prey availability they can reach a length of 18.5 feet. Several people die from the bite of the King Cobra each year. A King Cobra can even kill an elephant.  The King Cobra snake is the largest of the venomous land snakes, growing up to 18.5 feet (5.7 metres) in length and with a width of up to 1 foot (0.3 metres) at the neck. However, as they are generally slender, King Cobras usually do not exceed 44 pounds (20 kilograms) in weight. Male King Cobras are longer and weigh more than female King Cobras, this is very unusual since in most snake species, the male is smaller than the female.",
            "king cobra snake characteristics": "The King Cobra snake is the largest of the venomous land snakes, growing up to 18.5 feet (5.7 metres) in length and with a width of up to 1 foot (0.3 metres) at the neck. However, as they are generally slender, King Cobras usually do not exceed 44 pounds (20 kilograms) in weight. Male King Cobras are longer and weigh more than female King Cobras, this is very unusual since in most snake species, the male is smaller than the female.The King Cobra can lift a third of its body off the ground. In fact, an 18 foot King Cobra, if stood upright, could actually look down onto the average human being. Like other snakes bearing the cobra name, the King Cobra can also flatten its neck, giving it the distinctive hood. When the King Cobra is threatened or on the attack, it will hiss, rear up and flatten its neck ribs into the hood. There are false eyespots on the hood, which can scare some predators.Even though their scaly skin glistens, it is actually dry to the touch. Adults cobras are yellow, green, brown, or black. Their throat is light yellow or cream colored. Juveniles are black with yellow or white bars crossing the body.",
            "king cobra snake habitat": "The King Cobra snake lives in much of mainland South East Asia and throughout the dense highland forests. The King Cobra has a preference for living in areas where there are lakes and streams as it is an excellent swimmer. King Cobra populations have reclined in some areas of its range due to the destruction of forests, however, despite this the snake is not listed by the IUCN as in danger of becoming extinct. The King Cobra is said to be the only snake which makes nests for its eggs. It is widely worshipped in India as nagaraja (\u2018king of snakes\u2019).",
            "king cobra snake behaviour and diet": "A Group of King Cobras is called a \u2018Quiver\u2019. Despite the King Cobras fearsome reputation, it is generally a shy and reclusive animal, avoiding confrontation with people as much as possible. There are many smaller venomous snakes within this species range that are responsible for a far greater number of fatal snake bites.The King Cobra snakes diet is mainly composed of other snakes (ophiophagy \u2013 a specialized form of feeding or alimentary behaviour of animals which hunt and eat snakes). The King Cobra snake prefers non-venomous snakes, however, it will also eat other venomous snakes including kraits and Indian Cobras. Cannibalism is not rare. When food is scarce, King Cobras will also feed on other small vertebrates such as lizards. Like all snakes, they swallow the prey whole, head first. The top and bottom jaws are attached to each other with stretchy ligaments, which let the snake swallow animals wider that itself. Snakes cannot chew their prey. Food is digested by very strong acids in the snakes stomach. After a large meal the snake may live for many months without another meal due to a very slow metabolic rate. King Cobras are able to hunt at all times of day, although it is rarely seen at night, leading some to debate whether it is a diurnal species.King Cobras, like other snakes, smell using their forked tongue which picks up scent particles and transfers them to a special sensory receptor (Jacobson\u2019s Organ), located in the roof of its mouth. When the scent of a potential meal has been detected, the snake will continue to flick its tongue to gauge the preys direction. It will also rely on its excellent eyesight. The King Cobra snake is able to detect moving prey almost 300 feet (100 metres) away. The King Cobra snake uses sensitivity to vibrations and outstanding intelligence (compared to that of other cobra species) to track its prey.",
            "king cobra snake reproduction": "Breeding usually takes place in late spring or early summer. After mating, the male will return back to its own home. The female will then lay between 10 and 25 eggs. The offspring are independent as soon as they are born and can capture prey the size of a rat.Breeding takes place when the two snakes twist their bodies together and can last for days in this position. Females wait approximately 55 days before laying eggs. Female offspring are not bigger than male offspring. The King Cobra snakes average life span is about 20 years.",
            "king cobra snake venom": "The King Cobras venom is a neurotoxin, capable of killing humans. The mortality rate can be as high as 75%, however, most bites involve nonfatal amounts.Their venom is not the most potent among venomous snakes, however, the amount of neurotoxin they can deliver in a single bite \u2013 up to two-tenths of a fluid ounce (seven millilitres) \u2013 is enough to kill 20 people, or even an elephant. Fortunately, king cobras are shy and will avoid humans whenever possible. King Cobra snakes are fiercely aggressive when cornered or provoked.King Cobra venom, which is composed mostly of proteins and polypeptides, is produced in specialized salivary glands just behind the snakes eyes. When biting its prey, venom is forced through the snakes half \u2013 inch \u2013 long (8 \u2013 10 millimetre) fangs and into the wound. Although the venom is less toxic than that of many other venomous snakes, including the Indian Cobra, a King Cobra is capable of injecting more venom than any other snake except the gaboon viper. In fact, a King Cobra can deliver enough venom to kill a full-grown Asian Elephant in 3 hours.King Cobra venom attacks the victims nervous system and quickly induces severe pain, blurred vision, vertigo, drowsiness and paralysis. In the minutes following, cardiovascular collapse occurs and the victim falls into a coma. Death soon follows due to respiratory failure."

        "King Penguin": {
            "image": "https://animalcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/king-penguin-2-340x200.jpg",
            "desc": "King Penguins live on the subantarctic islands at the northern reaches of Antarctica, as well as Tierra del Fuego, the Falkland Islands and other temperate islands of the region. The King penguin is the second largest penguin. It is sometimes confused with the larger Emperor penguin. Despite the specific name of \u2018patagonicus\u2019, King penguins no longer breed in Patagonia, or indeed any other part of South America. King Penguins would previously breed on Islas de los Estados (Staten Island) until the colony was wiped out by sealers during the 19th Century. ",
            "characteristics": "Distinctive features of the King penguin include a silvery-grey back with a blackish-brown head decorated with striking ear patches of bright golden-orange feathers. Adults are 90 centimetres tall and weigh about 15 \u2013 16 kilograms. King penguins have adapted well to their extreme living conditions in the subantarctic.To keep warm, King penguins have four layers of feathering. The outer layer of feathers are oiled and waterproof, not unlike the feathering of a duck. The inner three layers are down feathers which are very effective insulation. A chick is born without the oily outer layer and therefore cannot fish until maturity.",
            "diet": "King penguins eat small fish, mainly lantern fish and squid and rely less than most Southern Ocean predators on krill and other crustaceans. On foraging trips they repeatedly dive to depths over 100 metres (350 feet), often over 200 metres (700 feet). This is far deeper than other penguins, other than their closest relative, the larger Emperor penguin.Ice and water in Antarctica is primarily salty, making it impossible for most animals to drink. The king penguins stomach, however, has adapted to drinking salt water. Its powerful stomach can separate the salt completely, allowing the bird to drink without becoming dehydrated.",
            "behaviour": "Although their climate is far less harsh than that endured by Emperor Penguins, the large, closely-packed colonies are able to survive the winter storms by combining the body heat of the community. Tens of thousands of birds may huddle together for warmth.King Penguins are sleeker than other penguins, with proportionately longer flippers. The King penguins hydrodynamic body allows it to glide through the water with ease.The famous penguin waddle is an obvious way for the penguin to get around but there is a much faster way, the King penguin just uses its stomach and slides along the smooth plains of ice. This is called \u2018tobogganing\u2019. However, unlike the Emperor Penguin, the King Penguin lives on rookeries on land that is free of ice for much of the year, and as most colonies are on beaches, King Penguins do not need to travel as far over land as their larger cousins.Although accurate counts have not been carried out in recent years, St Andrews Bay on South Georgia, has a single colony, which has grown partly due to the increased space available from glacier retreat, which may have 500,000 King Penguins at the busiest times of year.",
            "reproduction": "The male King penguin incubates the egg as much as male Emperor penguins do, however, the King penguins do this during the warmer summer season, when more food is available. Once the egg is laid, the male will care for it. The female goes to the open sea and will return in around 21 days to take her turn keeping the egg warm. The male will only go about one month without food. The chick hatches in around 54 days. The chick is cared for by both parents for 30 to 40 days. At this time it joins a cr\u00e8che for warmth and protection from predators.The parents return to sea to feed. They take turns bringing food to the chick every other day. The chick grows quickly during the warm summer weather. When autumn and winter comes the parents go back to sea to feed.The chick grows a warm brown fluffy down of feathers. They also grow a thick layer of blubber to keep them warm during the winter months ahead. The chicks huddle in their cr\u00e8ches during the winter months while the parents occasionally come onshore to feed them. In the spring the parents come back and start feeding the chicks again.At this time, the chicks starts to grow their adult feathers and are ready to go off on their own. Raising a King penguin chick usually takes 10 to 13 months. This allows the adults to raise only one chick every other year. Early explorers of the region thought the brown chicks were another species of penguins. They called them the \u2018woolly penguins\u2019.",
            "predators": "At sea, the key predators of King penguins are the leopard seals and killer whales who wait beneath the surface near the shore for unsuspecting birds.",
            "conservation": "Human impact is currently very low, despite King penguins being a great tourist attraction in the Falklands. King penguins are very tolerant of human presence and are not alarmed by the presence of tourists, provided that they remain at the outskirts of the colony. There is no direct exploitation of King penguins and they are seldom caught as a result of commercial fishing, other than through the occasional discarded net.There is very little overlap between the prey of King penguins and commercially harvested species of squid and fish. Fishing industries are therefore unlikely to greatly influence King penguin population trends. With an estimated population of nearly 2 million pairs, there are no particular concerns for this species at present."

        "King Salmon": {
            "image": "https://animalcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/king-salmon-340x200.png",
            "desc": "The king salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), also known as the Chinook salmon, Quinnat salmon, Tsumen, spring salmon, chrome hog, Blackmouth, and Tyee salmon, is the largest species of Pacific salmon in the genus Oncorhynchus. It is also the largest member of this genus. This fish is native to the North Pacific Ocean and the river systems of western North America, ranging from California to Alaska, as well as Asian rivers ranging from northern Japan to the Palyavaam River in the Arctic northeast Siberia. The king salmon is often caught for food, with the flesh being highly valued for its dietary nutritional content, which includes high levels of important omega-3 fatty acids. The fish is both farmed and caught in the wild. According to NOAA the Chinook salmon population along the California coast is declining, due to overfishing.",
            "lifespan": "The Chinook salmon has an average lifespan of between four to six years. However, some can spend up to 8 years in the ocean or return after less than one year. Northern king salmon are likely to have longer lifespans than southern salmon.King salmon are often killed due to predation, or because young who do not reach a certain size before their first winter at sea will not survive colder temperatures.",
            "diet": "The king salmon\u2019s diet changes depending on where they are living. In freshwater, as fry and smolts, they feed on plankton, aquatic insects, amphipods and crustaceans. After migrating to the ocean, the maturing adults feed on large zooplakton, herring, pilchard, sandlance and other fishes, squid, krill and crustaceans. Once the adult salmon have re-entered freshwater, they do not feed.",
            "behavior": "King salmon are anadromous, migrating out to the deepest parts of the ocean and returning as mature adults to their natal streams. Juvenile salmon grow in clean, productive estuarine environments and gain the energy for migration. Later, they change physiologically to live in salt water.They may spend one to eight years in the ocean (averaging from three to four years) before returning to their home rivers to spawn. The salmon undergo\u00a0radical morphological changes as they prepare for the spawning event ahead, including a change in color. They need a healthy open ocean habitat to acquire the strength needed to travel back upstream, escape predators, and reproduce before dying.In order to return to the right stream, they use un-compass orientation out in the open ocean and then smell. All the adults return at the same time, spawn at the same time, and then the young all migrate at the same time.",
            "reproduction": "King salmon all return to their natal streams and spawn at approximately the same time of year. They spawn in larger and deeper waters than other salmon species and can be found on the spawning redds (nests) from September to December. They use larger sediment (gravel) sizes for spawning than other Pacific salmon and clean, cool, oxygenated, sediment-free fresh water is essential for egg development.During the courtship, which can last up to several hours, the male vibrates and crosses in front of the female, while the female is preparing for spawning by digging the redd. The female has been shown to selectively choose larger males, who vibrate more.The female will then lay her eggs (3000-14000) in the nest, sometimes in 4-5 different packets within a single redd. The male then deposits his sperm, and both parents guard the redd until they die, which happens sometime within the next 25 days.Chinook eggs hatch 90 to 150 days after deposition, depending upon water temperature, but always emerge in the spring. They will stay in fresh water 12 to 18 months before traveling downstream to estuaries, where they remain as smolts (spawn) for several months.The king salmon juveniles divide into two types: ocean-type and stream-type. Ocean-type king salmon migrate to salt water in their first year, but stream-type salmon spend one full year in fresh water before migrating to the ocean.While salmon are semalparous, and shortly after spawning they die, their decomposing carcasses provide necessary nutrients to the eggs and fry.",
            "location and habitat": "King salmon are native to the North Pacific Ocean from Monterey Bay, California to the Chukchi Sea, Alaska in North America and from the Anadyr River, Siberia to Hokkaido, Japan in Asia. This fish has also been introduced to places, such as the Great Lakes and New Zealand.The king salmon is anadromous, meaning they are born in freshwater, migrate to the ocean, and return as mature adults to their natal streams to spawn. The streams in which they reside are relatively deep with course gravel and always freshwater. The water must be cool, around 14 degrees, for them to survive, and fast flowing.Vegetation and woody debris within the stream are preferred, especially as they help juvenile salmon by providing cover and maintaining low water temperatures. The salmon rely on eelgrass and seaweeds for camouflage (as protection from predators), shelter, and foraging habitat as they make their way to the open ocean.In the sea, the king salmon can be found close to the shore or very deep in the water. Algae is very important to their habitat, because increased algal levels lead to higher levels of carbon dioxide in the water, which transfers into living organisms, helping underwater plants to grow and small organisms to develop, which salmon eat. Algae also filters high levels of toxins and pollutants.King Salmon Conservation StatusThe king salmon is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List, although some populations are threatened. Nine populations of Chinook salmon are listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act as either threatened or endangered. They are particularly threatened by overfishing and habitat loss.These fish are a popular food for humans, and they are both farmed and caught in the wild. The world\u2019s largest producer and market supplier of the Chinook salmon is New Zealand.Damming has also caused decline in these species because it blocks adults from returning to their birthplace and because smolts often get sucked into the turbines of hydroelectric dams and are killed.",
            "predators": "As fry and smolts, king salmon are very likely to be preyed on. They are eaten by striped bass, American shad, sculpins and sea gulls. When they return to the freshwater to spawn as adults, they are also commonly preyed on by bears, orcas, sea lions, seals, otters, eagles, terns and cormorants. They are much less likely to be preyed on when they are at sea, but they can be attacked by large mammals such as killer whales.To make it to sea successfully, they rely on eelgrass and seaweeds for camouflage so they can stay undetected by predators.\u00a0"

The Kinkajou is the only member of the genus \u2018Potos\u2019 Native to Mexico, Central American rainforests and South American rainforests, this arboreal mammal is not particularly rare, though it is rarely seen by people because of its strict nocturnal habits. Kinkajous may be mistaken for ferrets or monkeys, but they are not related.",
            "characteristics": "The kinkajou has gold woolly fur which overlaps grey. Kinkajous also have short-haired, fully prehensile tails (like some New World monkeys), which they use as a fifth hand in climbing. An average adult kinkajou weighs 2 \u2013 3 kilograms (4 \u2013 7 pounds). Kinkajous grow to an average body length of 17 \u2013 22 inches, their tail is 16 \u2013 22 inches in length in addition to the body.Kinkajous do not use their prehensile tails for grasping food. The prehensile tail distinguishes kinkajous from the related olingos who are small procyonids native to the rainforests of Central and South America. Olingos are arboreal and nocturnal and live at elevations from sea level to 2,000 metres. Olingos lack prehensile tails.Kinkajous sleep in hollow trees. They spend most of their lives in the branches of trees, using their prehensile tail to grasp branches.Kinkajous are sometimes kept as pets. Their personality tends to be playful and curious, and they are generally tame. However, some owners report unpredictable, vicious attacks by their kinkajous even after several years of non-aggression.",
            "diet": "Although Kinkajous are classified in the order Carnivora and equipped with sharp teeth, they actually primarily eat fruit. One source of help in getting fruit in small areas is their long tongue that is slender and has a length of 5 inches. The tongue is also used to obtain nectar from flowers, allowing the kinkajou to play the role of a pollinator. Nectar is sometimes also obtained by simply eating flowers.Kinkajous will also eat insects (like termites), small mammals and birds.Although captive animals will eat honey (earning them the name \u2018Honey Bear\u2019), it has never been observed in the diet of wild kinkajous, however, they have been know to collect honey from bee hives with their long, slender tongues.",
            "behaviour": "Like raccoons (also members of the family Procyonidae), kinkajous have remarkable manipulative abilities, in this respect rivaling primates.Kinkajous sleep together in family units and groom each other. While they are usually solitary when foraging, they occasionally do so in small groups and sometimes also associate with olingos.Kinkajous do not like to be awake during the day and dislike noise or sudden movements. If they are agitated too much, they may emit a scream and attack, usually clawing their victim and biting deeply.Kinkajou bites are particularly dangerous as their saliva contains a sticky, species-bacterium \u2013 \u2018Kingella potus\u2019, first identified by Dr. Paul Lawson of the University of Oklahoma.",
            "communication": "A major method of communication between kinkajous is by scent. Kinkajous have scent glands near the mouth, on the throat and on the belly. Making sounds (grunting and growling) is another way these animals communicate.During the night, it is possible to hear the Kinkajou vocalizing. Their shrill calls resemble a womans scream. For this reason, one folk name for the kinkajou is \u2018la llorona\u2019 which translates directly from the Spanish language into \u2018the crying woman\u2019.",
            "reproduction": "Female Kinkajous give birth to one tiny baby (two babies are less common). At birth, the baby kinkajou is blind, but it can grasp objects with its strong tail.",
            "conservation status": "Hunters of the kinkajou include the fox, jaguarundi, jaguar, ocelot, margay, tayra and people. However, they are not an endangered species and their status is \u2018Least Concern\u2019."

            "desc": "The Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is an Australian arboreal marsupial which is native to parts of Australia particularly Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales. The word koala comes from the Dharuk word \u2018gula\u2019. The word is said to mean \u2018does not drink\u2019 as the Koala receives over 90% of its moisture from the Eucalyptus leaves (also known as gum leaves) that are its main diet. Koalas are sometimes called \u2018Koala Bears\u2019, however, they are not really bears although they have been thought to resemble teddy bears. The closest living relative of the Koala is a Wombat who is of similar appearance. Koalas are thick-set animals with thick, soft, wool-like ash-grey colored coats with white underparts.",
            "description": "Koalas are thick-set animals with thick, soft, wool-like ash-grey colored coats with white underparts.Their fur protects them from both high and low temperatures and acts like a raincoat to repel moisture when it rains.The fur on a koalas bottom is densely packed to provide a \u2018cushion\u2019 for the hard branches it sits upon.Mature males are recognisable by the brown \u2018scent gland\u2019 in the centre of their white chest.Koalas have large ears with white hairs at the tips and small eyes. The Koalas nose is one of its most important features and it has a very highly developed sense of smell. This is necessary to differentiate between types of eucalyptus leaves and to detect whether the leaves are poisonous or not. Koalas limbs are long and they have large sharp claws to assist them with climbing trees. Koalas have 5 digits and are equipped with opposable thumbs which help them to grasp objects such as food and branches.Koalas are one of the few mammal species that actually have fingerprints. Koala fingerprints are similar to human fingerprints and it is quite difficult to tell them apart, even under a microscope. A Koalas weight varies from 30 pounds (14 kilograms) for larger species to 11 pounds (5 kilograms) for smaller species. The average Koala grows to be around 2 feet tall.Koalas have similar teeth to those of a Kangaroo or Wombat which are adapted to their herbivorous diets. Their sharp incisors clip off leaves at the front of their mouths and their grinding cheek teeth chew their food. A gap between the incisors and the molars, called a \u2018diastema\u2019, allows the tongue to move the mass of leaves around the mouth efficiently.Koalas have an excellent sense of balance which means they are well suited to life in the trees. Their lean, muscular bodies help support their weight when climbing up a tree. Their climbing strength comes from their thigh muscles joining their shins much lower than in other animals.The Koalas digestive system is especially adapted to detoxify the poisonous chemicals in the eucalyptus leaves. The toxins are thought to be produced by the gum trees as a protection against leaf-eating animals like insects. Trees which grow on less fertile soils seem to have more toxins than those growing on good soils. This could be one reason why koalas will eat only certain types of eucalypts and why they will sometimes even avoid them when they are growing on certain soils. The toxins are deactivated and the paste is digested by bacterial fermentation in a greatly enlarged caecum which is 2 metres (6 feet 6 inches) long, the longest of any mammals.",
            "habitat": "Koalas prefer eucalyptus forests, coastal regions and moist woodlands. They spend most of their time up in the trees sitting on branches either napping or eating the leaves.",
            "diet": "A Koalas diet consists almost entirely of eucalyptus leaves. The average Koala can eat 500 grams of eucalyptus leaves per day, chewing them to a fine paste with their sharp teeth and powerful jaws before swallowing. Koalas eat a wide range of eucalyptus leaves (12 species) and will also eat other leaf species such as Acacia, Mistletoe, Box Leaves and Leptospermum.Koalas only need to drink when they are ill or when there is a lack of moisture during droughts as 90% of their moisture comes from the plants they eat. (As mentioned above). Koalas also may swallow some soil to obtain minerals and nutrients.",
            "behaviour": "Koalas are nocturnal animals and are arboreal which means they live in trees. Some Koalas are mainly solitary animals, except for the breeding season and tend not to congregate in large groups. Most live in societies and are in contact with other Koalas. It is because of this they need to have areas of suitable eucalyptus forests which are large enough to support a healthy koala population and to allow for expansion by maturing young koalas. When approaching a tree to climb, koalas spring from the ground and catch their front claws in the bark, then bound upwards. Claw marks are usually visible on the trunks of trees regularly used as home trees by koalas.When descending a tree, koalas come down bottom first. They regularly descend to the ground to change trees and it is there that they are most vulnerable to predators such as dogs, foxes and dingoes. On the ground they walk awkwardly on all-fours and can also run. Koalas have sometimes been observed swimming, but this is rare.Koalas use a range of sounds to communicate with one another over relatively large distances and the male koala has a very loud call during the breeding season which can be heard over a kilometre away. Mother Koalas and their babies make soft clicking, squeaking sounds and gentle humming or murmuring sounds to one another, as well as gentle grunts to signal displeasure or annoyance.All koalas share one common call which is produced when they are afraid. It sounds like a human baby crying and made when the Koalas are under stress and threatened. It is often accompanied by shaking. Koalas also communicate by scent marking their trees.Koalas have a very slow metabolism just like Sloths and Wombats which makes them rest for up to 18 hours a day. They are asleep for most of this time. The remainder of the time is used for feeding, moving around, grooming and social interaction. A disturbed Koala can become violent and with their sharp teeth and claws can cause injury to a human.",
            "reproduction": "Female Koalas reach sexual maturity at 2 \u2013 3 years of age. Males reach maturity later at 3 \u2013 4 years. Mating occurs between the months of December and March, which is summertime in the Southern Hemisphere. Female Koalas produce one young joey each year and continue to breed for up to 12 years if they are healthy.Koala\u2019s are marsupials. A female Koalas gestation period is 35 days. Baby Koalas are very vulnerable at birth and are hairless, blind and have no ears. Baby Koalas are so tiny at birth and only measure around a quarter of an inch long. After birth, the joey will crawl into its mothers pouch located on its mothers belly and attach itself to one of her teats. It will stay in the pouch for around 6 months feeding on the milk from its mothers teat. After this time, the joey will begin to consume its mothers \u2018pap\u2019 which comes from the mothers cecum (beginning of the large intestine). Pap is a specialized form of droppings which is soft and runny. The \u2018pap\u2019 will pass on micro organisms from the mothers digestive system to prepare the joey\u2019s gut for the digestion of its future diet of eucalyptus leaves.The joey will remain with its mother for another 6 months, riding on her back and feeding on both milk and eucalyptus leaves until it is fully weaned at 12 months of age. Females usually leave their mothers, however, males will remain with their mother until they are 2 \u2013 3 years old. The life span of a Koala is up to 18 years.",
            "conservation status": "The IUCN lists the Koala as \u2018Least Concern\u2019. The Australian government does not consider the species to be threatened. However, in some parts of Australia such as New South Wales, Koalas are considered \u2018Vulnerable\u2019. Habitat loss, dog attacks and road accidents are all leading threats to the survival of the Koala. The Australian Koala Foundation is the principal organisation dedicated to the conservation of the koala and its habitat, mapping 40,000 kilometres squared (15,000 square miles) of land for koala habitat and claiming strong evidence that wild koala populations are in serious decline throughout the species natural range. The Australian Koala Foundation estimates there are around 100,000 koalas left in the wild."

            "desc": "The Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis) is a lizard species that is found on the islands (particularly the Komodo Island) in central Indonesia. The komodo dragon is a member of the monitor lizard family and is the largest living species of lizard. Because of their size and because there are no other carnivorous animals, these apex predators dominate the ecosystem in which they live.  Komodo Dragons grow to an average length of 2 \u2013 3 metres (6.5 \u2013 10 feet) and weigh around 70 kilograms (154 pounds). Captive komodo dragons may often weigh more, as much as 166 kilograms (365 pounds). Komodo dragons are the heaviest lizards on Earth. They have long, flat heads with rounded snouts, scaly skin, bowed legs and huge, muscular tails. They have about 60 frequently replaced serrated teeth that can measure up to 2.5 centimetres (1 inch) in length. Their saliva is frequently tinged with blood, because their teeth are almost completely covered by gingival tissue that is naturally lacerated during feeding. They also has a long, yellow, deeply-forked tongues. Their tongue is used to detect taste and smell as in many other reptiles and they can detect carrion from 4 \u2013 9.5 kilometres (2.5 \u2013 6 miles) away.",

They are able to see as far as 300 metres (985 feet), however, they have poor night vision. The Komodo Dragon is also able to see in color.The komodo dragons nostrils are not very good for smelling and it only has a few taste buds at the back of its throat. Their scales, some of which are reinforced with bone, have sensory plaques connected to nerves that facilitate their sense of touch. The scales around the ears, lips, chin and soles of the feet may have three or more sensory plaques.",
            "habitat": "The Komodo dragon prefers hot and dry places and typically lives in dry open grassland, savanna, scrubland and tropical forests at low elevations. Komodo dragons dig holes that can measure from 1 \u2013 3 metres (3 \u2013 10 feet) wide using their powerful forelimbs and claws.",
            "diet": "Komodo Dragons are carnivores and mainly feed up on carrion (dead animal carcasses). They also hunt and ambush prey such as invertebrates, mammals and birds. To catch prey that is out of reach, komodo dragons are able to stand on their hind legs and use their tails as support. They have also been known to use their tails to knock down large deer and pigs.Komodo dragons eat by tearing large chunks of flesh and swallowing them whole while holding the carcass down with their forelegs. Because of their slow metabolism, large dragons can survive on as little as 12 meals a year. Because the Komodo dragon does not have a diaphragm, it cannot suck water when drinking, nor can it lap water with its tongue. Instead, it drinks by taking a mouthful of water, lifting its head, and letting the water run down its throat. A komodo dragon can eat a whopping 80 percent of its body weight in a single feeding.",
            "behaviour": "Komodo Dragons are mostly active during the day but have shown some nocturnal behaviour. They are solitary animals that only come together to breed and eat. They are quite fast creatures and can move rapidly in brief sprints up to 20 kilometres per hour (12.4 miles per hour). Young komodo dragons can climb trees easily with the use of their strong claws.Because of their large size, Komodo Dragons are able to conserve body heat by sleeping in their burrows reducing their need to bask in the mornings. They typically hunt in the afternoons and stay in shaded areas during the hottest parts of the day.Although not strictly venomous, the bite of a Komodo Dragon is not just dangerous for the physical damage the Komodo is capable of causing, it is also heavily dosed with dangerous bacteria. If a victim is lucky enough to escape being eaten, because of the bacteria, it is likely to die eventually. A komodo dragon will follow its escapee until this happens (usually within a week), and then consume it.",
            "reproduction": "The Komodo Dragon breeding season occurs between May and August. Around 20 eggs are laid in September which are deposited in abandoned megapode nests (Megapode \u2013 stocky, medium-large chicken-like birds with small heads and large feet). Eggs are incubated for 7 \u2013 8 months, hatching in April the following year when insects are abundant. The young dwell in trees for safety as they are very vulnerable to predators and cannibalistic adult dragons.Komodo Dragons mature in about 3 \u2013 5 years. Komodo Dragons are capable of parthenogenesis (par-the-no-gen-e-sis), a form of reproduction in which an unfertilised egg develops into a new individual, occurring commonly among insects and certain other arthropods. Young Komodos will eat insects, eggs, geckos and small mammals. Komodo dragons may be monogamous and form pair bonds, a rare behaviour for lizards. The life span of the komodo dragon is over 30 years.",
            "conservation status": "The Komodo Dragon is classed as \u2018Vulnerable\u2019 by the IUCN. Komodo Dragons are protected under Indonesian law, and a national park, Komodo National Park, was founded to aid protection efforts. In the wild their range has contracted due to human activities. The largest risk to the survival of the Komodo Dragon is encroachment by humans, destruction of environment and poaching of prey such as the Sunda deer. There are approximately 4,000 \u2013 5,000 living Komodo dragons in the wild. Although attacks are very rare, Komodo dragons have been known to kill humans."

            "image": "https://animalcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/krill-340x200.png",
            "desc": "Krill are small crustaceans of the order Euphausiacea, and are found in all the world\u2019s oceans. They belong to the class Malacostraca, which contains some 40,000 species of crustaceans, and includes the superorder Eucarida comprising the three orders, Euphausiacea (krill), Decapoda (shrimp, prawns, lobsters, crabs), and the planktonic Amphionidacea. There are two families within the order Euphausiacea \u2014 Euphausiidae, which contains 10 different genera with a total of 85 species, and the Bentheuphausiidae, which has only one species, Bentheuphausia amblyops. This is a bathypelagic krill living in deep waters below 1,000 m (3,300 ft). It is considered the most primitive extant krill species. The name comes from the Norwegian word \u201ckrill\u201d, meaning \u201csmall fry of fish\u201d. The scientific name comes from the Latin and Greek term euphausia, meaning light or illumination. The name was probably given because of the creature\u2019s bioluminescent glow.",
            "lifespan": "The lifespan of krill depends on which ocean they live in. Those that occupy the warm tropical or subtropical waters live between six and eight months, whereas polar species live as long as six years if they can successfully evade predators.",
            "diet": "Krill are herbivorous or omnivorous in nature. They feed on small algae or microscopic animals such as phytoplankton and zooplankton that happen to pass by. A few species are exclusively carnivorous and supplement their diet with fish larvae.These small crustaceans are filter feeders and their frontmost appendages, the thoracopods, form very fine combs with which they can filter out their food from the water. They passively suck up the vast quantities of small food in the water.Krill are very important to the food chain. They convert the primary production of their prey into a form suitable for consumption by larger animals that cannot feed directly on the minuscule algae.",
            "behavior": "Krill are swarming animals. The sizes and densities of krill swarms vary by species and region, but some are so big that they can be seen on satellite images. For example, the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, swarms reach 10,000 to 60,000 individuals per cubic meter. This swarming behavior is to confuse predators, that would prefer to pick out individuals.They are also migratory animals, that follow diurnal vertical migration. They spend the day at greater depths and rise during the night toward the surface. The deeper they go, the more they reduce their activity, which reduces encounters with predators and conserves their energy. The vertical migration may happen to to three times a day.Swimming activity in krill varies with stomach fullness. Animals that had been feeding at the surface swim less actively and therefore sink below the mixed layer. As they sink they produce feces which implies a role in the Antarctic carbon cycle. Those with empty stomachs swim more actively and thus head towards the surface.Like all crustaceans, krill must molt in order to grow. Approximately every 13 to 20 days, they shed their chitinous exoskeleton and leave it behind as exuvia. Molt frequency can depend on the temperature of the water.",
            "reproduction": "The mating season for krill varies by species and climate. During the mating period, the male deposits a sperm sack at the female\u2019s genital opening. She can carry several thousand eggs in her ovary! They can have multiple broods in one season.There are two types of spawning mechanism for krill, depending on the species. The 57 species of the genera Bentheuphausia, Euphausia, Meganyctiphanes, Thysanoessa, and Thysanopoda are \u201cbroadcast spawners\u201d. This means the female releases the fertilised eggs into the water, where they usually sink, disperse, and are on their own. The remaining 29 species of the other genera are \u201csac spawners\u201d, where the female carries the eggs with her, attached to the rearmost pairs of thoracopods until they hatch.After hatching from the eggs, the young will pass through several larval stages. In the early stages, the undeveloped krill lack the appropriate feeding apparatuses and survive almost exclusively on the egg yolk. In later stages, they develop a mouth and digestive system for consuming plankton. Each stage requires them to replace their entire exoskeleton through a series of molts. After the final stage of molt, they reach sexual maturity.\u00a0Location and HabitatThese small crustaceans occur in all oceans across the world, all the way from the Arctic to Antarctica, including both coastal and deepwater regions. Different species are found in different oceans. For example Pacific krill occur in the Pacific, while Northern krill occur across the Atlantic from the Mediterranean Sea northward. The Antarctic krill is found in the Antarctic waters, and commonly lives at depths reaching 100 m (330 ft). Bathypelagic krill live in deep waters below 1,000 m (3,300 ft).Krill Conservation StatusThese creatures are not considered to be under threat from population loss. The total number of the worldwide krill population is truly staggering. It is estimated that the entire biomass of the Antarctic krill alone (meaning the total mass of every member of the species put together) is between 125 million and six billion tons, among the largest in the animal kingdom. This would mean there are trillions of individuals!Despite this, it is thought that the population of this species may have fallen some 80% since the 1970s due to climate change, disease, and krill fishing. They are extremely important to the ocean\u2019s ecosystem and are a source of food for many animals.These small crustaceans are eaten by humans, and are particularly harvested in the Southern Ocean and around Japan. They are a rich source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids. They are eaten in Southeast Asia, where they are fermented or ground finely to make shrimp paste. The liquid from fermentation is also used as fish sauce. They are also used for dietary supplements, dog food, livestock.",
            "threats and predators": "Krill are a very important element in the aquatic food chain. As a food source, they connect the microscopic marine organisms at the bottom of the chain to the much larger predators at the top. Many animals feed on krill, ranging from smaller animals like fish or penguins to larger ones like seals, sea-birds (especially penguins) and baleen whales, including the blue whale.When approached by a predator, they can make a hasty escape by swimming rapidly backwards at a pace of around 10 body lengths per second. This is trick known as lobstering.They can be affected by disease, loss of prey and climate change. They are caught frequently in some fishery locations, too. Because of the large role they play in the ocean, disturbances to their populations can have a wider effect on the marine ecosystem, because this species makes up so many animals diet. This means loss of tiny krill could harm even some of the largest animals in our oceans.\u00a0"

Ladybirds are small insects, ranging from 1 millimetre to 10 millimetres (0.04 to 0.4 inches) and are commonly yellow, orange or scarlet with small black spots on their wing covers, with black legs, head and antennae. There are over 100 species of ladybirds in europe, of which 40 species are resident in the British Isles. The most common ladybirds are the two-spot ladybird (Adalia bipunctata) and the larger seven-spot ladybird (Coccinella septempunctata). The number of spots on a ladybird determines what kind of ladybird it is. The two-spot ladybird has very similar habits to the seven-spot ladybird.

They have even been known to catch venomous snakes much larger than themselves.Like all kingfishers, laughing kookaburras employ a \u2018sit and wait\u2019 technique of hunting. They catch their prey by waiting patiently for prey to pass by and then swooping down from their high perches and grabbing their food and crushing it in their strong beaks.Small prey is eaten whole, however, larger prey is killed by being bashed against the ground or a tree probably to tenderise the meat. The kookaburra does not drink any water as it gets enough water from the food it eats.\u00a0",
            "behaviour": "Laughing Kookaburras spend most of their day perched in high branches overlooking rainforest clearings watching for prey.

Being a common sight in suburban and urban areas, laughing kookaburras will even eat out of a human hand.",
            "reproduction": "Breeding occurs around October and November, however, if breeding fails, laughing kookaburras will continue mating into the summer months. Mating rituals are similar to those of the Wattle Bird whereby, the female adopts a begging positon and calls like a young bird. The males offers her his latest catch accompanied with a \u2018oo oo oo\u2019 sound. Breeding pairs may pair for life.Kookaburra nests are often tree hollows or excavated out of arboreal termite nests. The birds use their strong heads and beaks to crack dents into the hard exterior of the nest, continuing until they have constructed a hole for the female to lay her eggs and rear the chicks inside.The female kookaburra lays around 3 eggs at 2 day intervals. Eggs are incubated for around 29 days. Hatchlings are born blind and practically naked. Their eyes may not open completely until the bird is nearly 3 weeks old. The parents feed the chicks a diet primarily of insects, as they remain within the burrow for a full month. When they finally leave the nest they are already able to fly.Kookaburra chicks have a hook on their upper mandible which disappears by the time they fledge. If food supplies are scarce, the 3rd egg will be smaller than the first 2 eggs thereby producing a smaller 3rd chick. Their hooks can be used as a weapon during sibling rivalry and it is most likely that the smaller chick will be attacked by its siblings and killed as the fight for food ensues. When food is abundant, parents are able to spend more time with the chicks and feed them more which prevents the chicks from fighting.Juvenile Kookabuuras tend to remain in family groups in their home territory for around 4 years after birth. They stay to help their parents hunt and care for the next generation of chicks. Their parents give them incubation and brooding duties. The young kookaburras also supply new nestlings with over half their food intake. Laughing kookaburras are able to mate at around 12 months old.The life span of the Laughing Kookaburra is around 15 \u2013 20 years.\u00a0",

They are subniveal animals (living in a zone that is in or under the snow layer) and together with the voles and muskrats, they make up the subfamily Arvicolinae. Lemmings are distributed throughout the tundra, alpine and mountain heaths of Scandinavia and Russia. The Norway Lemming (Lemmus lemmus), of Scandinavia is best known for its mass migration behaviour.  Lemmings measure around 13 \u2013 18 centimetres (5 \u2013 7 inches) in length and weigh around 23 \u2013 34 grams (0.05 \u2013 0.07 pounds).

They have a flattened claw on their first digit of their front feet which helps them to dig in the snow.",
            "lemming habitat": "In a typical year, these rodents live in tunnel systems beneath the snow in winter which protects them from predators. Their underground burrows have rest areas, bathrooms and nesting rooms. Lemmings make nests out of grasses, feathers and musk ox wool. In the spring, they move to higher ground where they live on mountain heaths or in forests, continuously breeding before returning in Autumn to the Alpine zone.",
            "lemming diet": "Lemmings are herbivores with a main diet of moss and grass. They also forage through the snow surface to find berries, leaves, shoots, roots, bulbs and lichen. Like other rodents, their incisors are continuously growing which means they are able to munch upon much tougher food.",
            "lemming behaviour": "Lemmings migrate sporadically every few years when their is a population explosion. During mild winters, early springs and late autumns when food is abundant, reproduction is fast and survival of litters is high resulting in a summer soaring of Lemming numbers.Lemmings are often wrongly said to commit mass suicide by jumping off cliffs. What does happen is, when populations increase, pressure can trigger mass migration, usually away from the heaths towards the forests. Obstacles in their paths, such as boulders, rivers, cliffs or ravines may force the Lemmings into a \u2018bottleneck\u2019 situation and with space being difficult to find causes the Lemmings to panic and take reckless flight. The young are more vulnerable and are pushed away from the best habitats down mountains and into valleys. Lemmings are good swimmers when they have to be, however, they do not know their limits. During dispersal, young lemmings often try to cross large bodies of water, drowning in the process. It is this bizarre behaviour which gave rise to the misconception that these rodents kill themselves.Lemmings spend most of their time during the Scandinavian summers in their under ground tunnel systems, however, when the ground begins to freeze in Autumn, they cannot dig through the ice to forage for food and are forced to forage on the surface. Because of these complex tunnel systems, Lemmings do not have to hibernate, even during the harshest Scandinavian winters. The tunnels keep them out of sight from hungry predators such as Great Grey Owls which are heavily reliant on Lemmings as a source of food.Lemmings, like other rodents, prefer to live in groups, however, some can be solitary and only come together to breed and migration purposes.",
            "lemming reproduction": "Lemmings mature at 5 \u2013 6 weeks of age. They are prolific breeders and may produce 8 litters of up to 6 young each throughout the summer. The gestation period of the female Lemming is 20 days.The life span of a lemming is less than 2 years.",

Like all other lemurs, it is found only on the island of Madagascar and the Comoros Islands off of the East Coast of Africa. Although threatened by habitat destruction and therefore listed as \u2018vulnerable\u2019 by the IUCN Red List, the Ring-tailed Lemur is the most populous lemur in zoos worldwide as they reproduce readily in captivity.",
            "characteristics": "Rainforest Lemurs are mostly grey with white underparts. Lemurs have a slender frame, a narrow face that is white with black patches around the eyes and a black fox-like muzzle. The lemur can easily be recognised by its long, bushy tail that is ringed with twenty six black and white rings. Lemurs tails always begin with a white stripe and ends with a black one. Their tails are longer than their bodies at up to 56 centimetres (22 inches) in length.The Lemur has hind limbs longer than their forelimbs and the palms and soles are padded with soft, leathery skin. Their fingers are slender and semi-dexterous (semi-skillful) with flat, human-like nails. Lemurs have one claw, known as a \u2018toilet claw\u2019 (a comb-like claw), on the second toe of each hind limb specialized for grooming purposes. These primates also groom orally by licking and tooth-scraping with narrow, horizontal lower incisors and canines, called a \u2018tooth comb\u2019.Lemurs eyes are a bright yellow or orange color, which stay the same color from the time they are born. Adults may reach a body length of 46 centimetres (18 inches) and a weight of 5.5 kilograms (12 pounds).",
            "communication": "Lemurs use their sense of smell to communicate with each other. Lemurs have scent glands on their behinds and on their feet that leave odours on surfaces they encounter. When other lemurs pass by, they smell those odours and can tell that another lemur has been there. Lemurs have big, bushy tails that they wave in the air as another form of communication.

When available, tamarind can make up as much as 50% of the Lemurs diet yearly. The Lemur is also known to eat flowers, herbs, bark and sap. Additionally, it has been observed eating decayed wood, earth, insects and small vertebrates.",
            "habitat": "Lemurs have several different habitats on Madagascar ranging from rainforests to dry areas of the island. They inhabit deciduous forests with grass floors or forests along riverbanks (gallery forests). Some also inhabit wet, closed brush where few trees grow. The Lemur is thought to require primary forest (forests which have remained undisturbed by human activity) in order to survive. Such forests are now being cleared at an alarming rate.",
            "behaviour": "The Lemur is diurnal (an animal that is active during the daytime and rests during the night) and inhabits both the ground (terrestrial) and the trees (arboreal) and forms troops of up to 25 individuals. Social hierarchies are determined by sex.Females have a distinct hierarchy and socially dominate males in all circumstances, including feeding priority. Males tend to be confined to a lower or outer limit of group activity and will alternate between troops approximately every 3 years. Lemur troops claim sizable territories which may overlap with those of other troops. Up to 5.6 kilometres (3.5 miles) of this territory may be covered in a single days foraging.Lemurs are very vocal animals. Around fifteen distinct vocalizations are used to maintain group togetherness during foraging and alert group members to the presence of a predator or threat. Male and female lemurs scent mark with their genital regions, they also possess scent glands on their wrists and on the surface of their shoulders.These glands secrete a greasy substance which is used to mark territories and maintain group dominance hierarchies. Males also possess a thorny spur on each wrist that are scraped against tree trunks to create grooves lubricated with their scent.In displays of aggression, males will engage in a social display behaviour called \u2018stink fighting\u2019 which involves covering their tails with scent from their glands and then waving the scented tail at male rivals. Males will also occasionally wave their scented tails at females as a form of courtship. This usually results in the female cuffing or biting the male. Despite being primarily quadrupedal (four-footed), the Lemur can rear up and balance on its hind legs, usually for aggressive displays.In the mornings, Lemurs usually bask to warm themselves. They face the sun, sitting in what is frequently described as a \u2018sun-worshipping\u2019 posture or \u2018Lotus position\u2019. However, they sit with their legs extended outward, not cross-legged and will often support themselves on nearby branches. Basking is often a group activity.",
            "reproduction": "The Lemur breeding season runs from April to June, with the female in oestrus (the period of heat) for approximately 24 \u2013 48 hours. Gestation (pregnancy) lasts for about 146 days (2 \u2013 5 months), resulting in a birth of either one or two offspring. The young lemurs begin to eat solid food after two months and are fully weaned after five months.When lemurs are born, they are carried in their mothers mouths until they are old enough to hang on to her fur by themselves. Males reach sexual maturity at two and a half years of age and females at nineteen and a half months. Most lemurs live for about eighteen years.",
            "predators": "Lemurs have both natural and introduced predators. Native predators include the Fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), Madagascar Harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus), Madagascar Buzzard (Buteo brachypterus) and the Madagascar Ground Boa (Acrantophis madagascariensis). Introduced predators include the Small Indian Civet (Viverricula indica), domestic cats, domestic dogs and humans.When threatened, the Lemur has been known to strike out with its short nails in a behaviour termed \u2018jump fighting\u2019. This action is extremely rare outside of the breeding season when tensions are high and competition for access to mates is intense. Only one attack on a human by a Lemur has ever been documented in the United States.",
            "conservation status": "Lemurs are endangered species or threatened species. Many species went extinct in the last centuries, mainly due to habitat destruction (deforestation) and hunting.Lemurs play an important role in the ecology of Madagascar and the Comores Islands, because they disperse seeds from the fruit they eat. These seeds can then grow into new plants, which is important because the forests of Madagascar are being destroyed at a very high rate.People in Madagascar cut down the forests there to use the wood, and to grow agricultural crops in its place. In fact, eighty percent of the lemurs original habitat in Madagascar has been destroyed. Although the lemurs themselves help to disperse seeds for new plants, they cannot keep up with the people that cut the forests down.Although conservation efforts are under way, options are limited because of the lemurs limited range and because of Madagascar\u2019s economic situation. There are 85 living lemur species accounted for in current publications, with more documentation currently awaiting publication.One of the foremost lemur research facilities is the \u2018Duke University Lemur Centre\u2019."

        "Leopard Seal": {
            "image": "https://animalcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Leopard-Seal-4384015-340x200.jpg",
            "desc": "The leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx), also referred to as the sea leopard, is the second largest species of seal in the Antarctic. It is only smaller than the southern elephant seal, and is the only member of the genus Hydrurga. Together with the Ross seal, the crabeater seal and the Weddell seal, it forms the tribe of Lobodontini seals. The leopard seal was first described by French zoologist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1820. The name of the seal\u2019s genus, hydrurga, means \u201cwater worker\u201d and leptonyx in its scientific name is the Greek for \u201cthin-clawed\u201d. This seal eats a wide range of prey including cephalopods, other seals, sharks, krill, birds and fish. Its only predator is the killer whale. The leopard seal is a solitary animal throughout most of its life, and is known for being quite aggressive. They are very vocal animals, and can \u201csing\u201d underwater which helps them to find a mate during the breeding season.",
            "lifespan": "In the wild, leopard seals have a relatively long lifespan considering the conditions they live in, and can live up to 26 years old.",
            "diet": "The leopard seal eats a variety of different foods. While younger leopard seals eat mostly krill, squid and fish, with krill often making up 45% of their diet, adult leopard seals eat various penguin species and seal species.The most common penguin species taken by the leopard seal are the king, Ad\u00e9lie, rockhopper, gentoo, emperor and chinstrap penguins.While the common seal species are the Weddell, crabeater, Ross, and young southern elephant seals. The leopard seal will also occasionally take fur seal pups.Leopard seals eat krill by suction, straining them through their grooved teeth. However, when hunting penguins, these seals do not possess the right teeth necessary to slice their prey into manageable pieces. To get around this, they flail the prey from side to side until it tears and rips into smaller pieces. These two different methods of eating prey show how adaptable the leopard seal is to their environment, and shows how they likely survive so long in the harsh waters.When hunting penguins, the seals swim around the waters near the edges of the ice, almost completely submerged, waiting for the penguins to enter the water. It grabs the penguins by its feet, and then vigorously shakes and beats the penguin against the surface of the water repeatedly until the penguin is dead.Leopard seals are primarily shallow divers but they do dive deeper than 80 meters in search for food. They are able to complete these dives by collapsing their lungs and re-inflating them at the surface.",
            "behavior": "Leopard seals are primarily solitary creatures, except during mating and nursing. Outside of these times, where they spend more time on the ice, they spend the majority of their time in the water. They use their large fore flippers to help propel themselves through the water at speeds of up to 40 kph (25 mph).While the ends of a leopard seal\u2019s mouth are permanently curled upward, creating the illusion of a smile, leopard seals are actually known for being quite aggressive. They have even been known to kill humans.Young penguins seals can often play with their food. They may seek out penguins or young seals, and, as the penguin or seal swims to the shore, the leopard seal will cut them off and chase them back into the water. They may do this over and over again until the penguin successfully makes it to shore or succumbs to exhaustion. Scientists do not know the reason for the leopard seals doing this, especially as they may not even eat the animal, but it is thought this might be so the young seals can sharpen their hunting skills.",
            "vocalizations": "Vocalization are also thought to be important in leopard seal breeding, since males are much more vocal around this time. Around the austral summer, males produce loud calls (153 to 177\u2009dB re 1\u2009\u03bcPa at 1\u2009m) for many hours each day. They hang upside down and rock from side to side under the water while singing. Their singing can be split into two categories: vocalizing and silencing, in which vocalizing is when they are making noises underwater, and silencing noted as the breathing period at the air surface.Scientists have identified five distinctive sounds that male leopard seals make, which include: the high double trill, medium single trill, low descending trill, low double trill, and a hoot with a single low trill. These are thought to be for both territorial and breeding purposes.Females will often use vocal calls to signal to their young, particularly if they have just got back from a forage for food.",
            "reproduction": "Little is known about leopard seal reproduction, because they live in areas in which humans do not reside. Leopard seals are polygynous, meaning that males mate with multiple females during the mating period. The mating period usually takes place from December to January, shortly after the pups from the previous season are weaned when the female seal is in estrus.Mating takes place in the water. After breeding takes place, the implantation of the fertilized egg can be delayed by up to three months, ensuring the pup will be born in the spring or early summer when it is more likely to survive. This process is known as delayed implantation or embryonic diapause, and it is common in seal species. The gestation period is usually around 274 days.Pups are born on ice floes and kept in small snow holes that the female leopard seals dig out during their pregnancy. Here the mother nurses the pup and eventually teaches it how to hunt in the water.Leopard seal pups weigh around 66 pounds at birth and are usually weaned from their mother at around 6 months old. The male plays no part in raising the young.Female leopard seals reach sexual maturity before males, between the age of three and seven, while males reach sexual maturity between six and seven. Females usually produce one pup per year.\u00a0Leopard Seal Location and HabitatLeopard seals are predominately found in the circumpolar region of the Antarctic ice pack, between 50\u02daS and 80\u02daS. They are pagophilic (\u201cice-loving\u201d) and most leopard seals remain within the pack ice throughout the year. They may also be seen on the subantarctic islands if there is enough ice substrate.Matrilineal groups made up of mothers and pups often move further north in the austral winter to sub-antarctic islands and the coastlines of the southern continents to provide care for their pups.Leopard seals are seen much more often in the water than they are on land. Their prey is often in the surface waters of the ocean, so this is primarily where they reside.Leopard Seal Conservation StatusLeopard seals are listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Their population is thought to be between 220,000 and 440,000 individuals and, because they are an apex predator, they are nor really threatened in their environment. The biggest threat to these animals is climate change and global warming, and changes to their habitat as a result of this.",
            "predators": "Leopard seals are apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain. The only predator they have is the killer whale, although very few leopard seals are actually eaten by these whales.",
            "importance": "As an apex predator, the leopard seal is very important to its ecosystem. It helps to keep populations of other animals in check by feeding on them.\u00a0Tribe Of Lobodontini SealsAlongside the leopard seal, the other members of the true seal tribe Lobodontini, known collectively as the antarctic seals or lobodontin seals, are the Ross seal, the crabeater seal and the Weddell seal.The Ross SealThe Ross seal (Ommatophoca rossii) is the only species of the genus Ommatophoca and is the smallest, least abundant and least well known of the Antarctic pinnipeds. It is characterized by its disproportionately large eyes which can measure up to 7 cm in diameter, which is where it gets its name from.Ross seals are brachycephalic, as they have a short broad muzzle and have the shortest fur of any other seal. They reach a length of about 1.68 to 2.09 m (5.5 to 6.9 ft) and weight of 129 to 216 kg (284 to 476 lb). They are colored dark-brown in the dorsal area and silvery-white beneath.They eat primarily squid and fish and are preyed on by killer whales and leopard seals.The Ross seal is relatively unknown and is considered to be the least common pack ice seal. Its population is estimated to be around 130,000 individuals. It almost never leaves the Antarctic Ocean, with the very rare exception of stray animals found around subantarctic islands.The Crabeater SealThe crabeater seal (Lobodon carcinophaga), also known as the krill-eater seal, is the most abundant seal species in the world. They are estimated to be as many as 75 million individuals in Antarctica.Its scientific name translated as \u201clobe-toothed (lobodon) crab eater (carcinophaga)\u201d, refers specifically to the finely lobed teeth adapted to filtering their small crustacean prey, which is thought to be the reason for their success and abundance in their environment. Despite their name, crabeater seals do not eat crabs. They are preyed on by leopard seals.Crabeater seals measure an average length of 2.3 m (7.5 ft) and weigh an average of around 200 kg (440 lb). These seals are covered mostly by brown or silver fur, with darker coloration around their flippers. The color fades throughout the year, and recently molted seals appear darker than the silvery-white crabeater seals that are about to molt. Their bodies are generally more slender than other seals, and their snout is pointed.Crabeaters are the most gregarious of the Antarctic seals and have been seen in swimming groups of several hundred individuals.The Weddell SealThe Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii) measures about 2.5 to 3.5 m (8 ft 2 in to 11 ft 6 in) long and weigh 400 to 600 kg (880 to 1,320 lb) and have a bulky body and short fore flippers relative to their body length. This seal varies from bluish-black to dark gray dorsally and to light gray/silver ventrally, and grows a thin fur coat around its whole body except for small areas around the flippers.Weddell seals are named when it was discovered in the 1820s during expeditions led by British sealing captain James Weddell to the area of the Southern Ocean now known as the Weddell Sea.They eat an array of fish, bottom-feeding prawns, cephalopods and crustaceans, and hunt in different parts of the water column depending on prey availability. They have also been known to hunt seals. At sea or on pack ice, they are prey for killer whales and leopard seals, which prey primarily on juveniles and pups.\u00a0"

            "desc": "The leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis) is a large tortoise found in the savannas of eastern and southern Africa, from Sudan to the southern Cape. This tortoise is named after its interesting and attractive shell markings, which often resemble the pattern of a leopard. The leopard tortoise is the only member of the genus Stigmochelys, although in the past, it was commonly placed in Geochelone. It belongs to the family Testudinidae and the order Testudines. Stigmochelys is a combination of Greek words: stigma meaning \u201cmark\u201d or \u201cpoint\u201d and chelone meaning \u201ctortoise\u201d. The specific name pardalis is from the Latin word pardus meaning \u201cleopard\u201d. These animals have a herbivorous diet eat a variety of mixed grasses, as well as succulents and thistles, and prefers semiarid, thorny to grassland habitats.",
            "lifespan": "The leopard tortoise has the ability to live for up to 100 years! These animals are becoming more and more popular as pets, but people are reminded of their long lifespan before taking them into their home.",
            "diet": "Leopard tortoises are herbivores and their diet consists of a range of different plants, including forbs, thistles, grasses, and succulents. Any seeds they eat are passed undigested through the gut, which means the leopard tortoise plays a significant role in seed dispersal. These animals may also gnaw on bones or even hyena feces to obtain calcium, necessary for bone development and their eggshells.They have no teeth (no turtle or tortoise does), but they bite and rip at food with their hard, sharp, beak-like mouths. Leopard tortoises also eat the fruit and pads of prickly pear cactus and other succulents that provide them with water. They store water in large anal sacs that take up most of the space in their abdominal cavities. This is an important physical adaptation to their arid environment.",
            "behavior": "The leopard tortoise is active during the day, early in the morning and just before the sun goes down, when the temperature is most moderate. They seek shelter during the hottest part of the day and go to sleep early to avoid the cold.When they are awake, they spend most of their time eating. While they do not have ears, they can sense vibrations that help them navigate their environment and also have a very strong sense of smell to help them locate food.When it comes to finding a den or a place to shelter, they do not dig or create these themselves. They often take over in abandoned dense of other animals. The leopard tortoise does not dig other than to make nests in which to lay eggs.Leopard tortoises are known for their hissing noises. When feeling threatened, tortoises quickly pull the head and feet into the shell, resulting in air being forced from the lungs and thus the distinctive hissing noise is produced. They are relatively solitary animals, and there is no evidence to suggest that these tortoises communicate with each other very much",
            "reproduction": "Leopard tortoises breed from May to October. These animals are monogamous and both males and females become increasingly aggressive when searching for a mate. Males vocalize species-specific calls in an attempt to attract females. Males also vocalize during competition for mates. Male vocalizations include a variety of grunts and groans. Both sexes will butt and ram rivals.During the mating season, male tortoises follow females for days or even weeks at a time before initiating courtship. In order to initiate contact, males bite the female on the head or feet.After mating, females dig a hole in the ground, ranging from 100 to 300 mm deep, in which to lay her eggs. She will lay between 5 and 7 clutches in a season, with each clutch separated from the previous by about 3 to 4 weeks. Clutches range from 5 to 30 eggs, which are white and spherical. The gestation period ranges from 9 to 12 months and varies according to location, temperature, and precipitation.Leopard tortoises don\u2019t exactly raise their young. Males leave directly after copulation and, once the female has laid her eggs and covered them, she leaves too.Once the baby leopard tortoises have hatched, they are immediately independent. They immediately start to feed on a variety of plants, but seem to prefer succulents, possibly because of the higher water content. Leopard tortoise young are usually marked with black blotches, spots, or even dashes and stripes on a yellow background.\u00a0",
            "location and habitat": "Leopard tortoises are endemic to Africa and they are found across eastern and southern Africa, extending from South Sudan and Somalia, across East Africa, to South Africa and Namibia.Over this range, the leopard tortoise occupies the most varied habitats of any African tortoise, including grasslands, thorn-scrub, mesic bushland, and savannas. They can be found at altitudes ranging from sea level to 2,900 m (9,500 ft).The leopard tortoise is well adapted to the semi-arid conditions of the savannah, and do not tolerate damp or cold well. As with all arid regions, the African savannah experiences extreme temperature fluctuations over a 24-hour period. It gets very hot during the day when the sun is burning brightest, but cools off considerably when the sun goes down. During this time, they will seek shelter under various low lying plants, or may seek refuge in abandoned fox, jackal, or aardvark holes.Leopard Tortoise Conservation StatusThe leopard tortoise is a widespread tortoise, the most widespread tortoise in sub-Saharan Africa, and is well populated over its range. It is currently listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Humans are the biggest threat to these animals, with agricultural burning, consumption, and commercial exploitation in the pet trade being the biggest dangers. However, these activities have yet to cause major decline in the tortoise species\u2019 population.Leopard tortoises are being bred increasingly in captivity for the pet trade, but these animals can be difficult to keep as a pet. They are very large and don\u2019t like to handled. Also, not to mention, they can live for up to 100 years \u2014 and may well outlive their owner!",
            "predators": "In the wild, leopard tortoises are not really preyed on by other animals. Their thick, heavy shells means they are difficult to capture, and their coloring means they are camouflaged well. Hatchlings, however, are easy prey to animals such as foxes, coyotes and mongooses. Nearly 80% of leopard tortoise hatchlings are eaten by prey.Adult leopard tortoises are preyed on by humans. They are taken for creating medicine, tools, and are often used as a source of food.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

        "Lion": {
            "image": "https://animalcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lion-1-340x200.jpg",
            "desc": "The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera and belongs to the family Felidae, along with tigers, leopards and jaguars. It is native to Africa and India and is the second largest cat in the world, following the tiger. While once found throughout much of Africa, Asia and Europe, lions are presently encountered in the wild only in Africa and in the Gir Forest of India (where it is found only in the Sasan-Gir National Park). A lions main habitats are open woodlands, savannas, scrub country and grassy plains. Lions are known for their huge bodies and manes, and their social groups known as prides. One of the strongest felines in the world, they are apex predators and keystone predators, meaning they are extremely important in the food chain and have a large effect on the environment around them.",
            "lifespan": "Lions usually live for 10 to 14 years in the wild, and for 20 to 25 years in captivity.",
            "diet": "Lions are generalist carnivores, meaning they are able to thrive in a wide variety of environmental conditions and can make use of a variety of different resources. They are also called hyper-carnivores because meat makes more than 70% part of their diet. An adult male lion requires an average amount of 7 kg of meat per day to survive, although they could eat up to 43 kg! Females could eat up to 25 kg a day.Their prey usually consists of mammals weighing between 190\u2013550 kg (420\u20131,210 lbs) such as zebras, wildebeest and antelopes. They\u2019ll also eat giraffe, buffalo, gazelle and warthog, and young elephant, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus. In times of shortage, they also catch and eat a variety of smaller animals, like rodents and reptiles. Lions also steal kills from hyenas, leopards and other predators.Lions are both apex predators and keystone predators. As an apex predator, lions reside at the top of the food chain and no other creatures prey on them. As a keystone predator, they are very important in regulating the population of other animals in their environment. Without them in the ecosystem, the populations of the species that they prey upon would explode uncontrollably, which can cause detrimental impacts to the ecological community.The majority of the hunting in a pride of lions is done by the females. They work together as a group to trap and capture prey they would otherwise not be able to get while hunting on their own. When lions hunt, they rely heavily on their teeth to grab prey, suffocating the animal or collapsing its trachea. Because of this constant use, about 40 percent of African lions have dental injuries.Lions do not have great stamina, and they only run fast in short bursts. This means that they need to be close to their prey before starting the attack. Generally, they have a relatively low hunting success rate.That being said, they are determined animals. While they don\u2019t enjoy water, they are great swimmers and will chase their prey into and across water if they have to.Once the prey has been caught, the females will allow the male lion to eat first before eating themselves. The cubs are at the bottom of the pile and have to be content with what remains once the adults have finished.Contrary to popular belief, lions do not hunt humans! Lions can actually form bonds with humans under certain circumstances.",
            "behavior": "Generally, big cats are solitary animals. However, lions are the exception to this. Lions live in groups known as \u201cprides\u201d, which can contain as many as 40 lions. However, some lions of both sexes become nomads and prefer to live alone.While not quite as rapid as the cheetah which can reach speeds of 70 mph, a lion can achieve a land speed of 50 mph for short distances. They have an amazing jump, and have been recorded springing as far as 36 feet. They can also climb extremely well, and are capable of climbing vertical tree trunks with ease.Despite being very strong and often active, lions spend much of the day sleeping! In fact, the average amount of time they spend moving is two hours a day, and they can sleep for up to 20 hours a day! This is because they do not have many sweat glands so in order to conserve energy, they will lie about and rest. They are more active at night when it is cooler, although they do most of their hunting during the day.",
            "prides": "On average, a lion pride contains around 10 to 15 lions, mainly compromised of related females; adults, sub-adults (between the ages of 2 and 4) and cubs, plus one or more resident males. The maximum number of adult male lions in a pride is 4.Female cubs will stay with the pride as they grow older. When they reach sexual maturity, at about 2 years old, they will be hunters for the pride. Young male lions get kicked out of the pride by older males at the same age. These young males then live and roam in small groups (often with brothers and cousins), until they find another pride that they could take over and breed with females. This will often lead to fights with existing males in the pride.When a male lion takes over a pride, it can kill all the lion cubs to bring the pride\u2019s females into heat again, allowing them to breed and raise their own cubs. However, male lions become a member of the pride because the females accept them as the pride male. They will usually only be able to remain the pride male 3 to 5 years in the wild, as lionesses can turn on and kill older previously dominant males in a pride.The job of a male in a pride is not only reproduction, but also protection. They guard their territory and keep out other pride and predators that might affect the food supply of their pride. Male lions patrol a territory of around 100m\u00b2, marking trees and rocks with urine and roaring to warn off intruders.The abundance of prey availability plays a significant role in the size of a lion pride. While females usually stay in their mother\u2019s pride for life, food scarcity can force them out.Asiatic lion prides differ from the African lion prides, and Asiatic lions actually divide themselves into two prides. Male Asiatic lions are solitary or associate with up to only three other males to form a loose pride. Females associate with up to 12 females to form a stronger pride together with their cubs. Female and male Asiatic lions usually associate only for a few days during the mating season, and very rarely travel or feed together.",
            "reproduction and cubs": "Both male and female lions become sexually mature between the ages of two and three, and by the age of four, most females have reproduced. They usually give birth to 2 to 3 cubs at a time and can give birth to a litter every two years. The the gestation period is quite short, around four months or 110 days.Lionesses are polyestrous, meaning they can go into heat several times per year. The females in a group of lions typically give birth at about the same time. This allows for the young lions to play and grow up together with support from the entire pride.When a cub is born, the process is kept secret. The pregnant lioness will give birth to a cub away from the rest of the pride and will proceed to hide the young from everyone else for the following six weeks. It is thought they do this to protect the cubs from intruding male lions and other predators.As a newborn, a lion cub only weighs between 2.6 and 4.6 pounds (1.2 to 2.1 kg). Lion cubs are born blind and their eyes open around seven days after birth. They are yellowish-red in color and can look like a domestic cat. They\u2019re also usually covered in darker spots that help to camouflage them in their den to protect them whilst the adults have gone out to hunt.As lions are mammals, the females nurse their cubs for about 6 to 7 months. The cubs are totally dependent on their mothers for the initial 3 months of their lives, and after 3 months they start eating meat. A mother does not integrate herself and her cubs back into the pride until the cubs are six to eight weeks old, and, while they are in this period, she will move her cubs to a new den site several times a month to avoid predators, carrying each lion cub, one by one, by the nape of their neck.Young cubs begin to participate in pride kills at 11 months. Unfortunately, less than half of cubs make it to be a year old and four out of five have died by the time they are two, generally either from animal attacks or starvation.That being said, lionesses are not only caring towards their own young, but if a cub is neglected in any way, a lioness will allow it to suckle in an effort to help the cub survive.",
            "\u2019s roar": "Lions can roar very loudly! Their roar can measure up to about 114 decibels in volume, which is louder than any other big cat and can even breach the pain threshold of human hearing. It can be heard as far as 5 miles away (8 km).Lions usually roar this loudly when they are trying to defend their territories or ward off other males. A roar also allows members of a pride to find one another as its sound can travel such long distances.",
            "s live?": "Lions are exclusively found in Africa, scattered across Sub-Saharan Africa. However, there is one species of lion \u2014 the Asiatic lion (Panthera leo leo) \u2014 that only lives in Gujarat, India. There are around 650 wild individuals of this species.Despite dubbed the \u201cking of the jungle\u201d, the lion very rarely enters a closed forest, and they are totally absent from the rainforest. They prefer grassy plains and savannahs, open woodlands with bushes and scrub bordering rivers. The home area of a lion pride range from 13 to 100 square miles.Lions can live high up, too. On Mount Elgon, an extinct shield volcano on the border of Uganda and Kenya, lions have been recorded up to an elevation of 3,600 m (11,800 ft) and close to the snow line on Mount Kenya.Historically, lions spanned most of the central rainforest zone and the Sahara desert. They also lived in southern Europe and Asia.Conservation StatusLions are listed as \u201cVulnerable\u201d on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This is a step above being declared \u201cEndangered\u201d. The lion population is at risk and under threat from habitat loss and hunting.Between 1993 and 2014, the population of lions decreased by 42%. The IUCN\u2019s last assessment places the adult population between 23,000 to 39,000 individuals. The population is even more in jeopardy, because the remaining populations are often geographically isolated from each other, which causes inbreeding.",
            "threats": "Lions do not have any natural predators as they are apex predators and up at the top of the food chain.The biggest threat to lions are humans, particularly hunters. Poachers hunt lions for their bones, which are used in traditional medicines as well as in expensive wines. They are also hunted by trophy hunters and big game hunters. Loss of habitat and lack of food is another common threat to lions.",
            "": "The Barbary lion was thought to go extinct in the 19th century, with the last documented sighting being in Algeria\u2019s Atlas Mountains in 1942. It used to live across the North Coast of Africa and even stretched as far as Egypt and Morocco.",
            "(panthera leo spelaea)": "The Cave lion disappeared around 12,000 years ago. It was found across Eurasia and into Alaska and went extinct with the collapse of the mammoth steppe. It was larger than today\u2019s surviving lions.",

            "faqs": "When are lions most active?Lions are primarily nocturnal (active\u00a0at night) or crepuscular (becoming active at twilight or before sunset). Lions spend much of their time resting, often up to 20 hours per day. Lions rest for lots of different reasons, including energy conservation, lack of prey and to avoid the heat of the day.What is a lions habitat?Lions are mostly found in Africa, with one species, the Asiatic lion, found in India. In these locations they inhabit a wide range of habitats from grassy plains and savannahs to open woodlands with bushes. Despite the lyrics of a popular song, the one place you are almost certain never to see a lion sleeping is in the Jungle.Why do lions have tails?A Lion\u2019s tail comes in handy in a variety of ways, and it is no surprise that they have evolved to maintain their tales because of how much they use them. Physically, a Lion\u2019s tail helps it to balance. But it will also use the tail to signal both in parental situations and hunting.Where do lions sleep?Generally a Lion will sleep wherever it can keep cool. They don\u2019t have many sweat glands and need to conserve energy. Hot environments can make that difficult, so you are likely to find Lions sleeping in thickets and brush, under trees or area with a good through breeze.",

These penguins have several common names. In Australia they are often referred to as Fairy Penguins due to their small size, in New Zealand they are called Little Blue Penguins or just Blue Penguins owing to their plumage color, the New Zealand Maori call them Korora. There are two sub-species recognized: the Little, or Fairy penguin and the White-flippered penguin. ",
            "little penguin characteristics": "Little Penguins are the smallest of all the penguins standing only 16 to 17 inches tall (41 to 44 centimetres) and weighing only about 2 pounds (1 kilogram). Little penguins are also called \u2018Little Blues\u2019 because of the indigo-blue and slate-grey color of their feathers.The White-flippered penguins are distinguished by having a white stripe around the edges of their flippers.",
            "little penguin diet": "Most of their food is caught on shallow dives to depths less than 30 feet but they will sometimes dive to the seabed in search of prey species. Little penguins eat small fish such as anchovies, squid, plankton, krill, small octopus and pilchards.From the sea floor, little penguins may eat crab larvae, sea horses and crustaceans. Like most penguins, they swallow their food whole.",
            "little penguin behaviour": "Little penguins spend their days out at sea hunting for food in the shallow waters close to the shore. They can often be seen congregating in groups, referred to as \u2018rafts\u2019.At dusk, Little penguins return to their burrows or rock crevice colonies, which can be quite noisy especially before their pre-dawn departure back to sea to feed. Since they feed so near to shore they are easy to see from land.",
            "little penguin reproduction": "Female Little penguins arrive in June to the breeding colonies and are met by raucous males who perform complicated courting displays. Peak egg laying time is generally June through August. They lay two eggs at a time which take approximately five weeks to hatch depending on the availability of food supplies.Little penguins may have one, two, or even three broods (clutches) in a season. Nests are usually located in sheltered rock crevices but where these are not available they dig long burrows instead. Most Little penguins mate for life with both males and females incubating the eggs and caring for the young.Throughout their first three weeks the chicks are attended to constantly. Over the next five weeks adults visit them only to feed them regurgitated food. After this period, the young fledglings are then forced from the nest. Little penguin chicks naturally know how to swim and are able to fish and fend for themselves.",
            "little penguin predators": "Little penguins face predators at sea such as sharks, seals (Lion, Leopard, and Fur), Killer whales and predators on land such as Sea Eagles and large Gulls. Man-made hazards include oil spills, plastic, road kills, gill net fishing and loss of breeding habitats.",
            "little penguin conservation": "Whilst not endangered as a whole, Little penguin colonies in areas with significant human activity are under some threat from pollution and feral animals. In Australia they were once common along the southern coast line but the introduction of domestic cats has dramatically reduced their viable habitat. They are now primarily restricted to cat free islands off the coast."

This owl is widespread across Europe, Asia and North Africa, and was first introduced to Britain at the end of the 19th century, and into New Zealand in the early 20th century. The little owl typically inhabits open fields, grasslands and open woodlands, where it has access to insects, earthworms, other invertebrates and small vertebrates that it feeds on. Because the little owl is so widespread and such a common species of bird, its population is not considered to be threatened or endangered.\u00a0 As their name suggests, the little owl is a small owl, usually measuring between 21 and 23 cm.

There are about 2,700 species of lizard on our planet, with only two species being poisonous, the Beaded lizard and the Gila Monster, (pictured left), both from Mexico. However, recent research has revealed that in fact many lizards in the iguanians and monitor (lizard) families have venom-producing glands. None of these pose much danger to humans, as their poison is introduced slowly by chewing, rather than injected as with venomous snakes.",
            "lizard habitats": "Lizards live all over our planet except the polar regions as it is too cold for them to survive. Most live in trees such as the frilled lizard. Some live on the ground. Only a few live in the water like the great marine iguana. Lizards, like most reptiles have to regulate their own body temperature and will bask in the sun to warm up and move to a shade to cool down.",
            "lizard diet": "Lizards typically feed on insects, birds or rodents. A few species are omnivorous or herbivorous. One familiar example of a herbivorous lizard is the iguana, which is unable to properly digest animal protein. Most lizards eat insects (they are insectivores).",
            "lizard reproduction": "Most lizards lay eggs, though a few species are capable of live birth such as the Slow Worm, a legless lizard that resembles a small snake. Slow Worms reproduce from eggs which the female incubates within her body. The incubation period is about 90 to 100 days. In smaller egg laying lizards, female lizards around lay 8 \u2013 12 soft-shelled eggs in a clutch (a set of eggs laid at one time).Some lizards such as the Komodo Dragon digs a hole in the ground and lays 20 \u2013 40 eggs.

By the end of the last ice-age (10,000 \u2013 12,000 years ago) camelids were extinct in North America. As of 2007, there were over 7 million llamas and alpacas in South America and due to importation from South America in the late 20th Century there are now over 100,000 llamas and 6,500 \u2013 7,000 alpacas in the US and Canada. The term Llama is sometimes used more broadly, to indicate any of the four closely related animals that make up the South American branch of the family Camelidae: the true llama, the vicu\u00f1a, alpaca and guanaco. Differentiating characteristics between llamas and alpacas are that llamas are larger and have more elongated heads. Alpacas also have a more luxurious wool than llamas. The most apparent visual difference between llamas and camels is that camels have a hump or humps and llamas do not.",
            "characteristics": "The height of a full-grown, full-size llama is between 5.5 feet (1.6 metres) to 6 feet (1.8 metres) tall at the top of the head. Llamas can weigh approximately between 280 pounds (127 kilograms) and 450 pounds (204 kilograms). At birth, a baby llama (called a cria) can weigh between 20 pounds (9 kilograms) to 30 pounds (14 kilograms).Llama ears are rather long and slightly curved inward, characteristically known as banana shaped. There is no dorsal hump. Feet are narrow, the toes being more separated than in the camels, each having a distinct plantar pad. Their tail is short and their fibre is long, woolly and soft.Below are the general characteristics of a llama:Average Life Span: 15 \u2013 20 years Average Gestation: 331 \u2013 359 days Number of Offspring: Usually single births Weaning: 5 \u2013 6 months Average Weight: 200 \u2013 400 lbs Average Height: 4 feet \u2013 4 feet 5 inches at shoulder height \u2013 5 feet \u2013 5 feet 6 inches at head height. Sound: Just a gentle hum, however, when they are upset or frightened they can make a shrill alarm sound. Temperament: Calm, friendly, slightly shy and very intelligent. Health: Few vet problems; worming \u2013 2 or 3 times a year; vaccination against clostridial diseases and tetanus once a year. Land requirement\u00a0: Maximum 4 \u2013 6 per acres. Shelter: Although very hardy, llamas do need access to a field shelter to protect them from bad weather elements. Fencing: Standard stock fencing. Feeding: Grazing during the summer. In winter, grazing supplemented with hay and a small hard feed daily. Llamas need fresh water available at all times. Shearing: As with sheep, llamas require shearing through summer to prevent heat stroke.Stomach Compartments: 3Toes per foot: 2Name for baby llama: Cria",
            "behaviour": "The Llama is a very intelligent animal and very easy to train. In just one to five repetitions they will learn and remember many skills. Llamas can be trained to do lots of things such as accept a halter, being led on a lead and they can be trained to get in and out of a vehicle, and they can also be trained to pull a cart or carry a pack. Llamas are very sociable animals but they do need the companionship of their own kind.Llamas are a very gentle, shy and a very curious animal. Llamas are calm in nature and have common sense, which make them easy for anyone, even children to handle. Llamas are very enjoyable animals and they are fun to do things with, however, most llamas do not seek affection and they prefer not to be handled excessively.Llamas communicate with each other by ear position, body language, spitting and humming.Llamas usually only spit at other llamas to establish dominance and do not spit at people. The habit of spitting is a defence mechanism. However, usually, a llama would prefer to run away than to confront their assumed aggressor, and is not always a frequent occurrence. That is believed to be due in part to their shy disposition.The sound of the llama making groaning noises or going \u2018mwa\u2019 is often a sign of fear or anger. If a llama is agitated, he will lay his ears back. One may determine how agitated the llama is by the materials in the spit. The more irritated the llama is, the further back into each of the three stomach compartments it will try to draw materials from, for its spit.When correctly reared spitting at a human is a rare thing. Llamas are very social herd animals, however, and do sometimes spit at each other as a way of disciplining lower-ranked llamas in the herd. A llamas social rank in a herd is never static. Llamas can always move up or down in the social ladder by picking small fights. This is usually done between males to see who becomes alpha.Llama fights are visually dramatic with spitting, ramming each other with their chests, neck wrestling and kicking, mainly to knock the other off balance. The female llamas are usually only seen spitting as a means of controlling other herd members.",
            "reproduction": "When female llamas are 12 to 18 months of age they are ready for their first breeding. The male llama reaches his sexual maturity approximately 18 to 24 months of age. Llamas do not have a heat cycle, however, they are induced ovulators. Llamas can be bred any time of the year. Fifty days is the average gestation time.A single baby, called a \u2018cria\u2019 is normally born without assistance. Crias are born in the daylight hours from a standing position and is usually up and nursing in about 90 minutes. The average birth weight of a cria is around 18 to 35 pounds. Rarely do twins occur. The weaning time for the cria is usually 5 months old, depending on the overall health.",
            "sounds": "Llamas being herd animals communicate with a variety of sounds.",
            "humming": " This sounds similar to a person humming and is the main method of communcation. Llamas hum, unlike humans, when they are tired, distraught, curious or worried. Mothers may also hum to greet their new baby. The humming sound is used for many different reasons. Hold your mouse on the picture to listen to a Llama humming sound.",
            "clucking": "This sounds like a person clicking their tongue from the roof of their mouth to the bottom of their mouth. Llamas often hold back their ears when they do this and seem to do this when greeting new llamas or flirting with the female llamas.",
            "orgling": "This sounds like a person gargling. This sound is made by the male when approaching a female for breeding and will continue until the copulation is complete, which can be anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour.",
            "alarm call": "This call is made when the llama is feeling threatened or startled by something . It is a loud, high pitched rhythmic sound. Being herd animals, this call is used to alert the others in the herd when one spies a predator.In the wild, llamas travel in herds. When one of them spy a predator they make an alarm call to warn others. If your llamas are making an alarm call, go and investigate. Maybe what they are seeing may not be a threat, however, they are seeing something."

            "desc": "The long eared owl (Asio otus), also known as the northern long-eared owl, the lesser horned owl or cat owl, is a medium-sized species of owl that breeds in many areas through Europe and the Palearctic, as well as in North America. It belongs to the family Strigidae, known as the typical owls, which contains most extant species of owl. This species of owl is superbly camouflaged but can often be identified by their long, low hoots. They are nocturnal hunters that roost in dense foliage and hunt over open ground. Their diet mainly consists of small rodents, especially voles, but they can adapt their prey depending on availability. Long-eared owls are not strongly territorial or sedentary and are partially migratory, although can appear nomadic, too. The long-eared owl is one of the most widely distributed and populated owl species in the world, and due to its broad range and numbers it is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN.",
            "lifespan": "The long-eared owl is thought to have a relatively short lifespan, with most living to around 4 years of age. However, they can live longer, with the oldest known wild long-eared owl living 27 years and 9 months.",
            "diet": "Long eared owls have a wide diet, eating small mammals, birds, invertebrates, reptiles, amphibians and fish. Their most common prey is small mammals, like rodents, which they get most of their energy from. They are known to primarily hunt voles, and even help to control vole populations in some countries.Where voles are not available, the long-eared owl mostly feeds on field mice, house mice, and rats. Other mammals eaten include bats, hedgehogs, moles, rabbits, hares, squirrels and weasels.While long-eared owls do not feed on birds very often, they have been known to take house sparrows, Eurasian tree sparrows, starlings and blackbirds. Snakes, lizards, frogs, toads, carp and arachnids are further prey occasionally taken by this species.",
            "hunting habits": "The long-eared owl hunts mostly on the edge of woodlands, hedgerows and open spaces with rough grassland. They hunt while flying low to the ground, and use their very good sense of hearing to detect the rustling of their prey instead of using their eyes. They are silent fliers, with their feathers muting the sound of the owl\u2019s passage through the air. Once they have spotted prey, they quickly drop with their talons spread to pounce on the prey.Instead of piercing their prey with their talons, owls usually constrict their prey to death with their feet. They are also known to kill the prey by biting the back of the skull and then swallow it whole.Because these owls swallow their prey whole, they then regurgitate the indigestible parts back up in pellets, which can often be found on the ground around owl nests. Some biologists collect these pellets and use them to learn about owl diets.",
            "competitors": "Because the long eared owl overlaps other owls in its range, it often has to share its prey with other species. Tawny owls are one, although tawny owls tend to show greater dietary flexibility. Short-eared and barn owls also compete or resources with long eared owls. Not only do they compete for food, but they also compete for habitats",
            "long-eared owl behavior": "The long-eared owl is nocturnal, with activity beginning around dusk. During daytime, long-eared owls tends to roost in an upright position on a branch. In the non-breeding season, long-eared owls are often prone to occur in aggregations of owls while roosting, which is quite uncommon for owl species. This can include anywhere from 6 to 50 owls. These birds roost close to the trunk, within dense foliage to remain unseen.",
            "migration": "Some long-eared owls are migratory. Northern populations are migratory, showing a strong tendency to move south in the fall. Central European adults are less migratory. Despite some populations of this species being consistent annual migrants, some populations are considered nomadic as they have a very sporadic migratory pattern.",
            "communication": "The long-eared owl is mostly silent, although uses a wide repertoire of calls to communicate during the breeding season. The most common vocalizations are soft musical hoots and single quavering hoots. They may also shriek or whistle when excited. Parents will strongly defend their young and alarm calls are demonstrated by both sexes.",
            "reproduction": "Long eared owls are monogamous, with breeding pairs beginning to form in the winter. Males advertise to females that they are looking for a mate by using songs and aerial displays. Breeding takes place from February to mid-July.The long-eared owl nests in trees, usually in a nest built by another animal. Occasionally, they will build a nest of their own. Once the nest has been selected, the female lays 2 to 10 (usually 5 to 6) eggs at 2 day intervals. The eggs are white, smooth and glossy.The female incubates the eggs for 25 to 30 days, never leaving the eggs uncovered in the day although she takes breaks during the night. When born, the chicks are semi-altricial, although leave the nest after 21 days.Males provide food for the female and young during the incubation and brooding period. The young begin to fly at around 35 days and become independent at 10 to 11 weeks old. They become sexually mature at around 1 year old.",
            "long-eared owl location and habitat": "The long-eared owl is found throughout the northern hemisphere, with their range extending from North America, through Europe and as far east as Japan. There have also been small populations found in North and East Africa, the Azores, and the Canary Islands.This species prefers dense vegetation close to grasslands and are common in tree belts or small woods along streams of plains and even desert oases. They seek out forest edges that have access to open spaces and are abundant prey, with wooded cover for roosting and nesting. They can also be found in small tree groves, thickets surrounded by wetlands, grasslands, marshes and farmlands. Their range can extend from sea level up to 2000 m.Long Eared Owl Conservation StatusThe long eared owl population is thought to be stable across most of its range, and for this reason it is listed as Least Concern by the IUCN Red List. The IUCN estimates the total population between 2 million and 5.5 million, placing it as one of the most numerous owls.The biggest threats to the long-eared owl are humans. Hunters have historically shot these owls, and they are also killed in road traffic accidents and poisoned by pesticides and heavy metals.Habitat loss is another threat to the long-eared owl. This can be due to land development and climate change.",
            "long-eared owl predators": "Adult long eared owls are preyed on by many other raptors, including great-horned owls, barred owls, greater spotted eagles, golden eagles, red-tailed hawks, red-shouldered hawks, northern goshawks, eagle owls, common buzzards, and peregrine falcons.Long eared owl nestlings are preyed on by porcupines, bull snakes, American crows, black-billed magpies, and several hawk species. Adults defend nests by circling the nest and snapping their bill at the predator, or dive-bombing the predator while making alarm calls. They may also pretend to be injured to draw attention away from the nest.Because long-eared owls are so well camouflaged, they are often not seen by predators when nesting in trees.",
            "importance": "Long eared owls are important to their ecosystem. They help to control the populations of their prey in the area, so these areas do not become too overpopulated. They can also help humans in the same way, because they eat rodents such as voles and mice.Long Eared Owl vs. Short Eared OwlIn much of the long-eared owls range, it occurs with the short-eared owl. The two belong to the same genus and, aside from their names, they differ quite a bit. For starters, the short-eared owl is larger than the long-eared owl and, of course, the ear-tufts of the long-eared owl are much longer than those of the short-eared owl. The short-eared owls also have yellow irises instead of orange, with horizontal black surrounding the eyes instead of vertical on the long-eared. Short-eared owls are paler and have less distinctive markings, too.In terms of habitat, the short-eared owl favors treeless, open habitats, while the long-eared prefers dense vegetation and forest edges. Long Eared Owl vs. Other Owl SpeciesThe long-eared owl can look very similar to other owl species, especially to the untrained eye. Below are some other owl species that are often confused with the long-eared owl in the wild, and their differences from the long-eared.Stygian Owl (Asio stygius)The stygian owl is larger than the long-eared and is generally darker with inkier and bolder patterned plumage. The facial disc appears off-black. They also have partially bare toes.Tawny OwlTawny owls co-exist with the long-eared owl in Eurasia, but they have a much rounder and bulkier build. Their head is also rounder and more broad, and they have no ear tufts. Their eyes are blackish-brown and they have short wings.Eurasian Eagle-Owl (Bubo bubo)The Eurasian eagle-owl is much larger than the long-eared owl, with a large, square looking head and ear tufts set closer to the edge. Its feet and talons are also larger and much more powerful.These eagle owls have more heavily patterned crowns and backs with heavy blackish markings, but also have a less strongly marked facial disc than the long-eared.Asian Fish OwlAsian fish owls are also much longer than the long-eared owl. They have less variable coloring and tousled looking ear tufts.Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus)The great horned owl has a squarish head and more widely separated ear tufts. They are also larger and heavier.Marsh Owl (Asio capensis)The marsh owl is usually brown in color and has fine mottling. It also has brown ears and very small ear tufts.Screech OwlScreech owls are much smaller than long-eared owls and have very short ear tufts.Long Eared Owl FAQsWhere do long eared owls live in the world?The long-eared owl is found throughout the northern hemisphere. They can be found in North America, Europe and parts of Asia. There are small populations of the long-eared owl in Africa, too.Are long eared owls migratory?Some long-eared owls are migratory. Some move south in the winter, while other populations stay put. Some populations also sporadically migrate, which gives them the appearance of being nomadic.What do long eared owls eat?For the most part, long-eared owls eat voles and other rodents, such as mice. They have also been known to eat other birds, invertebrates and reptiles.Do long eared owls really have long ears?Long-eared owls do not actually have long ears. The name \u201clong-eared owl\u201d comes from their head feathers which appear by their ears as tufts at the top of their head.Is the long-eared owl rare?The long eared owl is not a rare owl. In fact, they are one of the most numerous owls on the planet, with a population estimate of between 2 million and 5.5 million."

Their long antennae can often be as long as or longer than the beetles own body. In various members of the family, however, the antennae are quite short and such species can only be recognized with difficulty from related beetle families such as Chrysomelidae. This family of beetles is a large one, with over 20,000 species described. Several are serious pests, with the larvae boring into wood, where they can cause extensive damage to either living trees or to wood in buildings. One particular species, the old house borer \u2018Hylotrupes bajulus\u2019 is a particular problem indoors. A number of species mimic ants, bees and wasps, though a majority of species are cryptically colored.

            "desc": "Lynx is the name given to four wild cats from the felidae family. The four species of lynx are: the Canadian Lynx (Lynx canadensis), Eurasian (or Siberian) Lynx (Lynx lynx), Bobcat (Lynx rufus) also known as the wildcat and the Spanish (or Iberian) Lynx (Lynx pardinus). The Caracal, despite sometimes being called Persian Lynx or African Lynx, does not belong to this genus. The Spanish lynx population continues to decline and it is one of the most endangered cats in the world. The Canadian lynx is becoming very rare in the northern United States due to hunting, habitat destruction and competition with the more aggressive bobcat. The bobcat is the most successful out of all wildcats as it is highly adaptable both in habitat and prey. The Iberian lynx is one of the worlds rarest mammals and is rated as the most endangered cat species in the world because of its low population, limited number of habitats and its small range.",
            "description": "Lynx are medium sized cats whose coats of fur vary in color according to their climate range. Lynx in the southern regions of their range tend to be shorter haired, darker in color and have smaller paws, whereas in the Northern regions their coats are thicker and lighter in color (for camouflage), and their paws are larger and much more padded to deal with the cold and snow.All species of lynx have white fur on their chests, bellies and on the insides of their legs. Lynx have short tails, long whiskers and characteristic tufts of black hair on the tip of the ears. Lynx have long front and hind legs that support their thick set body which measures 65 \u2013 130 centimetres (26 \u2013 51 inches) in length and weighs about 11 \u2013 37 pounds (5 \u2013 17 kilograms). Lynx have a tail length of 2 \u2013 6 inches (5 \u2013 16 centimetres).Canadian lynx are smaller than Eurasian lynx and are more grey in coloration. Like all cats, the lynx has exceptional night vision due to a layer of mirror-like cells in their eyes called the tapetum lucidum. Light that is unabsorbed by the retinal receptor layer hits the tapetum lucidum and is reflected right back at the retinal receptor layer for another chance at absorption. This is why cat eyes shine in the dark. Their sensitive whiskers, quick reflexes and acute hearing also help the lynx hunt at night.",
            "habitat": "Lynx cats prefer cold, wilderness areas and high altitude forests with dense coverings of grass, reeds and shrubs. Lynx cats have very large ranges, by far the largest range of any other felids. Lynx make dens in rock crevices or under ledges. In harsh, severe weather and when breeding, lynx take shelter in caves or in hollow trees or logs. Although the Iberian lynx appears not to fear man, it will not live in areas where permanent settlements of humans are established.",
            "diet": "Lynx cats are carnivores, diurnal hunters and feed up on a wide range of animals including reindeer, roe deer, small red deer, caribou, chamois, birds, small mammals, such as snowshoe hares, fish, sheep and goats. Although the lynx hunts mainly on the ground, it can climb trees and it can also swim, catching fish to assist its diet. Although not a timid hunter the lynx will rarely contest its prey if confronted by other carnivores and will leave the prey uneaten. The Eurasian lynx lives in the forest and eats ungulates such as deer, while the Iberian lynx prefers scrub vegetation and eats mainly rabbits. Lynx hunt by stalking or ambushing their prey.",
            "behaviour": "Lynx cats are usually solitary creatures, however, small groups of lynx sometimes hunt and travel together. Male territories are larger and can overlap several female territories. Lynx cats are agile climbers and spend most of their time on the branches of trees, waiting for prey such as weaker mammals and terrestrial birds to pass beneath them. Lynx are very vocal animals and they can make an amazing variety of hissing, chattering and yowling sounds.",
            "reproduction": "The lynx breeding season occurs in late winter. Female lynx give birth to 2 \u2013 4 kittens after a gestation period of 56 \u2013 70 days, once a year. The kittens weigh 200 \u2013 300 grams at birth. The female will nurse the kittens for 5 months, although some kittens can eat meat at one month old.Male lynx do not take part in the parental care of the kittens. The kittens and their mother will stay together until the following winters mating season and siblings may remain together for a while after they have separated from their mother. The life span of the lynx is as long as 12 \u2013 20 years.",
            "conservation status": "The hunting of lynx cats is illegal in many countries. The Spanish (Iberian) Lynx is critically endangered, facing extinction and the killing of any individuals has been outlawed since the 1970s in Spain and Portugal. In 2000, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service designated the Canadian Lynx a Threatened species. Lynx are hunted for their fur and by farmers to protect their farm animals, as they are considered to be a predator of domestic animals."

It is also called the Cynomolgus Monkey and the Long-tailed Macaque. The Crab-eating Macaque is found in a wide variety of habitats, including primary lowland rainforests, disturbed and secondary rainforests and riverside and coastal forests of nipa palm and mangrove.The Crab-eating Macaque Monkey also easily adjusts to human settlements and are considered sacred at some Hindu temples and on some small islands.The native range of the Crab-eating Macaque includes most of mainland Southeast Asia, including the Malay Archipelago islands of Sumatra, Java and Borneo, the islands of the Philippines and the Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. Although this monkey is often referred to as the Crab-eating Macaque, its diet is by no means limited to crabs. Other food items are in fact far more common. They are an opportunistic feeding omnivore, meaning they can and will eat a wide variety of animals, plants and other materials, it also eats leaves, flowers, roots and bark. It also preys on bird chicks and nesting female birds, lizards, frogs, fishes and bird eggs.The Crab-eating Macaque is a very social animal that lives in groups anywhere from 5 \u2013 60 individuals. These groups are multi-male groups, normally containing 2 \u2013 5 males and 2 \u2013 3 times as many females. Their groups are female orientated. They will remain in a a group up to 4 or 5 years and will emigrate several times throughout their life. Crab-eating Macaques have a strict dominance hierarchy. Adult males rank higher than females.Female Crab-eating Macaques have a gestation period of 167 \u2013 193 days, the female gives birth to one young. The infants weight at birth is approximately 350 grams. Infants are born with black fur and this fur will begin to turn to a yellow-green, grey-green, or reddish-brown shade after about 3 months. Young juveniles stay with the mother and relatives playing together forming bonds that may help them when they emigrate from their natal group. Males that emigrate with a partner seem to be more successful than those that move off alone.Depending on sub-species, the body length of the adult monkey is 38 \u2013 55 centimetres with comparably short arms and legs. The tail is longer than the body, typically 40 \u2013 65 centimetres. Males are considerably larger than females, weighing 5 \u2013 9 kilograms compared to the 3 \u2013 6 kilograms of female individuals.",

The Celebes Crested Macaque lives in the northeast of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi (Celebes) as well as on smaller neighbouring islands.The Celebes Crested Macaques skin and hairless face is, with the exception of some white hair in the shoulder range, entirely black. The Celebes Crested Macaque Monkey has a long muzzle with high cheeks and the long hair tuft, or crest, at the top side of the head. Their tail is only 2 centimetres of stub. With a total body length of 45 to 60 centimetres and a weight of 7 to 10 kilograms, it is one of the smaller macaque species. The Celebes Crested Macaque is a diurnal rainforest dweller.The Celebes Crested Macaque is primarily terrestrial, spending more than 60% of its day on the ground foraging for food and socializing, while sleeping and searching for food in the trees. It lives in groups of 5 to 25 individuals. Smaller groups have only a single male, while larger groups have up to 4 males. The females, however, always outnumber the males by about 4 to 1. Since young males must leave their birth group upon maturity, they sometimes form bachelor groups before they look for an existing mixed group. Communication consists of various sounds and gestures.The Celebes Crested Macaque is an omnivore, 70% of its diet consists of fruits, however, it also consumes leaves, buds, seeds, fungus, birds and bird eggs, insects (such as caterpillars) and the occasional small lizard or frog.Female gestation period is 174 days and the birth of a single young happens in the spring when food is more plentiful. Infant monkeys are nursed approximately for one year and become fully mature in 3 to 4 years, females somewhat sooner than males.The Celebes Crested Macaques life span is approximately 20 years. The total population of the macaque on Sulawesi is estimated at 4,000 \u2013 6,000, while a booming population of up to 100,000 monkeys are found on Bacan, an island in Indonesia.",

The Lion-tailed Macaque Monkey has a head-to-tail length of 45 to 60 centimetres and a weight of 3 to 10 kilograms and is one of the smaller macaques. Their tail is medium length and measures around 25 centimetres and has a black tuft at the end, similar to a lions tail.The Lion-tailed Macaque is a diurnal rainforest dweller. They are good climbers and spend most of their life in the trees. Unlike other macaques, it avoids humans. In group behaviour, it is much like other macaques as it lives in hierarchical groups of usually 10 to 20 individuals, which consist of some males and many females. It is a territorial animal, defending its area first with loud cries towards the invading troops.The Lion-tailed Macaque primarily eats fruits, however, it also eats leaves, buds, insects and small vertebrates.Female gestation is approximately 6 months. The young are nursed for one year. Sexual maturity is reached at 4 years for females, 6 years for males. The Lion-tailed Macaques life span in the wild is approximately 20 years, while in captivity up to 30 years.The Lion-tailed Macaque ranks among the rarest and most threatened primates. According to estimations of the IUCN, only approximately 2,500 of these monkeys live scattered over several areas in southwest India. The destruction of their habitat and the fact that they avoid human proximity, has led to the drastic decrease of their population. Many zoos take part in breeding programs which help to secure the survival of this species.",

Females are smaller, averaging 47 centimetres in length and 5.3 kilograms in weight. Rhesus Macaque Monkeys are brown or grey in color and have pink faces which are typically bereft of fur. Rhesus Macaques tails are of medium length and average between 20 and 22 centimetres.Rhesus Macaques have a life span of about 25 years. Inhabiting arid, open areas, the Rhesus Macaque may be found in grasslands, woodlands and in mountainous regions up to 2,500 metres in elevation. Rhesus Macaques are good swimmers and they enjoy this activity. The Rhesus Macaque is noted for its tendency to move from rural to urban areas, coming to rely on handouts or refuse from humans.A diurnal animal, the Rhesus Macaque is both arboreal and terrestrial. The Rhesus Macaque is an omnivore and feeds on leaves and pine needles, roots and the occasional insect or small animal. They have specialized pouch-like cheeks, allowing them to temporarily store their food. The gathered morsels are eaten sometime later, in safe surroundings. Troops may contain up to 180 individuals, however 20 is normally the average. Females may outnumber the males by a ratio of 4 to 1.The social hierarchy is also matriarchal, rank dependent on lineage to the lead female. Care of young and territory defence duties are shared amongst the troop. Monkeys that discover food will normally advertise the fact by specific calls.The females cycle is similar to humans with menstrual cycles of around 28 days. Mating is not confined to a specific season. Gestation may last from 135 \u2013 194 days. Females are mature by the age of 3 years and males at 4 years. The life span of a rhesus monkey in captivity is approximately 15 \u2013 20 years for males and 20 \u2013 25 years for females. These monkeys rarely live beyond 15 years of age in the wild.",

It is one of eight species of crested penguin that is found on the Antarctic Peninsula, on a number of Antarctic and subantarctic islands in the Atlantic and Indian oceans, and on the islands near the coasts of Chile and Argentina. Macaroni penguins are most notable for their long yellow-orange feathers on their crest that contrast with the black feathers on their head. \u00a0 Macaroni penguins are often confused with royal penguins, and are often thought of as the same species. However, they are in fact different species. Macaroni penguins are a member of the genus Eudyptes and the order Sphenisciformes. Their scientific name is Eudyptes chrysolophus.",
            "lifespan": "The life span of the macaroni penguin ranges from 8 to 15 years.",
            "diet": "The macaroni penguin\u2019s diet is mostly comprised of krill, but they also eat other crustaceans, cephalopods and small fish. They catch most of their prey at depths of 15\u201370 metres (50\u2013230 feet), but will dive as deep as 115 metres (375 feet) if needed! They usually dive deeper and for longer outside of the breeding season. These penguins can venture as far as 303 kilometres (188 miles) from their colonies in search of food.Dives are usually two minutes in duration and rarely exceed this. The penguin\u2019s dives are V-shaped, and no time is spent at the sea bottom. They will usually catch between 4 to 16 krill or 40 to 50 amphipods per dive.Like several other penguin species, the macaroni penguin sometimes deliberately swallows small (10 to 30 mm in diameter) stones. This is thought to aid in deep-sea diving, helping to weigh them down to get to deeper levels. These stones may also help to grind food, especially the exoskeletons of crustaceans, which are a significant part of their diet.Macaroni penguins forage for food on an almost daily basis, particularly when they have chicks to feed. During breeding, the female does most of the foraging until the end of the guard stage. Foraging usually happens in the daylight hours and is restricted in the winter due to the shorter days. Some overnight diving happens, but these dives are shallower than usual (3 to 6 m (9.8 to 19.7 ft)) and normally only happens outside of the breeding season or if the chicks are older.",
            "behavior": "Apart from coming ashore for breeding and moulting, the macaroni penguin spends its life at sea. They are very social animals when it comes to both foraging and nesting, and their breeding colonies are some of the largest and most densely populated. These birds are very vocal, which is evident when the male macaroni penguins are at sea during the breeding period and the colonies quieten dramatically.Macaroni penguins will fight with other individuals from adjacent nests, often engaging in \u2018bill-jousting\u2019. This is when the birds lock their bills and wrestle, as well as batting their flippers and pecking at each other\u2019s napes. These animals are also prone to displays to confront or drive off unwelcome individuals.The macaroni penguin also has a submissive display, which includes the \u2018slender walk\u2019. This is where the penguins move through the colony with their feathers flattened, their flippers moved to the front of their body, and their head and neck hunched.",
            "reproduction": "The adult macaroni penguin is a social nester, and they congregate in very large breeding colonies. They begin to breed from late October, and typically lay their eggs in early November. Their nests are made of small stones and pebbles in muddy or gravelly areas, although some are made of grasses, too. These nests are densely packed, and will usually be located around 66 cm apart in the middle of a colony to 86 cm at the edges.A female macaroni penguin will lay two eggs each breeding season. The first egg to be laid is very unlikely to survive and usually measures only 61 to 64% of the size of the second egg. The first egg is between 90 and 94g (3.2\u20133.3 oz), whereas the second is between 145 and 150g (5.1\u20135.5 oz). Together, they weigh 4.8% of the mother\u2019s body weight and the composition is 20% yolk, 66% albumen, and 14% shell. The shell is very thick, preventing breakage, and the yolk is is large. Some of the yolk remains at hatching and is consumed by the chick in its first few days.Many penguin pairs discard the smaller egg by pushing it out of the nest. On rare occasions, the smaller egg is incubated until it hatches, and the breeding pair raises both chicks.Both parents incubate the egg in two or three long shifts over the course of the full 33 to 39 day period. For the first three to four weeks, the egg is incubated by both parents. For the next, the mother incubates the egg while the father goes to sea, and, for the last, its father incubates the egg. Once the third shift of incubation begins, the mother will not return to the nest until the egg has been hatched.Both sexes of macaroni penguins fast for a considerable amount of time during breeding and they lose 36 to 40% of their body weight during this period.Once the chick has been hatched, the father does most of the caring while the mother forages for food and brings it back to the nest. The chicks have only a few feathers in their first month of life, so their father helps to keep them warm. Macaroni penguin chicks have gray feathers on their back and a white underside.After the first three to four weeks, both parents may go out to sea to forage for food. During this time, the baby penguins form nursery groups with other chicks called \u2018cr\u00e8ches\u2019 where they huddle together for warmth and protection. They are ready to go out on their own when their adult feathers have grown in, which is usually around 60 to 70 days old. The penguins usually leave their breeding colony in around April or May to return to the ocean.Like many species of penguins, macaroni penguins are mostly monogamous and are likely to mate for life. Female macaroni penguins become sexually mature at age five, while most males wait until the age of six to breed. Females breed at a younger age because the male population is larger and this allows female penguins to select more experienced male partners as soon as the females are physically able to breed. Once females arrive at a colony, males use sexual displays to attract partners, which includes bowing, braying and trumpeting.Location and HabitatMacaroni penguins breed in at least 216 colonies at 50 sites. They are found in much of Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula, including the northern South Shetland Islands, Bouvet Island, the Prince Edward and Marion islands, the Crozet Islands, the Kerguelen Islands, and the Heard and McDonald Islands. They are also found in South America; in southern Chile, the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and South Orkney Islands.While macaroni penguins are foraging, they\u2019ll range as far as islands off Australia, New Zealand, southern Brazil, Tristan da Cunha, and South Africa. They spend most of their life at sea, and only come ashore to breed and moult.\u00a0Conservation StatusA 1993 review estimated that the macaroni was the most abundant species of penguin, with a minimum of 11,841,600 pairs worldwide. It has been recorded that there are at least 216 breeding colonies at 50 sites. Despite this, there has been a significant decline of these penguins in several locations, such as South Georgia and Isla Recalada in southern Chile, especially over the last 30 years, and this has resulted as the macaroni penguin being listed as globally Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.The cause of the decline in numbers is unclear, but it is thought that climate change, commercial fishing of krill and other penguin prey, and an abundance in prey species are to contribute. There are conservation efforts in place, with long term monitoring programs underway at a number of breeding colonies and reserve protection in areas of penguin breeding.",
            "predators": "Birds and aquatic mammals are the macaroni penguin\u2019s biggest predators. These include the leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx), Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella), Subantarctic fur seal (A. tropicalis), and killer whale (Orcinus orca), all of which prey on the macaroni penguin in the water.The penguins are most at risk when in the water, with low risk of predation when at breeding sites. Predators usually only take eggs or chicks if they have been abandoned or left unattended. These predators are usually Skua species, the snowy sheathbill, and kelp gull.\u00a0"

            "characteristics": "Like its three other closely related relatives in the Spheniscus genus, the Magellanic penguin has black-to-brown shading on its back and white coloring on its breast and trunk. The Magellanic penguins chests have scattered black spots.The Magellanic penguin can be distinguished from Humboldt and African penguins by the two bands crossing its front. One band is a wide black strip under the chin and another is in the shape of an upside down horseshoe on the stomach. In Humboldt penguins, this band is somewhat incomplete and in African penguins it is absent. Magellanic Penguins have very dense feathers: more than 70 per square inch. Their feathers have oil on them, for waterproofing.Their \u2018tuxedo\u2019 attire not only gives them a somewhat comical air, but it also helps hide them from predators. Their white belly blends in with the bright sun on land, while their black back blends in with the dark ocean waves. Magellanic Penguins stand about 27 inches (70 centimetres) tall and weigh about 9 pounds (4 kilograms). During the warmer weather of the breeding season Magellanic penguins lose the feathers around their eyes. When it starts to get cold again the feathers grow back.",
            "diet": "Magellanic penguins feed in the water, preying on cuttlefish, sardines, squid, krill and other crustaceans caught on relatively shallow pursuit dives. Magellanic Penguins drink sea water, filtering out the salt with their salt excreting glands.",
            "behaviour": "Magellanic penguins are excellent long distance swimmers and often hunt in groups to aid in catching prey. Using their wings like paddles, they can achieve speeds of over 15 miles per hour.",
            "reproduction": "Breeding season for the Magellanic penguins is from late September to early February when adults come to shore to establish nesting sites within loose colonies. Naturally shy and seclusive on land, mated pairs nest in deep burrows (often hiding there when disturbed) where the female lays two eggs. Both the male and female share in the responsibility of caring for the chicks, often taking shifts lasting ten to fifteen days while the other hunts for food. The eggs take five to six weeks to hatch and the chicks will stay in the burrow for another month when they will molt into their adult feathers. At 60 to 70 days old the chicks are ready to head out to sea.",
            "predators": "Magellanic penguins are occasionally preyed upon by the Southern sea lion. Unguarded or abandoned chicks and eggs fall prey to the Kelp gull and the Giant petrel.",
            "conservation": "Millions of Magellanic Penguins still live on the coasts of Chile and Argentina, however, the main threats to these species are the vulnerability of large breeding colonies to oil spills and the decline of fish populations, as well as predators including sea lions feeding on adults and giant petrels preying on penguin chicks."

            "image": "https://animalcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/magpie-1580407-1133584-340x200.jpg",
            "desc": "Magpies belong to the family Corvidae, which also contains the crows, ravens, rooks, jackdaws, jays, treepies, choughs, and nutcrackers. There are four genera of magpies, although magpies in the genus Pica are most well known. These birds are known for being mainly black and white in color and reside in temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and western North America. Magpies in the other three genera are generally blue and green in color and are usually found in South to East Asia. Magpies are known to be very intelligent creatures. They were once popular as cagebirds and are known for their songs. Originally, they were known as simply \u201cpies\u201d. This is thought to derive from a Proto-Indo-European root meaning \u201cpointed\u201d, in reference to either their beak or perhaps their tail. The prefix \u201cmag\u201d dates from the 16th century and comes from the short form of the given name Margaret, which was once used to mean women in general. This was used as their call was considered to sound like the chattering of a woman, and so it came to be called the \u201cmagpie\u201d.",
            "lifespan": "Generally magpies live to around 25 years of age, although they have also been known to live up to 30 years old.",
            "diet": "Magpies are not picky about the food they eat. They are known to eat beetles, flies, caterpillars, spiders, worms and leatherjackets, and will also eat plant material such as wild fruits, berries and grains. They will also sometimes steal eggs and even chicks from the nests of other birds.In the summer they tend to eat more animal based foods, while in the fall and winter, they will eat more plant matter. This, of course, depends largely on where the magpie resides.Magpies use their excellent hearing abilities to obtain food, but will also use their sight and smell. When they are on the ground, they can hear the faintest of sounds \u2013 even other animals chewing underground. They then use their beaks to pierce the ground and drag out their prey.",
            "behavior": "Magpies gather in flocks. Flocks are usually made up of a mating pair of magpies and their babies, so there are roughly eight members in a flock. However, in colder parts of the world, flocks can contain a large number of magpies. This helps them to keep warm, and also protects them from predators.Magpies are often noted for their interesting gait. They take long, slow steps and seem to be strutting instead of just walking. They have also been witnessed landing on deer, elk, and other animals to eat ticks from their fur.These birds can be very aggressive and some species will attack anything they think is invading their territory. However, some species are also very social and can form bonds with humans.Magpies are known for their for calls and songs. These can vary based on the species.",
            "intelligence": "Magpies are known for being very intelligent animals. One species in particular, the Eurasian magpie, is one of the most intelligent birds in the world, and in fact one of the most intelligent animals on the planet.They have shown the ability to make and use tools, imitate human speech, grieve, play games, and work in teams. Other examples of their intelligence include when one of their own kind dies, a grouping will form around the body for a \u201cfuneral\u201d, and to portion food to their young, magpies will use self-made utensils to cut meals into proper sizes.These magpies have also passed the \u201cmirror test,\u201d which proves an organism\u2019s ability to recognize itself in a reflection. Aside from humans, the only other species to have passed the mirror test include common chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, dolphins and elephants.",
            "reproduction": "Magpies breeding season can vary based on the species. These birds usually meet and then mate for life. However, if a male is killed while the young are in the nest, the female will take a new partner.Magpies build nests that are made from sticks and twigs which are held together with mud. Magpies nests are dome-shaped and often contain an additional mud-lined cup inside them. They generally prefer to nest in trees and thorny bushes where they can keep themselves and their young hidden and safe from predators.Females will typically lay between three and five eggs which are greenish-blue in color and will sit on them for roughly three weeks until they hatch. During this time the male feeds her on the nest. Incubation starts in the middle of the laying period, so the earliest eggs hatch first.These birds are born blind and without feathers. Once the young are hatched, they are fed worms and insects by their parents. The male magpie defends the nest while the female is responsible for feeding the babies. Baby magpies stay for 24 to 30 days in the nest before moving out. Their parents still feed them for a further four weeks after leaving the nest. Baby magpies don\u2019t go far though, they stay within their parent\u2019s territory.Magpies usually breed from two years old although some may breed at one year.Magpie Location and HabitatMagpies can be found throughout the world. Those in the genus Pica are found in Europe, Asia, and western North America, while magpies in the genera Urocissa and Cissa are found in South to East Asia.Their habitat preference generally changes based on the region that they live in. They have been found in forests, meadows, savannas, sagebrush, woodlands and meadows, usually near rivers and streams so they don\u2019t have to stray too far when feeding their young. They are generally found in temperate regions.Magpie Conservation StatusMagpie species are, for the most part, not endangered and listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. In some countries, their population is large and they are very widespread. However, some species of magpie, such as the Asir magpie, the yellow-billed magpie and the Sri Lankan blue magpie, are considered to be vulnerable or endangered.The biggest threat to magpies is not actually predators, but loss of habitat due to climate change or human development.",
            "predators": "Magpies are preyed on by a range of other animals. They are mostly taken by coyotes, foxes, dogs, monitor lizards, and cats. They can also be eaten by other, larger birds, such as eagles, hawks, ospreys, and owls.Magpies are known to be quite aggressive animals, and will defend their family and young. This is especially important for injured and young magpies because they are often more of a target to the predators.",
            "cultural importance": "In many cultures, the magpie is an important symbol. In East Asian culture, the magpie is a very popular bird and is a symbol of good luck and fortune.In European culture, the magpie is has a reputation for collecting shiny objects such as wedding rings and other valuables. Specifically in England, there is a superstition that the sight of a single magpie is said to bring sorrow or bad luck, the sight of two magpies is said to bring joy or good luck, and spotting more than two magpies is said to determine the sex of a future child.Magpie FAQsWhat is the difference between a crow and a magpie?Crows and magpies both belong to the family Corvidae, and, although they are very similar and are both very intelligent, there are some differences between the two animals. Crows are bigger than magpies and are black all over, without any markings. Magpies have a very long tail and can be black and white in color or green and blue. Another distinguishing characteristic is that crows migrate whereas magpies do not.Are magpies always black and white in color?No. Some species of magpies, predominantly in the genus Pica are black and white in color. Depending on what part of the world you live in, these may be the only species of magpie you are seen.However, other magpies, especially those in the genera Urocissa, Cissa, and Cyanopica are actually not black and white \u2014 but can be quite bright green or blue in color. They can also have red markings, red beaks and red legs and feet.How many species of magpie are there?There are at least eighteen species of magpie, split into four genera. We have included some more detail about each species below.Are magpies dangerous birds?Magpies are not dangerous to humans, but they are territorial. If you enter their territory at the wrong time, they may exhibit swooping, in which they may try to scare you away. With other animals, a flock of magpies will chase an intruder away, especially if its means protecting their young.How intelligent are magpies?Magpies are very intelligent animals. In fact, the Eurasian magpie is one of the most intelligent animals on the planet. Their brain-to-body-mass ratio is outmatched only by that of humans and equals that of aquatic mammals and great apes. They exhibit very intelligent behavior, such as imitating human speech and using tools. They are also one of only a few animals that have passed the \u201cmirror test\u201d.Magpie TaxonomyWithin the Corvidae family, there are four genera of magpie: Pica, Urocissa, Cissa, and Cyanopica. Magpies in the genus Pica are a Holarctic species with black and white coloration, and is probably closely related to crows and Eurasian jays. Magpies in the genera Urocissa and Cissa are found from South to East Asia with vivid coloration, which is predominantly green or blue.There are only two species in the genus Cyanopica. The azure-winged magpie and the Iberian magpie were formerly thought to constitute a single species, but have actually been shown to be two distinct species.Genus PicaEurasian magpie (Pica pica)Black-billed magpie (Pica hudsonia)Yellow-billed magpie (Pica nuttalli)Asir magpie (Pica asirensis)Maghreb magpie (Pica mauritanica)Oriental magpie (Pica sericea)Black-rumped magpie (Pica bottenensis)Genus UrocissaTaiwan blue magpie (Urocissa caerulea)Red-billed blue magpie (Urocissa erythrorhyncha)Yellow-billed blue magpie (Urocissa flavirostris)White-winged magpie (Urocissa whiteheadi)Sri Lanka blue magpie (Urocissa ornata)Genus CissaCommon green magpie (Cissa chinensis)Indochinese green magpie (Cissa hypoleuca)Javan green magpie (Cissa thalassina)Bornean green magpie (Cissa jefferyi)Genus CyanopicaAzure-winged magpie (Cyanopica cyanus)Iberian magpie (Cyanopica cooki)There are also some species of birds that are confused for magpies. The black magpies, belonging to the genus Platysmurus, are actually treepies, but look very similar to magpies.The Australian magpie (Cracticus tibicen), although similar in appearance to a Eurasian magpie with a black and white plumage, is actually a member of the family Artamidae and not a corvid. Magpie-robins, which are members of the genus Copsychus, have a similar black and white appearance, but are again not actually magpies and are instead Old World flycatchers.Magpie SpeciesThere are at least eighteen species of magpie, split into four genera. Here is some more information about each species in further detail.",
            "eurasian magpie": "The Eurasian magpie (Pica pica), also known as the common magpie, is found throughout the northern part of the Eurasian continent, from Portugal, Spain and Ireland in the west to the Kamchatka Peninsula. It is one of only two magpies found in Europe \u2014 the other is the Iberian magpie (Cyanopica cooki), which is limited to the Iberian Peninsula.This magpie is usually around 44 to 46 cm (17 to 18 in) in length, of which more than half is the tail, although females are smaller than males. They have a wingspan between 52 and 62 cm (20 and 24 in). The head, neck and breast are glossy black with a metallic green and violet sheen, the belly and shoulder feathers are pure white, and the wings are black, glossed with green or purple.The Eurasian magpie is believed not only to be among the most intelligent of birds but among the most intelligent of all animals. It is the only bird known to pass the mirror test, along with very few other non-avian species.There are six subspecies of the Eurasian magpie, and it is almost identical in appearance to the black-billed magpie (Pica hudsonia).

            "image": "https://animalcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/manatee5-1-340x200.jpg",
            "desc": "The manatee, belongs to the family Trichechidae and is a fully aquatic marine mammal. Sometimes known as sea cows, they make up three of four of the order of Sirenia. The Sirenia currently comprise two distinct families: Dugongidae (the dugong and the now extinct Steller\u2019s sea cow) and Trichechidae. Within the Trichechidae family, there is the Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis), the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), and the West African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis). These wonderful animals are really interesting to look at, and even more interesting to learn about. Keep reading on to find out all you need to know about the manatee.",
            "lifespan": "Manatees have been known to live for up to 60 years.",
            "diet": "Manatees are herbivores and eat over 60 different freshwater and saltwater plants. In fact, they eat between 100 to 150 pounds of underwater greens a day and, because they are large, they must feed for almost half of the day. This equates to them eating around 10 to 15 percent of their body weight every day. Manatees have been known to eat small numbers of fish from nets.To gather food, they use their flippers to \u201cwalk\u201d along the bottom whilst they dig for plants and roots. When they find a plant, they use their flippers to scrape the plant towards their mouth, and their lips, which the upper half of is split, use seven muscles to move.\u00a0",
            "behavior": "Manatees are slow-moving animals and are very gentle. They are generally solitary animals and spend their days eating, resting, and traveling. Around 50% of their time is spent sleeping. It has been said that, if you spot a group of manatees, it is likely to be a mating hard because they usually swim alone or in pairs. When they are in pairs or groups, they sometimes use their flippers to touch and soothe each other.Because they are mammals, they must surface every so often for air. This usually happens every three to five minutes, but if they are using a lot of energy, it could be as often as every thirty seconds. On the flip side, if a manatee is resting, they have been known to stay submerged for as long as twenty minutes! When they do take a breath, 90 percent of the air in their lungs is replaced! Humans only replace about 10 percent.A manatee usually stays just below the surface of the water, at depths of around 1\u20132 m (3 ft 3 in\u20136 ft 7 in), which is often the reason they are hit by boats and have collisions with other vessels.While these mammals are mostly slow-moving, they can be swift, too. They usually travel as a pace of about 5 miles per hour (8 kilometers per hour), but can go as fast as 15 miles per hour (24 kilometers per hour). They also have a very good long term memory.Healthy manatees have no natural predators, although alligators, crocodiles and sharks may prey on young or weak manatees. They are also hunted for their meat in West Africa. When threatened, the manatee\u2019s response is to dive as deeply as it can, which suggests that their biggest threat comes from boats and humans instead of other sea creatures.\u00a0",
            "breeding": "Manatees breed around once every two years and normally only one calf is born. Their gestation period is around 12 months and it takes around 12 to 18 months to wean a calf. Females may be courted by around 12 different males, and, once a male has mated, he has no part in raising the young.Newborns can swim about an hour after they are born. They become mature at about five years old.\u00a0HabitatManatees live in coastal waters, slow-moving rivers, estuaries, lagoons and saltwater bays, and will migrate to warm waters in the winter. African manatees live along rivers and coasts of western Africa, the Amazon manatee lives in the Amazon River\u2019s drainage, from the headwaters in Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador to the mouth of the Amazon in Brazil, and the West Indian or American manatee lives in the southern and eastern US, often Florida.Both West African and West Indian manatees need water that is at least 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.6 degrees Celsius), which is down to the fact they have a low metabolic rate and minimal fat layer. These two species also have an internal regulation system that works with the kidneys to keep salt concentrations at manageable levels, which allows them to live in both salt water and fresh water. On the other hand, Amazon manatees are restricted to fresh water.\u00a0Conservation StatusUnfortunately, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species lists all three species as vulnerable and decreasing in numbers.Manatees were actually among the first creatures listed on the Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966. Luckily, over the years, conservation efforts has decreased the manatee mortality rate and allowed them to be declared as \u201cvulnerable\u201d, which means they are still protected under the Endangered Species Act, but not considered \u201cendangered\u201d.The population is affected by climate change, pollution, and human activities. They need clean oceans and areas of sea with boat speed zones to continue to help them thrive.\u00a0",
            "fun fact!": "Because algae thrives in wet areas with lots of sunlight and manatees swim just below the surface of the water, the manatee\u2019s back is an ideal breeding ground for algae! Fortunately, algae helps to block out harmful rays from the sun.\u00a0",
            "summary points:": "They have a streamlined body \u2013 full around the middle and narrowing to a paddle-shaped tail.Manatees are a greyish-brown color, however, Amazonian manatees usually have white or pink patches on the belly and chest. Organisms such as algae, which may grow on the skin of these slow-moving individuals, help determine their coloration.They have two small pectoral flippers on their upper body which are used for steering. These flexible flippers may also be used for bringing food to the manatees mouth and for guiding movement along a waterways bottom.Manatee flippers have five digits that are covered by a thick layer of skin. This bone structure is similar to that of toothed whales, seals, and sea lions. They have no externally visible neck.They do not have external ear flaps and the opening to the ear canal is very small.They have two nostrils that lie on top of the head at the end of the snout.Manatees have a large flexible upper lip. Their lips help guide vegetation into their mouth. Vibrissae (whiskers) are found on the surface of this lip.The only teeth are 24 to 32 molars located in the back of the mouth.They swim by moving their large paddle like tail in an up-and-down motion.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "desc": "The Maned Wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) is the largest canid in South America. The Maned Wolf resembles a large dog with reddish fur. The Maned wolves distribution includes southern Brazil, Paraguay, Peru and Bolivia east of the Andes.",
            "reproduction": "Maned Wolves do not form packs like other wolves. Maned Wolves live in monogamous pairs (having one partner for life) and only interact during the breeding season. April marks the beginning of the breeding season. In August and early September mothers give birth to 2 \u2013 5 maned wolf pups. In captivity, males help raise pups by regurgitating food. Captive Maned wolves live between 12 \u2013 15 years. Little information is known about family habits of wild Maned wolves.",
            "diet": "Whereas other large canids hunt cooperatively to capture ungulate prey, Maned wolves specialize in small prey. At night Maned Wolves search for rodents, hares and birds. Fruits are a large fraction of their diet. Most interestingly of all, a large portion of the diet, over 50%, according to some studies, is made of fruits and plant matter, especially Wolf Apples, the tomato-like fruit of Solanum lycocarpum. Captive maned wolves were traditionally fed meat-heavy diets and developed kidney stones. Zoo diets now feature fruits and vegetables, as well as meat and dog chow.",
            "behaviour": "Maned wolves are nocturnal (most active in the night) preferring to rest under forest cover during the day and hunt until sunrise. Contrary to popular opinion, Maned wolves are very shy and only attack humans when they feel threatened or afraid. (For more information see Wolf Behaviour).",
            "habitat": "Maned wolves live in the South American grasslands and scrub forests of Brazil, northern Argentina, Paraguay, eastern Bolivia and southeastern Peru.",
            "conservation status": "Habitat destruction through agricultural development threatens Maned wolves. The effects of agriculture, overgrazing by cattle, annual burning of pasture and soil erosion leave less food and territory for Maned wolves. Maned wolves cannot meet and mate with other Maned wolves when they are isolated from each other. Sometimes Maned wolves are killed by ranchers when they try to eat domestic chickens, a convenient food. It is estimated that there are between 4500 \u2013 2200 Maned wolves. The Maned wolf is one of the many species maintained at the National Zoos Conservation and Research Centre that participate in cooperative breeding programs under the auspices of the American Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA)."

            "image": "https://animalcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/the-Mantis-Shrimp-340x200.png",
            "desc": "Mantis shrimps, also known as stomatopods, comprise the order Stomatopoda. They are carnivorous marine crustaceans with more than 450 species known. They also belong to the group Crustacea, which are hard-shelled animals, such as crabs, lobsters, crayfish, shrimp, krill. Mantis shrimps typically grow to around 10 cm (3.9 in) in length and range in color from shades of brown to vivid colors. They are most commonly found in U shaped burrows at the base of coral reefs. Depending on the species, they can be active during the day or entirely nocturnal. Some mantis shrimp species have specialized \u201cclubs\u201d that can strike with great power, while others have sharp forelimbs used to seize the prey, which is where the species gets the term \u201cmantis\u201d in its common name. They are also thought to have the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom and have the most complex visual system ever discovered.",
            "appendages": "Species of mantis shrimp can be divided based on their second pair of thoracic appendages. These have been highly adapted for powerful close-range attacks, and group mantis shrimp into two main types: spearers and smashers.Spearers have spiny appendages which are used to impale their prey. Smashers, on the other hand, have a much more developed club that allow them to deliver a powerful blow to their prey. The inner part of the club appendage also possesses a sharp edge, which is used to cut prey while the mantis shrimp swims.Beneath their hard coated clubs, mantis shrimp have special layers of elastic polysaccharide chitin, which are positioned in a way to act as shock absorbers. This structure is called a bouligand structure.Both these types of appendages allow the mantis shrimp to prey on animals much larger than them. Their punch is so fast it results in \u2018cavitation\u2019 bubbles. This is a super heated bubble and small flash of light, which for split seconds also generates a temperature of 4,400c, nearly as hot as the sun, in the surrounding water. When the bubbles collapses they cause an intense shockwave which is like a double punch and can stun, dismember or kill prey instantly, even if the mantis shrimp misses the target!",
            "eyes": "Another unique and interesting feature of the mantis shrimp is its eyes. Their eyes are thought to be the most complex in the animal kingdom, with great color and depth perception, as well as polarisation sensitivity, making their brains more efficient.The eyes of the mantis shrimp are mounted on mobile stalks and can move independently of each other. While humans have three types of photoreceptor cells, mantis shrimp have 12 to 16 types of photoreceptor cells. It is believed that mantis shrimp can take all visual information into their brains immediately without having to process it, allowing them to react instantly to the environment.Each mantis shrimp eye has \u2018trinocular vision\u2019, which means it can gauge depth and distance on its own by focusing on objects with three separate regions. They can see a special spiralling type of light called circularly polarised light that\u2019s not been documented in any other animal.",
            "lifespan": "In the wild, a mantis shrimp usually live for between three to six years on average, but with proper care and diet, these species tend to live longer in captivity.",
            "diet": "The diet of the mantis shrimp can vary from species to species, and depends on whether the species is a spearer or a smasher. Smashers can attack crabs, snails, rock oysters, and other molluscs, while spearers prefer the meat of softer animals, such as fish, squid, worms and octopus.Smashers use their blunt clubs to crack the shells of their prey into pieces. This group actively searches and pursues their prey outside of their home burrow.Spearers use their barbed claws to slice and snag the softer meat of their prey. They prefer to use ambush as their hunting strategy. They hide within a burrow and swiftly strike out when prey wanders too close.",
            "behavior": "Mantis shrimp are aggressive and typically solitary sea creatures that spend most of their time hiding in rock formations or burrowing passageways in the sea bed. They rarely leave their homes except to feed and relocate, and can be active during the day, nocturnal, or crepuscular (active at twilight), depending on the species. Unlike most crustaceans, they sometimes hunt, chase, and kill prey.The mantis shrimp is highly intelligent. They exhibit complex social behaviour, with ritualized fighting and protective activities. Some species use fluorescent patterns on their bodies for signalling with their own and maybe even other species. They can recognize others by visual signs and even by individual smell.",
            "reproduction": "Some mantis shrimp are monogamous and can remain with the same partner for up to 20 years. However, in some species, the males and females only come together to mate.In a lifetime, they can have as many as 20 or 30 breeding episodes. Both sexes often take care of the eggs (bi-parental care). In other species, the female looks after the eggs while the male hunts for both of them. After the eggs hatch, the offspring may spend up to three months as plankton.\u00a0Mantis Shrimp Location and HabitatMantis shrimp can be found in nearly every sea. While some mantis shrimp live in temperate seas, most species live in tropical and subtropical waters in the Indian and Pacific Oceans between eastern Africa and Hawaii.They live in burrows, where they spend the majority of their time. The two different categories of shrimp \u2014 smashing and spearing \u2014 have different preferences of location for burrowing. The spearing type build their habitat in soft sediments and the smashing species make burrows in hard substrata or coral cavities.Mantis shrimp use their burrows for consuming their prey, as well as for mating and for keeping their eggs safe. As these shrimp grow, they may need to find new habitats to live in to fit their size. However, some spearing species can modify their pre-existing habitat if the burrow is made of silt or mud and expand it to fit them.\u00a0Mantis Shrimp Conservation StatusMantis shrimps are considered widespread throughout their range and, therefore, are not thought to be threatened or endangered. They are, however, caught for both food and for the aquarium trade.",
            "in aquariums": "Some species of mantis shrimp are highly desired for keeping in aquariums, because of their unique colors. However, these animals require special, stronger aquariums. Their strength can result in live rock and glass breakage. They have also been known to attack their own reflection through the aquarium glass, and attack other animals living in the tank with them.",
            "as food": "In some parts of the world, mantis shrimp is considered a delicacy. In Japan, Japanese mantis shrimp (Oratosquilla oratoria) is known as shako (\u30b7\u30e3\u30b3, \u8766\u86c4) and eaten as sushi. They are also caught in Vietnam, China, the Mediterranean and the Philippines as food.",
            "predators": "Mantis shrimp do not have many natural predators. The biggest predators are those that can swallow the mantis shrimp whole, such as sharks and orcas. In reality, the biggest prey on mantis shrimp are humans.\u00a0Mantis Shrimp Fun FactsThe peacock mantis shrimp has been recorded striking at speeds up to 23 meters per second, which is the equivalent of a .22 caliber gun!They are one of the only animals that can hunt the deadly blue-ringed octopus.The eyes of mantis shrimp can detect both cancer and neuron activity.Mantis shrimps have been around for nearly 400 million years!\u00a0Mantis Shrimp TaxonomyMantis shrimp belong to the order Stomatopoda, with all living species in the suborder Unipeltata. The order Stomatopoda is the only order in the subclass Hoplocarida, which belongs to the much larger class Malacostraca. Malacostraca is the largest of the six classes of crustaceans, containing about 40,000 living species.There are around 450 species of mantis shrimp, which belong to seven superfamilies, broken down into 17 families. Take a look at the breakdown of these superfamilies and families below.BathysquilloideaBathysquillidaeIndosquillidaeGonodactyloideaAlainosquillidaeHemisquillidaeGonodactylidaeOdontodactylidaeProtosquillidaePseudosquillidaeTakuidaeErythrosquilloideaErythrosquillidaeLysiosquilloideaCoronididaeLysiosquillidaeNannosquillidaeTetrasquillidaeSquilloideaSquillidaeEurysquilloideaEurysquillidaeParasquilloideaParasquillidae\u00a0Mantis Shrimp SpeciesWith around 450 species of mantis shrimp, it would be impossible to name all of them here. However, we can take a look at some of the most common types of mantis shrimp, and what superfamily and family they belong to. Some of these have common names, while others do not.Peacock mantis shrimpSuperfamily: GonodactyloideaFamily: OdontodactylidaeGenus: OdontodactylusSpecies: Odontodactylus scyllarusThe peacock mantis shrimp, also known as the harlequin mantis shrimp, painted mantis shrimp, clown mantis shrimp or rainbow mantis shrimp, is found in the Indo-Pacific, ranging from Guam to East Africa, and as far South as Northern KwaZulu Natal in South Africa.It is a large mantis shrimp, ranging in size from 3 to 18 cm (1.2 to 7.1 in). They are primarily green with orange legs and leopard-like spots on the anterior carapace. This mantis shrimp is a smasher, with club-shaped raptorial appendages.The peacock mantis shrimp is kept by some saltwater aquarists. Other aquarists consider them harmful pests because they will eat other inhabitants in the tank.Zebra mantis shrimpSuperfamily: LysiosquilloideaFamily: LysiosquillidaeGenus: LysiosquillinaSpecies: Lysiosquillina maculataThe zebra mantis shrimp, also known as the striped mantis shrimp or razor mantis, is found cross the Indo-Pacific region from East Africa to the Gal\u00e1pagos and Hawaiian Islands.This mantis shrimp is the largest mantis shrimp in the world, measuring at a length of up to 40 cm. The zebra mantis shrimp is a spearer shrimp and has a spring and latch structure at the base of their raptorial appendages that allows them to create a spring-loaded strike when hunting.Purple spot mantis shrimpSuperfamily: GonodactyloideaFamily: GonodactylidaeGenus: GonodactylusSpecies: Gonodactylus smithiiThe purple spot mantis shrimp is found from New Caledonia to the western part of the Indian Ocean, including Australia\u2019s north coast and the Great Barrier Reef.This species of mantis shrimp is a smasher. They can be green to dark green with red raptorial dactyls and yellow antennal scales, although also often have a maroon body color. The distinguishing feature, that gives the species its name, is a purple metal spot on the body.Japanese mantis shrimpSuperfamily: SquilloideaFamily: SquillidaeGenus: OratosquillaSpecies: Oratosquilla oratoriaThe Japanese mantis shrimp is found in the Western Pacific, in the oceans near Korea, Japan, Taiwan, China, and Vietnam, at depths of 10 to 100 metres (33 to 328 ft).This mantis shrimp is light grey to light brown with dark red grooves running down the thorax and abdomen. It grows to a length of 185 millimetres (7.3 in). It is considered to be a type in between spearer and smashers.The Japanese mantis shrimp is widely harvested in Japan where it is known as shako (\u30b7\u30e3\u30b3, \u8766\u86c4) and eaten as sushi. It is most tasty during the period of spring as it is their breeding season and is occasionally also eaten with its roe.Common mantis shrimpSuperfamily: ParasquilloideaFamily: PseudosquillidaeGenus: PseudosquillaSpecies: Pseudosquilla ciliataThe common mantis shrimp, also known as the rainbow mantis shrimp or false mantis shrimp, is found in the tropical Indo-Pacific region and in both the western and eastern Atlantic Ocean, from from the lower shore down to a depth of at least 86 m (282 ft).The color of this mantis shrimp varies greatly depending on its environment \u2014 those living in a sea grass flat will often turn green, while those living in coralline algae will often turn red. they may also range from yellowish to near black in color and may be plain, marbled or striped. This mantis shrimp can reach total length of 95 millimetres (3.7 in). It is a spearer mantis shrimp.The common mantis shrimp is sometimes kept in reef aquaria where it is hardy and safe with larger gastropods and crabs.Philippine mantis shrimpSuperfamily: GonodactyloideaFamily: GonodactylidaeGenus: GonodactylaceusSpecies: Gonodactylaceus falcatusThe Philippine mantis shrimp is found in the Indo-Pacific and Hawaiian Islands. It may grow to about 6 cm in length and is generally dark green or reddish brown in color. It is a smasher mantis shrimp.Green mantis shrimpSuperfamily: GonodactyloideaFamily: GonodactylidaeGenus: GonodactylellusSpecies: Gonodactylellus viridisThe green mantis shrimp is found in the Western Pacific and eastern Indian Ocean, from the Andaman sea to Samoa and Japan. It resides in very shallow waters, up to 2 m in depth.The color of the mantis shrimp can vary based on where its habitat is \u2014 it can be green from reef and grass flats, white from sand flats, and red from coralline algae \u2014 and frequently has fine white spots. It is a smasher.The green mantis shrimp is kept in aquariums; it is occasionally shipped by collectors in Indonesia where it is a common reef flat species.Caribbean striped mantis shrimpSuperfamily: LysiosquilloideaFamily: LysiosquillidaeGenus: LysiosquillinaSpecies: Lysiosquillina glabriusculaThe Caribbean striped mantis shrimp is found in the Caribbean, from South Carolina to Panama and Brazil and resides from shallow depths to at least 40 m deep.This mantis shrimp is a spearer and can either be striped pale cream and tan or tan and brown in color. It measures between 15 and 22 cm in length. The Caribbean striped mantis shrimp is rarely found in aquariums because it can be difficult to take care of.Squilla empusaSuperfamily: SquilloideaFamily: SquillidaeGenus: SquillaSpecies: Squilla empusaSquilla empusa is found in coastal areas of the western Atlantic Ocean, with a range extending from Cape Cod to the Gulf of Mexico. It is also reported from Brazil and the Mediterranean Sea. It lives in a U-shaped burrow in soft sediment on the seabed at depths from the intertidal zone down to about 150 m (500 ft).This mantis shrimp grows to a length of around 30 cm (12 in). It is a spearer shrimp.Gonodactylus chiragraSuperfamily: GonodactyloideaFamily: GonodactylidaeGenus: GonodactylusSpecies: Gonodactylus chiragraGonodactylus chiragra is distributed widely throughout the West Indo-Pacific, in shallow water in the upper intertidal zone around boulders and coral heads where prey is available. It is a medium to large mantis shrimp, growing to a maximum length of 105 millimetres. Males range in color from brown to a dark green, and females from a grey/green to white.This mantis shrimp is a smasher with clubs on their second pair of thoracic appendages. They are one of the largest smashers and employ a unique fighting strategy in which they circle around the target and aim at the head.Gonodactylus chiragra is considered one of the most aggressive species of mantis shrimp and when in captivity, routinely strike glass walls and air tubes in the aquarium.Neogonodactylus curacaoensisSuperfamily: GonodactyloideaFamily: GonodactylidaeGenus: NeogonodactylusSpecies: Neogonodactylus curacaoensisNeogonodactylus curacaoensis is found in the Caribbean, from Florida to Panama and Curacao. It inhabits coral reefs, at depths from 3 to 50 m.This mantis shrimp ranges in size from 7 to 70 mm and is brown, olive or light green in color. It has white spots on its back and is a smasher.Neogonodactylus curacaoensis is occasionally kept in aquariums, although can be somewhat difficult. It is very shy and requires very stable, good water parameters.Squilla mantisSuperfamily: SquilloideaFamily: SquillidaeGenus: SquillaSpecies: Squilla mantisSquilla mantis is found in shallow coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea and the Eastern Atlantic Ocean.This mantis shrimp is a spearer, and grows up to 200 millimetres (8 in) long. It is generally dull brown in color, but has two brown eye spots, circled in white, at the base of the telson.Thanks to its abundance, Squilla mantis is the only commercially fished mantis shrimp in the Mediterranean. Other species \u2014 including smashers \u2014 are also sold in the aquarium trade as Squilla mantis.Hemisquilla californiensisSuperfamily: GonodactyloideaFamily: HemisquillidaeGenus: HemisquillaSpecies: Hemisquilla californiensisHemisquilla californiensis is found in California, around Santa Barbara. It lives at depths of between 10 and 50 m.At 3.5 to 32 cm long, this species of mantis shrimp is largest of all smashers. It is brown with blue walking legs and antennules, yellow raptorial appendages and blue uropods with red setae.In spring, Hemisquilla californiensis is occasionally taken by trawlers and sold commercially for food. It can be an aquarium species, but is hard to keep.Rissoides desmarestiSuperfamily: SquilloideaFamily: SquillidaeGenus: RissoidesSpecies: Rissoides desmarestiRissoides desmaresti is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. It is one of only two species of stomatopod found around the British Isles, and one of twelve species in the Mediterranean. It lives in burrows below from the subtidal zone down to depths of around 40 metres (130 ft).Rissoides desmaresti has a flattened body and may reach a size of 70 millimetres (2.8 in). It is a spearer mantis shrimp.Gonodactylaceus ternatensisSuperfamily: GonodactyloideaFamily: GonodactylidaeGenus: GonodactylaceusSpecies: Gonodactylaceus ternatensisGonodactylaceus ternatensis is found in the Central Pacific to southern China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and Australia. It usually resides in bright, shallow waters up to 10 m in depth.These mantis shrimp reach a length of between 8 and 120 mm and are the largest species of gonodactylid. They are sexually color dimorphic; the body of both sexes is dark green with red inter-segmental stripes, but males have blue antennal scales and uropods, while females have orange or yellow antennal scales and uropods. It is a smasher.Gonodactylaceus ternatensis is suitable for an aquarium but can be aggressive and break coral. One concern is that this species is often collected from live coral heads that may be destroyed in the collecting process.Odontodactylus japonicusSuperfamily: GonodactyloideaFamily: OdontodactylidaeGenus: OdontodactylusSpecies: Odontodactylus japonicusOdontodactylus japonicus is found in the Indo-West Pacific, from the western Indian Ocean to Australia and Japan. It resides at depths of between 30 and 100 m deep.This mantis shrimp measures between 2 and 17 cm in length, with the body of males being a salmon color and the body of females also salmon, but with a greenish tint on the abdomen. They are a smasher species.Odontodactylus japonicus are good as aquarium pets, but those larger than 13 cm may chip or break the glass. They also dig constantly and will rearrange landscaping.\u00a0"

Around the British Isles, it is the most commonly sighted of the shearwaters, The prefix Manx, meaning from the Isle of Man, originated owing to the once large colony of Manx Shearwaters found on the Calf of Man (a small island just south of the Isle of Man).",
            "manx shearwater description": "The Manx Shearwater measures around 30 \u2013 35 centimetres in length and has a wingspan of 71 \u2013 83 centimetres. The plumage of the manx shearwater is sharply divided into dark, glossy brown upperparts and greyish-white underparts. Their beak is quite long and slender, hooked and grey in color.Manx Shearwaters have tube-shaped nostrils that excrete salt taken in with seawater. Both male and female are similar in appearance. Their wings are very slender and positioned almost at right-angles to the body when in full flight. The position of their wings allow them to soar with maximum efficiency, meaning they are able to travel vast distances between feeding grounds and stay at sea for many months. Shearwaters can appear awkward and cumbersome when walking on land.",
            "manx shearwater habitats": "Manx shearwaters nest in burrows and therefore prefer cliff slopes that have large stretches of turf.",
            "manx shearwater diet": "The Manx Shearwater feeds on small fish, particularly herring, sprat and sardines. They also eat sand eels, squid, crustaceans, cephalopods and surface offal. Shearwaters forage individually or in small flocks and they make use of feeding marine mammals and schools of predatory fish, which push prey species up to the surface. Shearwaters scavenge from fishing boats occasionally.",
            "manx shearwater behaviour": "The Manx shearwater is a gregarious species, which can been seen in large numbers from boats or headlands, especially on passage in autumn. It is silent at sea, however, at night the breeding colonies are alive with raucous cackling calls.All the Shearwaters are long travelers. Manx Shearwaters migrate over 10,000 kilometres to South America in the winter. This long journey means this bird has covered a minimum of 1,000,000 kilometres on migration alone (not counting day-to-day fishing trips). One particular shearwater was \u2018ringed\u2019 in 1957 and breeding on Bardsey Island off Wales. It was calculated by ornithologist Chris Mead to have flown over 8 million kilometres (5 million miles) during its life (this bird was still alive in 2008). This shearwater has now exceeded the age record for any known living European bird surpassing the \u2018Copeland Island bird\u2019 by at least a year making it at least 56 years old.",
            "manx shearwater reproduction": "Manx Shearwaters breed in the North Atlantic, with major colonies on islands and coastal cliffs around Britain and Ireland. They nest in burrows. The burrow is usually found in soft grassy earth on the offshore islands around the British coastline. The female shearwater lays one white egg which is only visited at night to avoid predators such as large gulls, adults are off at sea for most of the day. This technique works as shearwaters are extraordinarily long-lived. In the process of rearing their single chick, parent birds may travel as far as six hundred miles offshore to seek food. Both parents feed it with regurgitated food. Shearwaters are monogamous which means they pair for life.Breeding colonies are often huge and are especially active when parent birds return to their nests for the night. It is at this time that the adults utter their characteristic, eerie cooing calls. Manx Shearwaters reside in breeding sites along the western coast of the British Isles. During the deep winter months many of these birds travel across the Atlantic Ocean to spend time on the coast of South America, returning to British waters in February.",

Masai giraffes can be distinguished from Reticulated Giraffes because they have jagged spots on their bodies instead of polygonal liver-colored spots. Originally, the Masai giraffe lived throughout Africa, however, due to loss of habitat and deforestation, they are only found in the savannas of Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and Tanzania. ",
            "characteristics": "A female Masai giraffe has thick head hair, however, a male Masai giraffe is bald on top. Both males and female Masai giraffes have skin-covered horns called ossicones. Masai Giraffes have the usual long legs and a long neck with special valves used to control the flow of blood to the head.Masai Giraffes coat is covered in irregular star-shaped patches and is buff-colored below the knee. As with all giraffes, the spots on the coat act like human fingerprints, no two patterns are the same and they can be used to identify an individual.The male Masai Giraffe grows to a height of 19 feet (5.5 metres), and the females 16 feet (4.8 metres). The males weigh 2475 \u2013 4275 pounds (1100 \u2013 1900 kilograms) and the females 1575 \u2013 2700 pounds (700 \u2013 1200 kilograms).

They consume large quantities of leaves, twigs, sprouts, flowers, fruits and bark. Masai Giraffes mainly feed off whistling-thorn acacia trees, using their long lips and tongues to reach between the thorns to extract the leaves.Masai giraffes have a four- chambered stomach and can chew their own cud. If fresh vegetation is available in large quantities they can go without water for weeks, extracting it from their food. Male Masai giraffes eat from the top branches, the females from the bottom branches.",

It has a curved neck and a sharp, thick, pointed orange/yellow beak. Males have a small horn at the base of the beak.As its name suggests, both male and female finfoots have a black facial mask and eyebrow which contrasts with a white eyering and neck marking. The lower half of the neck is grey and it\u2019s breast is pale grey. The back, tail and wings are a rich brown color. Males have a black chin while females have a white chin.The finfoots legs and feet have yellow and black stripes and it has been speculated that, as these colors are not involved in any behavioural displays, they may be some kind of warning to underwater predators. Yellow and black stripes are one of natures classic deterrents as seen in wasps, caterpillars and snakes.",
            "masked finfoot habitat": "The Masked Finfoot is adapted for a variety of aquatic habitats such as brackish wetlands, mangrove swamps and lowland riverine forests, as well as forests and savanna woodlands. It has been recorded in both coastal and inland wetlands, such as tidal creeks and flooded forests.",
            "masked finfoot diet": "The Masked Finfoot is an opportunisic feeder. Its diet consists of aquatic invertebrates such as Mayfly and Mayfly larvae, Dragonflies and crustaceans. They will also eat snails, fish and amphibians.Finfoots will also take prey off the waters surface and being skilled out of the water as well as in, they will also forage on river banks.",
            "masked finfoot behaviour": "Masked Finfoots are not gregarious birds and are only usually observed in pairs or singular. Although it is adapted for aquatic surroundings, it is quite competent on land.The masked finfoot can run quite fast on land and even clamber into trees and is quite agile at manouevring through the branches. The reason why these birds are quite flexible on land is due to their feet not being fully webbed. Instead, their feet are lobed like in Grebes and Coots. This enables the finfoot to be competent in water by using its lobed feet to propel itself through the water and yet unrestricted on land.Masked Finfoots are vocal birds and produce a rather high-pitched bubbling sound during courtship, sometimes followed by clucks.",
            "masked finfoot reproduction": "The breeding habits of the Masked Finfoot are fairly unknown as it is such a secretive bird. They are so elusive that even experienced ornithologists do not fully understand their behaviour or if they spend more time in the water than on land.It is thought that breeding coincides with the rainy seasons. Nests are a pad-shaped structure of small sticks that is constrcuted above the water. Females lay 5 \u2013 7 eggs into the nests. Finfoot chicks leave the nest shortly after hatching. Life span is unknown.",
            "masked finfoot conservation status": "The Masked Finfoot is classed as \u2018Endangered\u2018 and are still declining in numbers. This elusive species has a very small, and very rapidly declining population. Fewer than 2,500 birds are thought to populate the world. Threats include habitat loss and human disturbances.

When standing on their hind legs, meerkats measure around 30 centimetres (12 inches) high.Meerkats are more slender than many mongoose and have pointed snouts. Their fur is silvery brown and they have irregular dark stripes on their rumps which are unique to each meerkat.The underside of the meerkat has no markings but the belly has a patch which is only sparsely covered with hair and shows the black skin underneath. The meerkat uses this area to absorb heat while standing on its rear legs, usually early in the morning after cold desert nights.Their faces are white with dark markings around their eyes (which helps deflects the suns glare). Their ears are crescent shaped and can close when digging in order to keep sand out of them. Unlike most mongoose, meerkats have 5 instead of 4 toes on each paw.Their eyes are situated on the front of their faces and, like cats, they have binocular vision, a large peripheral range and depth perception (although they seem to have a problem with this, not being able to focus within 20 feet (6 metres) of themselves).Meerkats remove sand from their eyes by blinking. Between the eye and eye lid there is a white membrane called the nictitating membrane. This membrane acts as a windshield wiper and removes sand from their eyes with every blink.Meerkats have strong, non-retractable claws that measure 2 centimetres (0.8 inches) long. These claws are curved and used for digging underground burrows and digging for prey. Their claws are also used in conjunction with their muscular hind legs to occasionally climb trees.\u00a0",

If the latter occurs, the weaker mob will then try to expand in another direction or wait until they become stronger and reclaim their lost burrow.Each mob also has what is called a \u2018sentry\u2019 who watches over the mob and is there to spot danger and warn the other members when threats are posed. The sentry either watches from the ground or climbs a tree or bush to look out.The sentry watches over both the burrow system as well as when the other members of the mob are foraging for food. The sentry will give out a loud bark when danger is perceived and the mob will then bolt quickly to their hiding holes.Meerkats like to groom each other and will remove parasites from a grooming partner which are eaten, although these are not part of their normal diet.Meerkats typically stand on their hind legs or even their toes to sniff the wind to detect attacking vultures. They have excellent vision and are capable of 10 different vocalisations including an alarm bark. They are intelligent animals that are not endangered and thrive in their environment.\u00a0",

Both female and male care for, groom and guard and protect their young.Young meerkats are born with hair but not full coats and with their eyes closed. When the young are 4 \u2013 6 weeks old, they begin to forage the their parents to obtain nourishment from both milk from their mother and insects. At 6 \u2013 16 weeks, the young are weaned and find their own food.During this time, an adult meerkat will take responsibility of a pup and teach it to forage and be alert to danger. Meerkats reach sexual maturity at 10 months and adulthood at 11 months. Meerkats may stay with their original mob before venturing out on the own.

Until recent times, the Mexican Wolf ranged the Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts from central Mexico to western Texas, southern New Mexico and central Arizona. By the the turn of the century, reduction of natural prey like deer and elk caused many Mexican Wolves to begin attacking domestic livestock, which led to intensive efforts by government agencies and individuals to eradicate the Mexican Wolf. Mexican wolves prefer to live in mountain forests, grasslands and shrub lands.",

All members of the pack care for the pups, who are fed regurgitated meat after hunts.Pups are weaned at about the fifth week and approach adult size by early winter. By autumn, pups are capable of traveling with the adults and the pack hunts as a unit throughout its territory. Mexican Wolf pups remain with the pack until they reach sexual maturity at about 2 years, after which they may leave to search for a mate and establish new territories, or remain in their pack as helpers. The approximate life span of the Mexican Wolf is 16 years in captivity, rather less in the wild.",

A hierarchy of dominant and subordinate animals within the pack help it to work as a unit. (For more information see Wolf Behaviour).",
            "conservation": "Humans and habitat destruction are the only major threats to wolves. In March 1997, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior authorized the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to begin reintroducing Mexican Wolves into the Blue Range area of Arizona. The overall objective of this program was to re-establish 100 Mexican Wolves in the Apache and Gila National Forests of Arizona and New Mexico by 2005. This has not been successful and the Mexican Wolf remains a critically endangered species with only 15 or less living in the wild today."

Male mice are allowed to visit the female areas when he pleases.Although male mice will behave sociable towards female mice, they can be unsociable towards other male mice where territory is concerned. Like a majority of male animals, the male mouse will protect his territory and guard it well, chasing off any other male mouse intruders. Female mice will also defend their own territories.",
            "mouse behaviour in captivity:": "Mice in captivity (or kept as pets, domestic or for breeding), show small changes in their behaviour. Female mice are more sociable in captivity than in the wild. If you were to keep several female mice together, they would not fight. In fact, if 2 or 3 females gave birth to litters at the same time, they would put their babies in one heap and share responsibilities with feeding and caring for them. The individuals would of course give birth in their own corners and spend the first few hours alone with their own litters.This is obviously not the female mouses natural behaviour.Male mice show their natural territorial behaviour also in captivity. It is not wise to keep males together. However, males are social rodents and need company, therefore, they would live a lot happier if paired with a female.One behaviour pattern that is different between wild male mice and captive male mice is there paternal instinct. Captive male mice will help rear the young. They will lay on them and keep them warm while the female rests and eats. This paternal behaviour in the male mouse has not been observed in the wild but then again if they have this instinct in captivity then it possibly could happen in the wild.",
            "get lonely?": "As a matter of fact, mice do get lonely. As mice are social animals, they are better kept in pairs, but as mentioned before, male mice are better living with female mice and not another male. Females of course, will live together. A lone male mouse could be very sad and its health might suffer as a consequence. But then again, pairing him with a female will no doubt result in a pregnancy and not just the once either. A problem worth some serious consideration.",
            "do not despair over your mouse!": "Although it is common for two male mice to squabble if put together, some, if you are lucky, will live together quite happily. However, another solution for a lonely male mouse is to place an older or sterile female with him. There will probably be no baby production here. Another option is to place a castrated male mouse with the lonely male mouse. Castrated male mice are more acceptable to intact male mice probably because they are less aggressive and are seen as a lesser competitive."

As in many Longhorn Beetles, the antennae are situated very near the eye. In the Milkweed Beetle, this adaptation has been carried to an extreme as the antennae actually split each eye in two. The Milkweed Beetle is an herbivore. The Milkweed Beetle is given this name because they are generally host specific to the milkweed plant (Asclepias), meaning that they live on and eat from it. It is thought the beetle and its early instars derive a measure of protection from predators by incorporating toxins from the plant into their cell structures, thereby becoming distasteful, similar behaviour to the Monarch butterfly and its larvae."

            "desc": "Millipedes are arthropods in the class \u2018diplopoda\u2019. This class contains around 10,000 species, 15 orders and 115 families. Millipedes are found in most parts of the world from back gardens to Rainforests, on all continents except Antarctica. The Class Diplopoda is divided into three subclasses.",
            "millipede characteristics": "Millipedes are Myriapods, which means they have long segmented bodies, short heads and many pairs of legs, their numerous legs being their most obvious feature. The name Millipede derives from Latin roots, \u2018milli\u2019 meaning \u2018thousand\u2019 and \u2018ped\u2019 meaning foot. However, despite their name, these creatures do not have thousands of legs.Some rare species can have 750 legs, however, common species have between 80 and 400 legs. Millipedes have two pairs of legs attached to each segment of its body, except the very first segment behind the head and the next few segments which only have one pair of legs each. Each segment that has two pairs of legs is a result of two single segments being fused together as one. When Millipedes walk, each pair of legs is lifted at the same time, moving along in a wave motion.Millipede eyes consist of a number of simple flat lens ocelli arranged in a group on the front/side of the head. Millipedes have very poor eyesight which is sometimes nonexistent. They sense their way around by using their antennae which continually taps the ground as the millipede moves along. The head contains a pair of sensory organs found just behind their antennae and are oval shaped. They are probably used to measure the humidity in the surroundings.Millipedes are very clean creatures and spend a lot of time cleaning and polishing various parts of their body. They have a special brush-like group of hairs on the 2nd or 3rd pair of their legs which they use to clean their antennae.Most millipedes have very elongated cylinder shaped bodies, although some are flattened dorsoventrally (extending from the back to the belly), while Pill Millipedes are short and can roll into a ball. The giant African millipede (Archispirostreptus gigas) is one of the largest of the millipedes, growing up to 11 inches (28 centimetres) in length. It lives in tropical and subtropical Africa, in rotting plant life or moist earth and usually avoids light. It is black in color and is often kept as a pet.",
            "millipede diet": "Millipedes are detritivores (animals that consume decomposing organic material and in doing so contribute to decomposition and the recycling of nutrients). Most millipedes eat decaying leaves and other dead plant matter, moisturising the food with secretions and then scraping it in with the jaws.A few species are known to feed on animal remains or funguses. Many species will also eat their own waste pellets. It is believed that they obtain nutrition from funguses growing inside the pellets rather than from the waste itself.",
            "millipede behaviour and defence": "Having very many short legs makes millipedes rather slow, but they are powerful burrowers. With their legs and body length moving in a wavelike pattern, they easily force their way underground head first. They are able to reinforce their tunnels by rearranging the particles around it.Millipedes have a hard exoskeleton helps to protect them against predators. When threatened, they coil up into a ball to protect the more vulnerable underside. Many species also emit poisonous liquid secretions through microscopic pores along the sides of their bodies as a secondary defence. Some of these substances are caustic (substance that causes corrosion) and can burn the exoskeleton of ants and other insect predators. As far as humans are concerned, this liquid is fairly harmless, usually causing only minor effects on the skin, the main effect being discoloration but other effects may also include pain and itching.Most millipedes lack a waxy layer on the outside of their exoskeletons, or hard outer coverings, that helps to prevent the loss of body moisture. Like centipedes, millipedes spend most of their time in cool wet places and become active only at night or after it has been raining.",
            "millipede reproduction": "Males and females usually have to mate to produce offspring, with males usually depositing sperm directly into the reproductive organs of the female. There may or may not be any courtship behaviour. Bristly millipede males must first spin a web on which they deposit their sperm. The female then approaches the web and puts the sperm into her own reproductive organs. In some pill millipedes a male attracts a female to mate with squeaking noises made by rubbing the bases of his legs against his body. He then grasps the females body with his legs. A sperm packet is released behind his head and passed back from one pair of legs to the next, until it reaches the reproductive organs of the female. In other pill millipedes the male covers the sperm packet in dirt before passing it back with his legs to his mates reproductive organs.Millipedes lay their eggs in the soil. Some species make individual cases for their eggs out of chewed-up leaves. In some species, the female, and occasionally the male, guard the eggs until they hatch. Although young millipedes resemble small adults, they are usually have no legs when they first hatch from the egg.After they molt, or shed their exoskeleton for the first time, they have six body segments and three pairs of legs. They add additional body segments and pairs of legs with each molt until they reach the maximum adult number. Millipedes molt in sheltered places underground or in cracks in the soil. This is a very delicate stage of their lives. Millipedes reach adulthood in one or two years, sometimes longer. Adults live for one to eleven years, although some individuals may live longer.",
            "millipede history": "This class of arthropods is thought to be among the first animals to have colonised land during the Silurian geologic period (443 million years ago). These early forms probably ate mosses and primitive vascular plants. The oldest known land creature, Pneumodesmus newmani, was a 1 centimetre long millipede.",
            "millipede conservation status": "No millipedes are considered endangered or threatened."

            "diet": "Most mongooses are predators and feed on a wide range of animals. These include small mammals and birds, reptiles, insects and crabs. Some species also eat tubers, fruits and berries, eggs and carrion.These animals are notable for their attacks on highly venomous snakes such as king cobras. They are successful hunters because they are fast and agile, and are able to crack a snake\u2019s skull with one bite. While they are bitten by the snakes occasionally, mongooses possess a glycoprotein that binds to proteins in snake venom, deactivating them and making them harmless. They have a keen sense of smell, sight and hearing which helps them with hunting these animals, too.Mongooses are also noted for the way in which they can open eggs and other food items with hard shells, such as crabs, mollusks, and nuts. They stand on their hind legs and hit the egg against the ground. They also carry the egg to a rock standing with their back to the rock, throws the egg between their legs and against the rock until the shell is broken.",

They mostly live alone or in pairs, but a few species, such as meerkats, live in large groups.They chatter incessantly to each other with a humane-like speech. They also sound alarm calls when they spot predators. During mating season, they produce high-pitched giggling sounds to inform potential partners they are ready to mate.",
            "reproduction": "Females mongooses usually produce just one litter each year, but are capable of producing another litter if the first litter is lost. Baby mongooses are called pups and a group of offspring is called a litter. Litters usually consist of two to four young.Pup mongooses are weaned at around 6 weeks old. They then forage with their mothers until they are about 4 months old. Male mongoose young leave their mothers when they are about 6 months old, but female mongoose young stay with their mother longer, sometimes permanently.Mongoose Location and HabitatMongooses are found mainly in Africa but also in southern Asia and southern Europe. They have a wide variety of habitats, ranging from desert to tropical forest. They usually make complex burrowing systems to live in.\u00a0Mongoose Conservation StatusUnfortunately, most mongoose species are threatened.

In 1978 a few breeding pairs were introduced in western Colorado and the states moose population is now more than 1,000 individuals. In Europe, moose are found in large numbers throughout northern european countries. Moose are also widespread through Russia. Small populations remain in Poland and Belarus. In 2008 moose were reintroduced in to the Scottish Highlands in the United Kingdom. There are five subspecies of moose: European moose (Alces alces alces) Northern Europe.

The reindeer and caribou are the only deer species in which both the male and female have antlers.The huge palmate antlers of a mature male moose measure between 1.2 metres (3.9 feet) and 1.5 metres (4.9 feet) wide. The smallest type of moose is the European moose (Alces alces alces), which weighs 350 kilograms (770 pounds) in males and 310 kilograms (683 pounds) in females. The male moose will drop its antlers after the mating season and conserve energy for the winter. Their antlers regrow in the spring. Antlers take 3 to 5 months to fully develop, making them one of the fastest growing animal organs. They initially have a layer of skin called \u2018felt\u2019 or \u2018velvet\u2019 which is shed once the antlers become fully grown.Young male moose may not shed their antlers for the winter, but retain them until the following spring. The first pair of antlers on a young moose grow from two tiny bumps on their head that are there from birth.

Moose eat leaves, twigs, buds and the bark of some woody plants, as well as lichens, aquatic plants and some of the taller herbaceous land plants. Moose can be seen eating during the day and night, but they are usually out at dawn and dusk. Moose can actually feed under water.",
            "behaviour": "Moose are mostly diurnal animals. They are generally solitary with the strongest bonds being between mother and calf. Two individuals can sometimes be found feeding along the same stream. The males are polygamous and will seek several females to breed with. Groups or herds are generally seen during breeding season and may only contain two adults. Each group, were possible, would occupy an area of 300 \u2013 600 hectares.A moose can run 35 miles per hour and can easily swim 10 miles. Moose will lie in shallow water to get away from biting insects or to cool off. Their tails are too short to swish the flies away. Moose are able to kick out in all directions, however, they generally use their front feet to defend themselves. Moose have poor eyesight and rely on their keen sense of smell. Often, while they are eating, moose will just suddenly stop and listen to see if they can hear any threats.You can tell when a moose might attack if the long hairs on its hump are raised and its ears are laid back. A moose may also lick its lips.Some populations of moose (particularly in Europe) migrate.",
            "reproduction": "Moose breeding season occurs in September and October. During this time both male and female moose will call to each other. Males produce heavy grunting sounds that can be heard from up to 500 metres away while females produce a wail-like sound. Males will fight for access to females. The larger moose generally wins and the smaller moose retreats. They may engage in battles that can turn quite violent.Female moose have an 8 month gestation period. Most litters consist of a single calf, however, twins are not uncommon. The young are unable to walk for a few days. By the time they are 2 weeks old they are able to walk about with their mother and search for food. By autumn, the calves stop suckling their mothers milk. The calves stay with the mother for about a year, until she is ready to give birth to new calves.A full-grown moose has few enemies, however, a pack of wolves can still be a threat, especially to females with calves. Moose will sometimes stand their ground and defend themselves by charging at the wolves or lashing out at them with their powerful hooves. The life span of a moose is around 15 \u2013 25 years.",

They resemble Chinese dragons with their colorful appearance and high dorsal fins. They\u2019re also suspected of being hermaphrodites that change from male to female as they age.Fangtooth moray eels (Enchelycore anatina) have jagged, glass-like teeth that protrude from their first set of jaws. They also have bright yellow heads with brown-and-yellow spotted bodies that give them the nickname tiger moray and birds-eye moray.Giant moray eels (Gymnothorax javanicus) are the largest morays by mass. They measure 9 to 10 feet long and weigh an average of 65 pounds.Laced moray eels (Gymnothorax favagineus) are also known as leopard morays or honeycomb morays because of the black spots on their white and tan bodies. These spots reflect the amount of camouflage in their environment, so if they live in an area with less coral, they\u2019ll also have fewer spots. They live in the Indo-Pacific Ocean region and are one of the eels living on the Great Barrier Reef.Golden-tail moray eels (Gymnothorax miliaris), also known as yellow canary morays, are popular among fish owners. They have a visually interesting appearance and are known to be quite active in their aquariums.Unicorn moray eels (Echidna unicolor) have ghostly white or tan bodies with dark rings at the tops of their heads.Mediterranean moray eels (Muraenina helena) are also sometimes known as the Roman moray. Its range includes the Mediterranean Sea and the eastern Atlantic Ocean.Zebra moray eels (Gymnomuraena zebra) have black and white stripes much like a zebra.Green moray eels (Gymnothorax funebris) are actually brown. It\u2019s the mucus covering their bodies that gives them a neon green or yellow appearance.Snowflake moray eels (Echidna nebulosa) are one of the few moray species that like to feed on mollusks, crustaceans and sea urchins. They have blunt teeth that are specifically designed for crushing through the hard shells of their prey. Other morays go for softer creatures or smaller ones that they can swallow whole.\u00a0"

The underside of the wings resembles foliage, with mottled brown, greys, blacks and reds. The female Morpho butterfly is less vivid than the male. The males bright coloring is designed to intimidate any rivals that might fly into his territory. The males wings reflect the bright, iridescent color over an extremely wide angle, to maximize its visibility in the rainforest.These colors are not a result of pigmentation but rather are an example of iridescence (an optical phenomenon characterized as the property of surfaces in which hue changes according to the angle from which the surface is viewed). The colors produced vary with viewing angle, however they are actually surprisingly uniform, perhaps due to the tetrahedral (diamond-like) structural arrangement of the scales. This structure may be called a \u2018photonic crystal\u2019.The ventral side is decorated with \u2018ocelli\u2019 or eyespots. Not all Morpho butterflies have iridescent coloration, however, they all have ocelli. The eyes of Morpho butterflies are thought to be highly sensitive to UV light and therefore the males are able to see each other from great distances.There also exists a number of white Morpho species. An unusual species that is white in coloration, but which exhibits a stunning purple iridescence when viewed at certain angles. The metallic blue Morpho species (M. rhetenor) stands out as the most iridescence of all.",

It uses its proboscis (long, protruding mouth part) to drink sap and fruit juices.Morpho butterflies taste with sensors on their legs and taste-smell the air with their antennae.Morpho butterflies feed on the juices of fermenting fruit with which they may also be lured. The inebriated butterflies wobble in flight and are easy to catch. Morphos will also feed on the bodily fluids of dead animals and on fungi. Therefore, Morpho butterflies may be important in dispersing fungal spores.",
            "behaviour": "Morpho butterflies are diurnally active (active during the day) and have the capability of \u2018crypis\u2019, meaning when they sleep at night, they fold their wings so that only the dark underside is seen, making them less visible to predators. It also has a \u2018flashing\u2019 defence mechanism, meaning, due to the slow beating pace of their wings, the iridescent blue is flashed and then disappears as the wings are raised only to return in another place in a short while. This causes predators to loose track of the Morpho butterfly when it is flying as they only glimpse blue flashes as the brown underside makes them invisible in the thick foliage of the jungle.",
            "reproduction": "Like all butterflies, Morpho butterflies pass through four distinct phases of metamorphosis.First, the pale green eggs that resemble dewdrops hatch into larvae, better known as caterpillars. The caterpillar is red-brown with bright patches of lime-green on its back and has stinging hairs. The hairy brown caterpillars feed on a variety of leguminous plants (a simple dry fruit which develops from a simple carpel and usually opens along a seam on two sides). In some species the caterpillars are cannibalistic. If disturbed, some Morpho caterpillars will secrete a fluid smelling of rancid butter. The tufts of hair decorating the caterpillars have been recorded to irritate human skin.After a while, the caterpillars wrap themselves in a protective enclosure, called a chrysalis. At this stage the insects are called pupae. After some time, pupation ends and the mature butterfly emerges from its chrysalis.The entire life cycle of the Morpho butterfly, from egg to death, is approximately 137 days. The adults live for about a month. They have few predators as the adults are poisonous due to the feeding caterpillar sequestering poisonous compounds (the process of animals accumulating poisonous compounds from the food they are eating in order to become poisonous themselves for their predators). But like all butterflies, adult morphos were plant-chomping caterpillars as youngsters. Blue morpho caterpillars are especially fond of leaves in the pea family.",
            "conservation status": "Not listed by the IUCN.",
            "": "The Morpho butterfly has intrigued man for generations with its optical engineering. Today, its dazzling iridescent wings are giving rise to a market to try to mimic its wonder and create a counterfeit proof currency and charge cards. This butterfly may become world famous as its power with light changes the face of money."

            "desc": " Moths are insect closely related to butterflies. Both belong to the order Lepidoptera. The differences between butterflies and moths is more than just taxonomy. Scientists have identified some 200,000 species of moths world wide and suspect there may be as many as five times that amount. Moths often have feather like antennae with no club at the end. When perched, their wings lay flat. Moths tend to have thick hairy bodies and more earth tone colored wings. Moths are usually active at night and rest during the day in a preferred wooded habitat.",
            "description": "Moths often have feather like antennae with no club at the end. When perched, their wings lay flat. Moths tend to have thick hairy bodies and more earth tone colored wings. Moths are usually active at night and rest during the day in a preferred wooded habitat.Moths have very long proboscis, or tongues, which they use to suck nectar or other fluids. These proboscis are very tightly coiled not in use, like a hosepipe. When in use, the proboscis are uncoiled to their full length and in some species, that length is remarkably long. The Hummingbird Moth has a tongue that is actually longer than its whole body. The Darwin\u2019s Hawk moth of Madagascar has a proboscis nearly 13 inches long, evolved, no doubt, to enable feeding on deep throated orchids which grow in that region.Not all Moths have long tongues. In some, the proboscis is very short, an adaptation which enables easy and effective piercing of fruit.In some, there is no feeding mechanism at all. There are adults of some species that do not take in any food. Their brief lives as an adult are spent reproducing and they are able to acquire all of the energy needed for this from the fat stored in the body by the caterpillar.A moths antennae, palps, legs and many other parts of the body are studded with sense receptors that are used to smell. The sense of smell is used for finding food (usually flower nectar) and for finding mates (the female smelling the males pheromones). Pheromones can be dispersed through the tibia segment of the leg, scales on the wings or from the abdomen. Pheromones released by females can be detected by the males from as much as 8 kilometres away.",
            "camouflage": "Camouflage is a great defence in avoiding detection by a hungry predator. Some moths look just like lichen, others look exactly like the bark of trees native to their habitat. It has even been noticed that in city areas where smoke pollution is strong, some moths have actually developed a darker coloration than the same species that live in less polluted areas.Another effective form of camouflage is coloration which can confuse a predator into either striking at a none vital part of the moths body or into missing it all together. The lines and spots on these moths would make aiming in on it difficult, especially when it is moving.Another form of defence is where the moth takes on the appearance of a larger/or more threatening creature. This amazing ability is called \u2018mimicry\u2019. This form of defence ranges from caterpillars with tails that look like a large venomous snakes head, to moths and butterflies whose markings make them appear to be large birds.",
            "vision": "Moths (like many other adult insects) have compound eyes and simple eyes. These eyes are made up of many hexagonal lens/corneas which focus light from each part of the insects field of view onto a rhabdome (the equivalent of our retina). An optic nerve then carries this information to the insects brain. They see very differently from us. they can see ultraviolet rays (which are invisible to us).The vision of Moths changes radically in their different stages of life.Moth caterpillars can barely see at all. They have simple eyes (ocelli) which can only differentiate dark from light. They cannot form an image. They are composed of photoreceptors (light-sensitive cells) and pigments. Most caterpillars have a semi-circular ring of six ocelli on each side of the head.",
            "senses": "A caterpillars \u2018fuzz\u2019 gives it its sense of touch. Caterpillars sense touch using long hairs (called tactile setae) that grow through holes all over their hard exoskeleton. These hairs are attached to nerve cells and relay information about the touch to the insects brain.Setae (sensory hairs) on the insects entire body (including the antennae) can feel the environment. They also give the insect information about the wind while it is flying.",
            "navigation": "Moths navigate by two methods. They use the moon and stars when available and geomagnetic clues when light sources are obscured.",
            "behaviour": "Moths heat up their flight muscles by vibrating their wings, since they do not have the radiant energy of the sun (being nocturnal) at their disposal to serve that purpose.",
            "s": "Night-blooming flowers usually depend on moths (or bats) for pollination, and artificial lighting can draw moths away from the flowers, affecting the plants ability to reproduce. A way to prevent this is to put a cloth or netting around the lamp. Another way is using a colored light bulb (preferably red). This will take the moths attention away from the light while still providing light to see by.Despite being framed for eating clothing, most moth adults do not eat at all. Most like the Luna, Polyphemus, Atlas, Prometheus, Cercropia and other large moths do not have mouths. When they do eat, moths will drink nectar. Only one species of moth eat wool. The adults do not eat but the larvae will eat through wool clothing.The study of Moths (and Butterflies) is known as \u2018lepidoptery\u2019, and biologists that specialise in either are called \u2018lepidopterists\u2019. As a pastime, watching Moths (and Butterflies) is known as \u2018mothing\u2019 and \u2018butterflying\u2019.Moths, and particularly their caterpillars, are a major agricultural pest in many parts of the world. The caterpillar of the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) causes severe damage to forests in the northeast United States, where it is an invasive species. In temperate climates, the codling moth causes extensive damage, especially to fruit farms. In tropical and subtropical climates, the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) is perhaps the most serious pest of brassicaceous crops (the mustard family or cabbage family).Butterflies and moths hear sounds through their wings.Thousands of tiny scales and hairs cover moths wings, not powder.Butterflies and moths both have an organ called the Johnston\u2019s organ which is at the base of a butterfly or moths antennae. This organ are responsible for maintaining the butterflys sense of balance and orientation, especially during flight.A Cecropia moth has the ability to smell his mate up to 7 miles away with his feathery antennae.The Sphinx Hawk moth is the fastest moth in the world, capable of reaching speeds over 30 miles per hour."

The Mountain Goat resides at high elevations and is a sure-footed climber, often resting on rocky cliffs that predators cannot reach. The Mountain Goat belongs to the subfamily Caprinae, along with 32 other species including true goats, sheep, the chamois and the musk ox.",
            "description": "Mountain Goats stand around 3 feet 3 inches at the shoulder. Both male (billy) and female (nanny) have beards, short tails and long black horns, however, the males horns and beard are longer than the females. Horns can grow to measure 15 \u2013 28 centimetres and have yearly growth rings. Mountain goats typically weigh between 45 and 136 kilograms (100 \u2013 300 pounds) and females are usually 10 \u2013 30% lighter than males.Mountain Goats have double coats to protect them from the cold. Their undercoats are fine dense wool which are covered by an outer coat of longer, hollow hairs. In warmer summer months, mountain goats rub against rocks and trees to help molting. Their coats help them to withstand temperatures as low as -50 Fahrenheit and winds of up to 100 miles per hour.Mountain Goats feet are well adapted for climbing steep, rocky slopes with cloven hooves that spread apart as required. They have dew claws on the back of their feet that help them from slipping.",
            "habitat": "Mountain goats inhabit rocky terrain in alpine and sub alpine regions. Mountain goats frequent extremely steep slopes with pitches above 60 degrees. Mountain goats seasonally migrate from higher rockslide slopes and alpine meadows in the spring and summer to lower elevations in the winter, however, they usually remain above the timberline in winter.",
            "diet": "Although they have gained notoriety for their shows of aggression, mountain goats spend most of their time quietly grazing. Their diet includes grasses, herbs, sedges, ferns, moss, lichen, twigs and leaves from the low-growing shrubs and conifers of their high-altitude habitat.Learn more about Goat Anatomy and the Goat Stomach",
            "behaviour": "Although mountain goats sometimes descend to sea level in coastal areas, they are primarily an alpine and sub alpine species. Throughout the year, the animals usually stay above the snow line, however, they do migrate seasonally to higher or lower altitudes within that range. Summertime migrations to low altitude mineral licks often take them several or more kilometres through forested areas.",
            "reproduction": "In terms of mountain goat reproduction, breeding season occurs late May to early June. Mountain goats reach sexual maturity at about 30 months. The gestation period for the female mountain goat (nanny) is around 6 months. Nannies move to an isolated edge and usually give birth to a single young (kid). Kids weigh around 3 kilograms (7 pounds) at birth. Within hours of being born, the kid attempts to run and climb. Kids are weaned within 1 month and continue to follow their mother around for their first year.After the breeding season is over, males and females move away from each other, with the adult billies breaking up into small bands of two or three individuals. Nannies form loose-knit nursery groups of up to 50 animals.Female mountain goats use their fighting abilities to protect themselves and their offspring from predators, such as wolves, wolverines, cougars, lynx and bears. Even at higher higher altitudes, nannies still must defend their young from golden eagles, which can be a threat to very young kids.",

Mountain Gorillas have longer and darker hair than other gorillas, enabling them to live at high altitudes and travel into areas where temperatures drop below freezing. Mountain Gorillas have adapted to a life on the ground more than any other non-human primate and their feet most resemble those of humans. ",
            "mountain gorilla characteristics": "Mountain Gorillas can be identified by nose prints unique to each individual, just like other gorillas. Mountain Gorillas have long, silky black coats, a large body with hairless face, palms, soles and chest. Of the five sub-species of gorilla, the mountain gorilla is one of the rarest. Remarkably strong, the mountain gorilla has a short trunk and a broad chest and shoulders.",
            "mountain gorilla family structure": "Mountain Gorillas are highly social and live in relatively stable, cohesive groups held together by long-term bonds between adult male mountain gorillas and female mountain gorillas. A typical Mountain Gorilla group is led by the biggest and strongest mature male gorilla. The mature male gorilla is called a \u2018silverback\u2019 because the hair on a males back turns from black to silvery grey as he matures. A silverbacks group normally includes a sub-adult male gorilla or two and a few female gorillas and their young.",
            "mountain gorilla reproduction": "Mountain Gorilla males mature later than females and do not breed until they reach 15 to 20 years of age. About half of all male gorillas leave their natal groups at puberty and travel alone or with other subordinate male gorillas until they establish their own group. Once a male gorilla has established a group, he will most likely stay with that group for life unless he is ousted by another male gorilla. Fights for access to females among dominant silverbacks and lone males are intense and may result in death.Adult female gorillas give birth to one baby about every 4 years although a surviving infant is produced only every 6 to 8 years due to high infant mortality in the first three years of life. A baby gorilla is born weighing 1.8 \u2013 2 kilograms (4 \u2013 4.4 pounds) after a gestation period of 251 \u2013 295 days. Baby gorillas are carried around by their mothers and begin to walk after 30 \u2013 40 weeks. Gorilla infants are breast feed for about 12 months. Infant gorillas normally stay with their mother for 3 to 4 years and mature at around 11 to 12 years old. Gorilla infants are weaned at 2.5 to 3 years of age.Young male and female gorillas are classed as juvenile between the ages of about 3 and 6. During this stage, both male and female gorillas have thick black hair and black skin. Juveniles of both male and female gorillas increase in size and weight at similar rates for the first six years. At age six they are about 1.2 metres (4 feet) tall and weigh about 68 kilograms (150 pounds).",
            "mountain gorilla life cycle": "Mountain gorillas have a slow rate of reproduction. This slow reproduction makes this species even more threatened. During a 40 \u2013 50 year life span, a female Mountain Gorilla might have only 2 \u2013 6 living offspring. Female mountain gorillas give birth for the first time at about the age of 10 years old and will have offspring every four years or more.Female Mountain gorillas mature at about age 6 and cease to grow taller, although they continue to gain weight slowly until they reach weights of 113 \u2013 136 kilograms (250 \u2013 300 pounds) at ages of 10 to 11 years. Male Mountain gorillas continue to grow both in size and weight past the age of 6 years old. They do not reach maturity until they are about 12 years old. Between the ages of about 6 and 10 years, males retain the uniformly black hair color of their youth and are called \u2018Blackbacks\u2019.The potential for population growth for undisturbed mountain gorillas is comparable to that for human beings. The gestation period is about 9 months. Gorilla mothers with an infant may not have another for up to 4 years. There is also no apparent breeding season, since births of baby gorillas occur throughout the year. However, due to mishaps and disease, many baby gorillas die in the first year of life and nearly half of all gorillas die before reaching adulthood.The maximum life span of mountain gorillas in the wild is difficult to estimate. The longest-lived gorillas in captivity reached ages of 30 to 35 years. No gorilla has been seen in the wild that looked as aged as the oldest captive gorillas, so the life span in the wild is probably somewhat less, perhaps 25 to 30 years. There are no known mountain gorillas in captivity at present.",
            "mountain gorilla behaviour": "The Mountain Gorilla is a highly intelligent and gentle creature. Despite a ferocious reputation, the Mountain Gorilla rarely makes use of his incredible strength. When it comes to defending the family or breeding rights, however, it does display dominance.Mountain gorillas wander around a home range of up to 15 square miles (39 square kilometres). Mountain Gorilla spend much of their time eating. Their food includes a variety of plants, along with a few insects and worms. At night, Mountain Gorillas make a nest to sleep in. Many lightweight gorillas nest in trees, making beds of bent branches. The heavier individuals may nest in grasses on the ground. Mountain Gorilla infants snuggle with their mothers for the night.For a long time the image most people had of a gorilla encounter included chest pounding, roaring, charging and big, bared teeth. However, researchers studying gorillas reveal a very different picture of mountain gorillas. Mountain Gorillas are peaceful, gentle, social and mainly vegetarian creatures. The occasional ferocious-looking, impressive displays are generally from a male gorilla protecting his family group from a threat. Gorillas, especially males, have a wide range of vocal and physical communications. Silverbacks can roar, scream and bark to deter predators or competitors. Mountain Gorillas stand on their legs and beat their large chests, which contain air sacks, to produce an intimidating thudding sound. Mountain Gorillas may even charge at people or gorillas they see as threatening, striking the ground with their fists in a display of aggression.",
            "mountain gorilla diet": "Mountain gorillas eat large amounts of vegetation and spend about 30 percent of each day foraging for food. Mountain Gorillas consume roots, leaves, stems of herbs, vines, bark from trees, shrub-sized plants and bamboo shoots.",
            "mountain gorilla conservation status": "Life for Mountain gorillas is not all that peaceful. Mountain Gorillas are endangered, threatened by civil war in a small area of Africa where they live. Hunters kill them for food or trophies. Mountain Gorillas forests are chopped down for farmland, fuel and housing. However, many dedicated scientists, park rangers and other concerned people are working hard to protect mountain gorillas, their forests and their way of life in the mountains.Today, about 320 mountain gorillas inhabit the Virungas, however, their long term survival continues to be threatened by natural changes and disasters, hunters and poachers and the chronic political instability that swirls around the edge of their forest home."

The male Eastern mouse spider (Missulena bradleyi) have a bluish patch and the male Red-headed mouse spider (Missulena occatoria) are brownish in color, with red-tinged jaws.",
            "habitat and spider webs": "Mouse spiders are part of the Gondwanaland fauna (southern super continent) this is because most are residents of Australia, although one species is found in Chile and another near relative is found in South America.Mouse spiders live in burrows in soil covered with a hinged top known as the trapdoor. Mouse spider burrows can extend to the depth of 30 centimetres (12 inches). The burrow provides a refuge from predators, parasites, low humidity and high temperatures. Male Mouse spiders will often wander from the burrow in search of mates, however, the females will remain inside the burrows spending most of her life in there unless accidentally dug up.",
            "diet": "Mouse spiders prey mainly on insects though they may consume other small animals as opportunity presents. Mouse spiders feed by lunging at prey passing the burrow entrance. The primary predators of the mouse spider include wasps, bandicoots, centipedes and scorpions.",
            "venom": "Both male and female Mouse spiders have very large fangs and fang bases. Mouse spiders are aggressive spiders and will bite if provoked. However, only several of the species have been found to produce serious symptoms similar to those by the Funnel Web spider. Unlike the funnel-web, however, the mouse spider is far less aggressive towards humans (unless provoked) and may often give \u2018dry\u2019 bites.",
            "reproduction": "Males reach sexual maturity at about 4 years. Mouse spiders leave their shallow burrows during the breeding season to find a mate. They are unusual in that their wandering behaviour occurs during the day, unlike other mygalomorph spiders, whose males are night wanderers. Mating usually takes place within the females burrow. The female Mouse spider lays 60 or more eggs within an egg sac that she places into a brood chamber off the main shaft of her burrow. The spiderlings hatch from the egg sac over summer and remain with the mother into autumn when dispersal occurs.The spiderlings of the Red-headed Mouse Spider disperse by ballooning, a technique that is rare in mygalomorphs. This explains the relatively wide distribution of Red-headed Mouse Spiders compared to other mygalomorph species, including the Eastern Mouse Spider, which probably disperses on the ground."

            "desc": "Solitary wasps differ from the Social wasps in nesting habits and life cycle. As they do not have any workers, the queens care for their own young, therefore they usually only have a single nest. Solitary wasp queens use their ability to sting and paralyze prey such as flies, caterpillars and spiders. As a result of this, Solitary wasps are not aggressive and rarely sting humans \u2013 they will only sting if touched or caught in clothing.  The Mud Dauber wasps are medium to large sized and are either shiny black or metallic blue-black with slender abdomens. They get their name from building their nests out of mud. Mud Dauber wasps build finger-like nests of mud which are attached to flat or vertical surfaces. The mud is molded into cells by the wasps mandibles. Their nests are usually built in sheds, barns and other structures. In each mud cell, the queen Mud Dauber wasp will lay one egg and put in a paralyzed spider or other insect and seal the cell.",

The larvae matures in about 3 weeks. The larvae will then spin a cocoon to rest in over winter.Male Mud Dauber wasps guard the cocoons while the females forage for more food. Pupation occurs while the larvae is inside the cocoon.When the wasp is ready to leave the cocoon inside the cell, a female will moisten the clay and clear out any left-over spiders from the cell. She will then lay her own egg and seal it over for metamorphosis to repeat itself.Mud Dauber wasps are mainly found in the US, I think they are rather rare in the British Isles."

They can be found on the treeless tundra from Alaska east through northern Canada to Greenland. Their name is derived from the strong musky smell of the bulls that is omitted during the mating season in summer. The musky smell is used to attract females during breeding. There are 2 known subspecies of Musk Ox, Greenland Musk ox (Ovibos moschatus wardi) also known as the White-Faced Musk ox which are found in Greenland and the Canadian high Arctic and the Barren Ground Musk ox (Ovibos moschatus moschatus) which are found on the Canadian mainland. Musk Ox are more closely related to sheep and goats than to oxen. The closest relative of the Musk ox is the Takin, a goat-antelope found in the Eastern Himalayas. ",
            "description": "The Musk Ox is a huge hoofed mammal with a heavy bony plate across the forehead. The Musk Ox, along with Yaks of Central Asia, have the longest fur of any other animal. They have an insulated woolly undercoat and some of the hairs in the outer coat are almost 100 centimetres long. Their coats are thick and dark brown hair in color and hang almost to the ground.Musk Oxen have a stocky build and a pronounced shoulder hump. These bulky animals can stay in the Arctic all year round, surviving temperatures of -70 degrees centigrade. With its long, shaggy outer coat, the Musk Ox is well protected from the bitterly cold winds of the Arctic Tundra.Adult Musk Ox measure around 1.9 \u2013 2.3 metres (6.25 \u2013 7.5 feet) in length from head to rump and weigh 200 \u2013 410 kilograms (440 \u2013 900 pounds). Musk Ox stand around 1.2 metres (3 feet 11.2 inches) high at the shoulder. Males are larger than females. Their huge size means they have very few natural predators. However, young Musk Ox are vulnerable to predators especially when newborn. Both male and female Musk Ox have broad, curling horns.",
            "habitat": "During the summer, Musk Oxen live in wetlands, such as river valleys, moving to higher elevations in the winter to avoid the deep snow.",
            "diet": "Musk Ox are herbivores and graze on grasses, reeds, sedges and other ground plants, digging through snow in the winter to reach their food. One of their favourite foods is willow.",
            "behaviour": "Musk Oxen live in herds of around 10 -20 animals and are social animals. Winter herds can contain over 70 animals of both male and female.Young Musk Ox are often taken by Grey Wolves, however, if the herd spots a wolf pack soon enough, it has a chance to deploy an effective defensive strategy. Adults quickly gather into a circle of tightly packed animals, all facing outwards, with the young hidden away in the middle. The hunting wolves meet a wall of tough heads and horns and large bulls will charge out of the ring, swiping their horns at their attackers. The defence is only broken if the wolves manage to get the Oxen on the run. Other predators of the Musk Ox are the Brown Grizzly Bear and the Polar Bear.",
            "reproduction": "Mating season peaks in mid August when males compete for dominance. One dominant bull will drive the other males out of the herd. Non-breeding males will often for herds of 5 \u2013 10 and wander the tundra alone. Males can get extremely aggressive during breeding season and chase off any other animal that approaches, even birds. To prove their dominance, males have confrontations known as ruts. During these ruts, males emit a lion-like roar and run towards each other, crashing their heads together.Females are sexually mature at 2 years of age. Males reach maturity much later at around 5 years. The gestation period is 8 \u2013 9 months and almost all births are single calves. The young are nursed for around a year but may begin to eat grass as soon as a week after birth. The young huddle in its mothers long coat to keep warm.The life span of a Musk Ox is around 20 \u2013 24 years.",
            "conservation status": "The conservation status of the Musk Ox is \u2018Least Concern\u2019. Muskoxen became extinct across much of their range in Europe and Alaska, largely as a result of overhunting. Reintroduction attempts have since been reasonably successful and muskoxen now live once again in parts of Alaska and northern Europe. They are not currently listed as threatened in any way."

Female Natterjack Toads are larger than male Natterjack Toads. Natterjack Toads are distinguished from the common toad by a yellow line down the middle of the back. Natterjack Toads have relatively long legs, and this gives them a distinctive gait, contrasting with the hopping movement of many other toad species. Natterjacks have a very loud and distinctive mating call, amplified by the single vocal sack found under the chin of the male animal."

The primary means of defence for these spiders are urticating hairs, which can cause irritation and other typical symptoms in humans. Urticating hairs are one of the primary defence mechanisms used by some tarantulas and lepidopteran caterpillars. Urticating hairs are barbed hairs that cover the dorsal and posterior surface of the Tarantulas abdomen. Many Tarantula species will frequently kick the urticating hairs off their abdomens, directing them towards potential attackers. These hairs can embed themselves in the other animals skin or eyes and cause physical irritation.",
            "new world tarantula spider characteristics": "New World Tarantula species vary in size from several small species, which may only have a leg span of 7.5 centimetres (3 inches) to other species which may attain leg spans of 17.5 centimetres (7 inches) or slightly larger as in the Goliath Birdeater tarantula (12 inches).Most species will average in size from 10 centimetres (4 inches) to 12.5 centimetres (5 inches) in leg span and are less robust in body size thanMost are colorful or patterned and many are colored in bright metallic hues of bronze, pink, green, blue, purple or gold on the carapace, trochanters and femurs of the legs.Most New World Tarantulas are covered in both short and long setae (stiff hair, bristle, or bristle-like process or part of an organism). Some species are densely covered in short, silky setae.The setae covering the legs of many species give some Tarantulas a sculpted, streamlined appearance in comparison to others which typically appear more robust and \u2018shaggy\u2019 in appearance.

            "new world tarantula spider habitat and webs": "New world tarantula spiders are found in tropical and desert regions around the world. New world tarantula spiders do not spin webs unless they live in a tunnel. These spiders line their tunnel with web to catch wandering prey.\u00a0",
            "new world tarantula spider diet": "New world tarantula spiders mainly eat insects and other arthropods, caught by speed or ambush. The biggest animals a Tarantula can kill are as large as lizards, mice or birds.The tarantulas mouth is located under its chelicerae on the lower front part of its prosoma. The mouth is a short straw-shaped opening which can only suck, meaning that anything taken into it must be in liquid form.Prey with large amounts of solid parts such as mice must be crushed and ground up or predigested, which is accomplished by spraying the prey with digestive juices that are excreted from openings in the chelicerae.The tarantulas digestive organ (stomach) is a tube that runs the length of its body. In the prosoma, this tube is wider and forms the sucking stomach. When the sucking stomachs powerful muscles contract, the stomach is increased in cross-section, creating a strong sucking action that permits the tarantula to suck its liquidized prey up through the mouth and into the intestines.Once the liquidized food enters the intestines, it is broken down into particles small enough to pass through the intestine walls into the haemolymph (blood stream) where it is distributed throughout the body.\u00a0",
            "new world tarantula spider venom": "Individuals that have reported rare bites from New World Tarantula species have indicated nothing more than the initial pain caused by the mechanical action of the bite itself and minor local effects such as redness and swelling at the site of the bite.\u00a0",
            "new world tarantula spider reproduction": "Once a male spider reaches maturity and becomes motivated to mate, it will weave a web mat on a flat surface. The spider will then rub its abdomen on the surface of this mat and in so doing release a quantity of semen. It may then insert its pedipalps (short leg-like appendages between the chelicerae and front legs) into the pool of semen.The pedipalps absorb the semen and keep it viable until a mate can be found. When a male spider detects the presence of a female, the two exchange signals to establish that they are of the same species.These signals may also lure the female into a receptive state. If the female is receptive then the male approaches her and inserts his pedipalps into an opening in the lower surface of her abdomen.After the semen has been transferred to the receptive females body, the male will generally quickly leave the scene before the female recovers her appetite. Although females may show some aggression after mating, the male rarely becomes a meal.Females deposit 50 to 2000 eggs, depending on the species, in a silken egg sac and guard it for 6 to 7 weeks. The young spiderlings remain in the nest for some time after hatching where they live off the remains of their yolk sac before dispersing.Tarantulas usually live in solitude and being cannibalistic, will attack and eat others of their own kind."

Hidden under submerged ledges or in crevices within the reef, the Nurse sharks seem to prefer specific resting sites and will return to them each day after the nights hunting. By night, the sharks are largely solitary. Nurse sharks spend most of their time foraging through the bottom sediments in search of food. Their diet consists primarily of crustaceans, molluscs, tunicates and other fish such as spiny lobsters, crabs, shrimps, sea urchins, octopuses, squid, marine snails and bivalves and in particularly, stingrays.Nurse sharks are thought to take advantage of dormant fish which would otherwise be too fast for the sharks to catch, although their small mouths limit the size of prey items, the sharks have large throat cavities which are used as a sort of bellows valve. In this way, Nurse sharks are able to suck in their prey. Nurse sharks are also known to graze algae and coral.",
            "reproduction": "The mating season runs from late June to the end of July. Nurse sharks are ovoviviparous, meaning the eggs develop and hatch within the body of the female where the hatchlings develop further until live birth occurs. The gestation period is 6 months, with a typical litter of 21 \u2013 28 pups. The mating cycle is biennial, as it takes 18 months for the females ovaries to produce another batch of eggs. The young Nurse sharks are born fully developed at about 30 centimetres long. They possess a spotted coloration which fades with age.",
            "behaviour": "Generally slow and sluggish, Nurse sharks spend much of their time resting on the bottom of the ocean. Nurse sharks have been observed resting on the bottom with their bodies supported on their fins, possibly providing a false shelter for crustaceans which they then ambush and eat. If it must move, the Nurse shark may even use its large front (or pectoral) fins to \u2018walk\u2019 along the ocean floor.Because the Nurse shark can pump water over its gills, it does not need to swim in order to breathe, like other sharks do.Unlike many sharks, the Nurse shark is non-migratory. The Nurse shark adapts to cold by becoming even less active.",
            "conservation": "The Nurse shark is not widely commercially fished, but because of its sluggish behaviour it is an easy target for local fisheries. Its skin is exceptionally tough and is prized for leather. Its flesh is consumed fresh and salted and its liver utilised for oil. It is not taken as a game fish. It has been reported in some unprovoked attacks on humans but is not generally perceived as a threat.Nurse sharks are common throughout their range but are still considered \u2018Near Threatened\u2019.No species is known to regularly prey on Nurse sharks, although they have been found in the stomach contents of lemon sharks, tiger sharks, bull sharks and great hammerhead sharks."

            "reproduction": "When mating, the female will find a den in a cave in a rocky bluff, a hollow tree, or a dense (preferably thorny) thicket. Mating is non-seasonal. The gestation period is estimated to be 70 days. Generally the female will have 2 \u2013 4 kittens, born in the autumn with their eyes closed and a thin covering of hair. The life span of the Ocelot is around 8 \u2013 11 years.",
            "conservation status": "The ocelots fur resembles that of a Jaguar and was once regarded as particularly valuable. As a result, hundreds of thousands of Ocelots have been killed for their fur. The Ocelot was classified a \u2018vulnerable\u2019 endangered species from the 1980s until 1996, but is now generally considered \u2018least concern\u2019 by the 2006 IUCN Red List.",
            "subspecies": "The following are the currently recognized subspecies:Leopardus pardalis pardalis, Amazon Rainforest Leopardus pardalis aequatorialis, northern Andes and Central America Leopardus pardalis albescens, Mexico, southwestern Texas Leopardus pardalis melanurus, Venezuela, Guyana, Trinidad, Barbados, Grenada Leopardus pardalis mitis, Argentina, Paraguay Leopardus pardalis nelsoni, Mexico Leopardus pardalis pseudopardalis, Colombia Leopardus pardalis puseaus, Ecuador Leopardus pardalis sonoriensis, Mexico Leopardus pardalis steinbachi, Bolivia\u00a0The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped animals and often depicted ocelots in their art.Like many wild cats, it is occasionally kept as a pet.

            "desc": "The Okapi (Okapia johnstoni) is a mammal located in the Ituri Rainforest in the north east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in central Africa. Although it has striped markings similar to those of the zebra, it is more closely related to the giraffe. Native just to the Ituri rainforests, it was known only to the local people until 1901.",
            "characteristics": "Okapis are 1.9 to 2.5 metres (8.1 feet) long and stand 1.5 to 2.0 metres (6.5 feet) high at the shoulder. Okapis tails measure 30 to 42 centimetre (12 to 17 inches) long. Their weight ranges from 200 to 250 kilograms (465 to 550 pounds).The Okapis velvet-like coat is generally dark chestnut-brown or purplish red in color, with distinctive pattern of horizontal stripes, much like those of a zebra, on the upper legs. These markings are thought to help young follow their mothers through the dense rainforest.The stripes also help the Okapi to camouflage away from predators. Their lower legs are white, with dark garters at the joints. The vaguely horse-like head is generally lighter, with a black muzzle and is supported by a thick neck.Okapis have large ears, which help them detect predators, mainly the leopard. Their black/blue tongue is long and prehensile. Both Okapis and Giraffes have very long, flexible tongues measuring around 30 centimetres (12 inches) long.They both use their tongues to strip leaves and buds from trees. The tongue of an okapi is long enough for the animal to wash its eyelids and clean its ears. It is one of the few mammals that can lick its own ears. Their body is sloped, with the forequarters much higher than the rear. Male okapis have short, skin-covered horns called \u2018ossicones\u2019 on their forehead which develop between one and five years of age.\u00a0",
            "diet": "Okapis eat tree leaves and buds, grass, ferns, fruit and fungi. Many of the plant species fed upon by the okapi are known to be poisonous to humans.Examination of okapi faeces has revealed that the charcoal from trees burnt by lightning is consumed as well. Field observations indicate that the okapis mineral and salt requirements are filled primarily by a sulphurous, slightly salty, reddish clay found near rivers and streams.\u00a0",
            "habitat": "Okapis live in the clearings and forest areas of the rainforest that are not dense with foliage. Okapis forage along fixed, well-trodden paths through the forest. They live alone or in mother-offspring pairs. Okapis have overlapping home ranges of several square kilometres.The home ranges of males are generally slightly larger than those of females. Okapis are not social animals and prefer to live in large, secluded areas. This has led to problems with the Okapi population due to the shrinking size of the land they live on.This lack of territory is caused by development and other social reasons. However, Okapis tolerate each other in the wild and may even feed in small groups for short periods of time.Okapis prefer altitudes of 500 to 1,000 metres, but may venture above 1,000 metres in the eastern montane rainforests. The range of the Okapi is limited by high montane forests to the east, swamp forests below 500 metres to the west, savannas of the Sahel/Sudan to the north and open woodlands to the south. Okapis are most common in the Wamba and Epulu areas.\u00a0",
            "behaviour": "Okapis are largely diurnal (active during the day) and essentially solitary, coming together only to breed. Okapis have several methods of communicating their territory, including scent glands on each foot that leave behind a tar-like substance which signals their passage, as well as urine marking. Males are protective of their territory, but allow females to pass through their domain to forage.\u00a0",
            "reproduction": "Okapi have a reproduction period of approximately 14 -15 months and give birth to a single infant. Young Okapis are born from August to October. Expectant mothers retreat into dense forest to give birth, after which the newborn lies hidden for several days. The young do not seem to bond on their mothers and have been observed nursing from two different females.\u00a0",
            "conservation status": "Although Okapis are not classified as endangered, they are threatened by habitat destruction and poaching. The world population is estimated at 10,000 \u2013 20,000. Conservation work in the Congo includes the continuing study of okapi behaviour and life styles, which led to the creation in 1992 of the Okapi Wildlife Reserve. The Congo Civil War threatened both the wildlife and the conservation workers in the Reserve.There is an important captive breeding centre at Epulu, at the heart of the reserve, which is managed jointly by the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation (ICCN) and Gillman International Conservation (GIC), who in turn receive support from other organisations including UNESCO, the Frankfurt Zoological Society and Wildlife Direct as well as from zoos around the world. The Wildlife Conservation Society is also active in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve.\u00a0",
            "history": "The okapi was known to the ancient Egyptians. Shortly after its discovery by Europeans, an ancient carved image of the animal was discovered in Egypt. For years, Europeans in Africa had heard of an animal that they came to call \u2018the African unicorn\u2019.In his travelogue of exploring the Congo, Henry Morton Stanley mentioned a kind of donkey that the natives called the \u2018atti\u2019, which scholars later identified as the okapi. Explorers may have seen the fleeting view of the striped backside as the animal fled through the bushes, leading to speculation that the okapi was some sort of rainforest zebra.Okapi are now reasonably common in zoos around North America and Europe. Immediately following their discovery, zoos around the world attempted to obtain Okapis from the wild. These initial attempts were accompanied by a high mortality rate due to the rigours of traveling thousands of miles by boat and by train. In more recent years, shipment by airplane has proven more successful."

It is also known as the \u2018Mombasa golden starburst tarantula\u2019.This species of spider is very aggressive and should not be held. The female Baboon spider can grow to 4 \u2013 6 inches in body length, while males typically range from 3 \u2013 4 inches. The spiders abdomen, carapace and legs have the same basic coloration, though the legs typically have brightly colored rings. The carapace has a star-shaped pattern, with a fishbone pattern present on the abdomen. The eyes are clustered together on a raised part of the carapace (in common with all tarantulas).

The Chinese bird spider is a fairly large spider, with a typical leg span of up to 8 inches (20 centimetres).The Chinese Bird Spider can be found in the tropical rain forests of southern China and Vietnam, where it builds and lives in burrows up to several feet deep, emerging to capture food. The Chinese Bird Spider preys on numerous small insects and other creatures, such as cockroaches, crickets and mice.The Chinese Bird Spider is an aggressive species, one that will not hesitate to bite humans if disturbed. Its venom is the subject of much toxicology research and while the effects of this spiders bite to humans is not well-documented, it is lethal in small doses to animals such as mice and rats. As a result, it is generally regarded as a highly venomous specimen. The venom itself is a rather complex neurotoxin, containing numerous compounds capable of blocking neurotransmitters.",

As a result, it should only be kept as a pet by experienced and well-informed tarantula enthusiasts.The Cobalt Blue Spider is also an obligate burrower and generally very shy. As with all Old World spiders they do not possess urticating hairs, so rely more on biting for defence.While popular as pets for its brilliant blue coloring, one must remember that these tarantulas must be treated as living art and never handled. Cobalt Blue Spiders are extremely aggressive and possess a painful bite."

Water Opossums have waterproof coats which have a grey and black pattern. Their hind feet are webbed and both male and female have pouches. The female can close her pouch using a ring of muscles to keep her young dry while she is under the water. The males pouch is always open and he uses it to protect his scrotum while in the water or when he is moving quickly through the forests.Most Opossums have long snouts and a prominent sagittal crest. Opossums also have more teeth than any other land mammal with very small incisors, large canines and tricuspid molars (having three cusps or points).

            "orb weaver spider habitat and webs": "Orb-weaving spiders are three-clawed builders of flat webs with sticky spiral capture silk. The building of a web is an engineering feat, begun when the spider floats a line on the wind to another surface. The spider secures the line and then drops another line from the centre, producing a \u2018Y\u2019 shape. The rest of the web is then constructed before the final sticky capture spiral is woven into place. Some species of Orb Weaver spiders remain in their webs day and night.Some Orb Weaving spiders do not build webs at all. Members of the genera Mastophora in the Americas, Cladomelea in Africa and Ordgarius in Australia produce sticky globules instead, which contain a pheromone analog (a chemical that triggers a natural behavioural response in another member of the same species). The globule hangs from a silken thread dangled by the spider from its front legs. The pheromone analog attracts male moths of only a few species. These get stuck on the globule and are reeled in to be eaten. Interestingly, both types of bolas spiders (unusual orb-weaver spiders that have given up spinning the typical web. Instead, they hunt by using a sticky \u2018capture blob\u2019 of silk on the end of a line) are highly camouflaged and difficult to locate.One feature of the webs of some orb-weavers is the \u2018stabilimentum\u2019, a crisscross band of silk through the centre of the web. It is found in a number of genera, but Argiope, which includes the common garden spider of Europe as well as the yellow and banded garden spiders of North America, is a prime example. The band has been hypothesized to be a lure for prey, a marker to warn birds away from the web and a camouflage for the spider when it sits in the centre of the web.Humped Orb Weavers build small flimsy, horizontal webs among shrubs and grasses or over water. They remain in their webs during the day and capture flies and other small insects.Most arachnid webs are vertical and the spiders usually hang with their head downward. A few webs, such as those of orb-weaver in the genus Metepiera have the orb hidden within a tangled space of web. Some Metepiera are semi-social and live in communal webs.",

            "orb weaver spider reproduction": "The female Garden Orb Weaver lays her eggs in late summer to autumn. The eggs are encased in a fluffy silken cocoon and attached to foliage. The life span is about 12 months. They mature in summer, mate, lay their eggs and die in late summer-autumn. Males and females are similar in size. During autumn, the spiderlings disperse by ballooning (floating on the breeze using small silk strands as \u2018balloons\u2019) and build their own tiny orb webs among vegetation.In the Golden Orb Weaver group, it is common for a number of tiny (6 millimetre) males to live around the edges of a females web, waiting for a mating opportunity. After mating, the female Golden Orb Weaver wraps her single egg sac in a mass of golden silk, which is then hidden on foliage away from the web, disguised within a curled leaf or sprig of twigs.Predators of orb weavers include several bird species and wasps of the family Sphecidae. The wasps land on the web, lure the spider to the perimetre by imitating a struggling insects vibrations and then carry the spider away to be paralysed and stored as live food for their young."

These species are: Scimitar-horned Oryx (Oryx dammah) of the North African deserts who are now possibly extinct in the wild and only have small populations living in protected areas. Arabian Oryx (Oryx leucoryx), which is the smallest species and lived the Arabian Peninsula before it became extinct in the wild in 1972. East African Oryx (Oryx beisa), found in Eastern and Southern Africa (East Africa has 2 types of oryx: Fringe-eared oryx (Oryx g. callotis) and Beisa oryx (Oryx g. beisa)). The Gemsbok is also considered an oryx and is closely related to the East African Oryx. In recorded history, the only antelope to become completely extinct was the South African Blue Buck which disappeared around 1800. Since then, however, most species of antelope have declined in numbers, coming close to extinction. Among the most threatened are the Addax, Scimitar Horned Oryx and the Arabian Oryx all of which are over hunted for their prized horns. ",
            "oryx description": "The oryx stands 1.4 metres (4.6 feet) at the shoulder and can weigh more than 200 kilograms (450 pounds). They have a head and body length of between 1.5 and 2.3 meters (4.9 to 7.5 feet). Oryx are very striking in appearance and all have distinctive long horns (both male and female have horns). Horns are made out of keratin just like our fingernails and they grow on an antelopes head during its lifetime. Their horns are very powerful weapons and oryx have been known to kill lions with them, that is why they are sometimes referred to as \u2018Sabre Antelopes\u2019.The horns of the oryx are long (around 30 inches), narrow, ringed and straight except for the Scimitars which curve backwards. Oryx have thick set necks with short manes and compact, muscular bodies. What makes the oryx such a beautiful creature is their characteristic markings on their bodies, face and legs. Their markings are black in color which contrast with their white faces and fawn colored bodies. These black distinctive markings begin on the faces and extend down the throat and chest, along their back and down to their flanks.The forelegs of an Oryx are white and have black rings above the knee. They have a black tasseled tail and black tipped ears. Their light colored coat helps them reflect the heat of the sun.The Arabian oryx is a uniform white, while the flank stripe is absent or only faint. The scientific name for the Arabian oryx, Oryx leucoryx, means \u2018white oryx\u2019. Their legs darken in the winter to absorb more of the suns heat.",
            "oryx habitat": "The Oryx prefers hot and arid environments such as steppes, deserts and semi deserts. They are well adapted to cope with the extremely hot climate.",
            "oryx diet": "Oryx are herbivores and feed in the early morning and late afternoon. Their diet consists of thick leaves, melons, rough grass and thorny shrubs. They also dig for tubers and roots in the ground. Oryx can survive without water for very long periods of time. Their kidneys are designed to minimise the loss of water through their urine and they only sweat when their body temperature exceeds 116 degrees Fahrenheit (46 degrees centigrade). The vegetation that the oryx consumes collects dew and provides both food and water.",
            "oryx behaviour": "Some oryxes are territorial and some are not. Those who are tend to mark their areas with their dung. Those who are not territorial live with herds of females and their young. Herds of 10 \u2013 40 individuals are common, however, some herds can contain over 200 animals particularly in Eastern African habitats.Most herds are led by the eldest male in the group. Herds have large ranges which they move slowly through, sometimes trotting. Their keen sense of smell enables them to sense when rain is falling in the area and they will head towards the rain to feed on the new growth of vegetation. The herds move to different areas as the seasons change.Male dominance is decided with conflicts to test their strength. Clashing of horns is sometimes involved. However, once the hierarchy is established, the need to fight is reduced.Predators of the oryx include lions, wild dogs and hyenas.",
            "oryx reproduction": "There is no specific breeding season for the oryx, however, general birth patterns are from December through to April. This is because the winter rains influence conception. After a gestation period of 8 \u2013 9 months the female gives birth to a single calf. Calves weigh around 10 kilograms at birth. The newborn calf is hidden away for 2 \u2013 3 weeks with the mother visiting 2 \u2013 4 times daily to feed it.Calves are brown at birth and their markings develop when it is old enough to join the herd. Calves are suckled for 6 \u2013 9 months. The female oryx will enter her estrous cycle again soon after giving birth. Oryxes reach maturity at 18 \u2013 24 months. The life span of an Oryx can be up to 20 years in preferred grazing conditions, however, droughts can reduce life expectancy greatly.",
            "oryx conservation status": "The Scimitar Horned Oryx is now listed as extinct in the wild where they once lived in North Africa. However, captive breeding programs have been a success and they have been reintroduced in Tunisia. Similar conservation programs around the world also exist for the other species of oryxes. Zoo populations of these desert antelopes are thriving because of cooperation between North American and European zoos."

            "desc": "The Osprey bird (Pandion haliaetus) is a medium-large raptor which is a specialist fish-eater with a worldwide distribution. It occurs in all continents around the world except for Antarctica, but in South America only as a non-breeding migrant. The Osprey bird is often known by other colloquial names such as \u2018fishhawk\u2019, \u2018seahawk\u2019 or \u2018Fish Eagle\u2019. Because the Osprey bird is a species with many unique characteristics it has therefore been given its own taxonomic genus, Pandion, and family, Pandionidae. The Osprey weighs around 1400 \u2013 2000 grams (3 \u2013 4.4 pounds) and has a length of 52 \u2013 60 centimetres (20.5 \u2013 24 inches). It has a 150 \u2013 180 centimetres (5 \u2013 5.9 feet) wingspan. The Osprey has mainly white underparts and head, apart from a dark mask through the eye, and fairly uniformly brown upperparts. Its short tail and long, narrow wings with four long \u2018finger\u2019 feathers (and a shorter fifth) give it a very distinctive appearance."

It has also been introduced to Australia. The ostrich is a member of the ratite (which means flightless bird) family of birds. It is the only living species in the family: Struthionidae and a member of the order: Struthioniformes which also includes Rheas, Emus, Kiwis and Cassowaries which are also large, flightless birds from different parts of the world. Ostriches can grow to measure 1.7 \u2013 2.8 metres (5.5 \u2013 9.4 feet) in height and weigh 130 \u2013 150 kilograms. Despite being flightless, Ostriches have small wings that are covered with fluffy feathers. The wings are too small to lift the Ostriches heavy bodies off the ground and into the air but are used as rudders when the bird is running to help it change direction.",

Despite being flightless, Ostriches have small wings that are covered with fluffy feathers. The wings are too small to lift the Ostriches heavy bodies off the ground and into the air but are used as rudders when the bird is running to help it change direction.Ostriches have long, bare necks, a flat, broad beak with a rounded tip and large eyes. They have long, powerful, bare legs and strong feet with 2 sharp claws on each foot which are used for defence. Their massive leg muscles enable them to deliver a powerful kick which could seriously injure or even kill an attacker. However, Ostriches can only kick forwards.Ostriches contain their main musculature in the hips and thighs. The long legs enable the Ostrich to run at speeds of over 65 kilometres per hour (40 miles per hour). A male Ostrich has a black plumage with white wing tips, however, females and chicks have a brownish, more duller plumage which helps them camouflage.In scorching desert conditions where temperatures may rise above 120 degrees fahrenheit, the Ostriches body is fine-tuned to stay around 18 degrees less. Any higher than this disrupts the Ostriches internal chemistry. Therefore, the Ostrich uses anatomy, physiology and behaviour in order to stay cool. Ostriches also have acute eyesight and hearing and can sense predators from far away.",
            "ostrich habitat": "The Ostriches preferred habitats are savanna, scrub, grasslands and semi-deserts. Ostriches enjoy water and often take baths where water sources are available. They are good swimmers too.",
            "ostrich diet": "Ostriches are omnivorous and will eat almost anything they can find. They eat a variety of foods from seeds and plant matter to lizards and frogs. Ostriches have no teeth and therefore often swallow pebbles to help with digestion in the gizzard. Food collects in the crop then slides down the neck in a bolus. The ostrich has intestines 14 metres long so that it gets the most out of the tough plants it eats. They are able to go without water for several days surviving on the moisture from plants instead. They are also capable of making their own water internally.",
            "ostrich behaviour": "Ostriches have a nomadic lifestyle and are mostly diurnal, active early and late in the day. They roam around the savannas in groups of 50 birds. Males are territorial and will defend their territory aggressively.Ostriches do not really bury their heads in the sand. When an Ostrich is threatened, it will lie flat on the ground to appear less obvious or run away. If caught, the Ostrich will kick out at its pursuer with its powerful legs.An Ostrich will also use posture to intimidate a rival or predator whereby it will fluff up its wing feathers and hiss loudly. Ostriches are designed for speed and most will comfortably outrun their predators which include lions, leopards and hyenas. Ostriches are very vocal birds and vocalizations include whistling, booming, hissing and snorting.",
            "ostrich reproduction": "During the breeding season around March/April, male Ostriches fight for harems of 2 \u2013 7 females with which to mate with. They defend their territory by patrolling and displaying and by making loud booming calls. They also inflate their bright pink necks. Ostriches engage in a unique form of co-operative breeding.After mating, several females from the neighbourhood will deposit their eggs in communal nest pits in the sand that have been dug by the male. Only the alpha female will work with the male to incubate the eggs taking it in turns to sit on the nest. Females sit on the eggs by day and males sit on the eggs by night.Ostrich eggs are around 16 centimetres in length, weigh 3 pounds and are glossy and cream in color. They are the largest bird eggs of all. Once hatched (after around 6 weeks), the brood of up to 40 chicks form creches. Sometimes Ostriches steal chicks from other birds to add to their own brood to make it larger.The male Ostrich is the main carer. The tiny ostriches immediately learn to follow the male, clustering around his feet as they try to keep up with the sometimes formidable strides (3 \u2013 5 metres long) of the group. The male Ostrich shows the chicks how to feed and protects them from predators and the elements using his wings to shelter them from the hot sun.During their first year, Ostrich chicks grow around 25 centimetres per month. Ostriches become sexually mature between 2 and 4 years of age although females mature around 6 months earlier than males. The life span of an Ostrich can be up to 75 years with around 50 years being typical.",
            "ostrich conservation status": "Ostriches are farmed in some parts of Africa for their skins and meat. Although Ostrich numbers have drastically declined over the last 200 years, they are still classed as \u2018Least Concern\u2019. There are around 2 million Ostriches worldwide.",
            "faqs": "The Ostrich has the largest eye of any land animal. Its eye is bigger than the worlds smallest bird, the Bee Hummingbird. Their eyes measure 2 inches (5 centimetres) across.An female Ostrich can lay 40 -100 eggs per year, averaging about 60 eggs per year.To soft boil a fresh ostrich egg would take 1 hour. To hard boil would take 1.5 hours.A female ostrich shows remarkable ability to recognize her own eggs even when mixed in with those of other females in their communal nest.The Ostrich is unable to fly and does not have a keeled sternum (breastbone) common to most birds.When fully grown, an ostrich has one of the most advanced immune systems known to mankind.Ostrich skeletons and fossils have been found dating back over 120 million years which means Ostriches are true dinosaurs.There are 3 main species of ostriches of which only one, the Struthio Camelus Domesticus (the African Black), is found in captivity.One ostrich egg is equivalent to the weight of about 24 chicken eggs.Ostriches are attracted to small, shiny objects and peck curiously at them."

            "pantropical spotted dolphin and humans": "The Pantropical Spotted Dolphins propensity for associating with Yellowfish Tuna, particularly in the eastern Pacific has in recent history been a very real danger. In the 1960s and 1970s fishermen would capture thousands of dolphin and tuna at once using purse seine nets. The dolphins all died. Over a period of about 25 years 75% of this regions population, and over half the worlds total was wiped out. The issue has received wide public attention. Many major supermarkets have found it economically expedient to use tuna suppliers whose fisherman catch tuna by more discriminatory means, and now advertise their tuna product as \u2018dolphin-friendly\u2019."

Paper wasps are usually brown with yellow markings on the head, thorax and bands on the abdomen. Paper wasps should not be confused with yellowjackets and baldfaced hornets. Paper wasp nests are open and cells are not covered with a cap (in an envelope).  Paper wasp colonies contain three castes: workers, queens and males. Fertilized queens, which appear similar to workers, hide themselves through the winter in protected habitats such as cracks and crevices in structures or under tree bark. In the spring they select a nesting site and begin to build a nest (nests are built from wood fibre collected from posts and occasionally from live plant stems).",
            "lifecycle": "Eggs are laid individually in cells and hatch into legless grub-like larvae that develop through several stages (instars) before pupating. Cells remain open until developing larvae pupate. Sterile worker wasps assist in building the nest, feeding young and defending the nest. A mature paper wasp nest may have 20 to 30 adults.In late summer, queens stop laying eggs and the colony soon begins to decline. In the fall, mated female offspring of the queen seek over-wintering sites. The remainder of the colony does not survive the winter and dies off."

The Indian Peafowl (Pavo cristatus) is a native bird to the Indian subcontinent and the Green Peafowl (Pavo muticus) breeds from east Burma to Java. Males are known as \u2018Peacocks\u2019 and females as \u2018Peahens\u2019. The Peacock is the national bird of India. Peacocks are well known for their magnificent, beautiful tail feather displays during courtship. ",
            "peafowl description": "The Peacocks brilliant \u2018train\u2019 contains over 200 shimmering feathers, each one decorated with eyespots. The male Indian Peacock has iridescent coloring of blue and green on its head, neck and breast. Their long \u2018trains\u2019 are not the tail quill feathers but elongated upper tail feather coverts. The train is bronze and green and has a series of \u2018eyes\u2019 which are more prominent when the tail is fanned.The male Indian Peafowls actual tail feathers are short and grey in color and can only be seen from behind when the tail is extended and fully fanned. The males display their beautiful fanned trains as part of their courtship behaviour to the Peahens. During molting season, the males shed their train feathers and their grey quill feathers are more obvious.Females lack the bright colors of the male and have a more duller appearance which is common in many other bird species. Peahens are generally brown in color with lighter underparts. They also lack the long upper tail coverts. They may have some iridescent green coloring on their neck.Both male and female Peafowl have crests on top of their heads which are also present on the Green Peafowl species. Green Peafowl differ in appearance to the Indian Peafowl in that the male has a green and gold plumage and their wings are black with a sheen of blue.Unlike the Indian Peafowl, Green Peahens are similar to the Green Peacocks only having shorter upper tail feather coverts and slightly less iridescent in some parts. In the months where the male has no train, it is difficult to tell females and males apart.Peafowl are large birds with males measuring up to 2.3 metres (7.5 feet) in length and females being smaller at 86 centimetres (34 inches) in length. The tail length of the male Peafowl can be 4 \u2013 5 feet.Peacocks weigh 9 \u2013 13 pounds and Peahens weigh 6 \u2013 9 pounds. Like other members of Galliformes, both male and female Peafowl have sharp, powerful metatarsal spurs also known as \u2018kicking thorns\u2019 which they use to defend themselves against predators. Their legs are strong and they have 3 strong toes facing forward and one facing backwards. Because their wing surface to bodyweight ratio is not large, most species are incapable of long flights.Apart from the Indian and the Green Peafowl, 1 or 2 mutations have been developed by those kept in captivity. One of them is a white Peafowl species called the Indian White Peafowl. Another species found in the rainforests of Central Africa is the Congo Peafowl.",
            "habitat": "Peafowl are mainly ground-dwelling birds preferring forests and farmland. They can also be found in bushlands and rainforests. Many will nest on the ground while some will roost in trees.",
            "diet": "Peafowl are omnivores and their diet consists of plants and flower petals, seeds, ants, termites, ticks and locust. They will also eat small reptiles such as young Cobra snakes, arthropods and amphibians.",
            "peafowl mating behaviour and peafowl reproduction": "The Peacock is a classic example of \u2018sexual selection\u2019 influencing evolution. Studies prove that Peahens prefer to mate with the most impressive males displaying the largest number of eyespots in their tails.Studies have shown that the males with the largest eyespots tend to father bigger, healthier and fitter young that are more likely to survive, proving that the beauty of the Peacock is more than skin deep. Peacocks molt their tail feathers around August time and begin to regrow them.During courtship, the male spreads his train of feathers and makes it shiver to attract the female. The male will often back towards the receptive female, swinging around to confront her with the magnificence of his display before taking several steps back and bowing. The display is followed by the male vocalising very loud calls known as \u2018crows\u2019 that are even louder than a Roosters crow. If the Peahen is impressed, she will join his harem of females, for like most male birds with a highly ornamented plumage, the Peacock is polygamous.Females are well equipped for their maternal roles with their discreet, cryptic coloration. Males play no part in rearing the young and being so conspicuous, would probably be a liability in the way of camouflage.Peahens generally reach breeding age at around 2 years, Peacocks at around 3 years. Peahens lay 6 \u2013 12 brownish, buff colored eggs from April to September. They are laid in a nest which has been scratched out in the ground and lined with grass. The Peahen will sit upon the eggs and incubate them for 28 days.Peachicks are born weighing 3.6 ounces (103 grams), fully feathered and can fly within a couple of weeks. They must learn to fly quite soon in order to stay with their mothers when roosting in trees to ensure survival from predators. Peachicks are taught how to eat and how to make a variety of sounds by the Peahen. Under the age of 1 year, young birds are called \u2018Peachicks\u2019. A males train of feathers will not be present for 3 years and will develop over this time. The life span of a healthy Peafowl can be 40 \u2013 50 years.",

Today there are four living species of peccaries, found from the southwestern United States through Central America and into South America and Trinidad. Collared peccaries are known as javelinas. A second species is the White-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), which is found in the rainforests of Central and South America. The third species, the Chacoan peccary (Catagonus wagneri), is the closest living relative to the extinct Platygonus pearcei. It is found in the dry shrub habitat or Chaco of Paraguay, Bolivia, Argentina and Southern Brazil. A fourth species, the Giant Peccary (Pecari maximus) was recently discovered in the Brazilian Amazon. Peccaries are similar to domestic pigs only they cannot be tamed due to their aggressive nature and are likely to cause injury or kill humans. The word javelina is a Spanish word meaning \u2018javelin\u2019 or \u2018spear\u2019 as they have razor sharp tusks. Peccaries are not members of the rodent family or the pig family.",
            "peccary description": "Peccaries measure between 90 \u2013 130 centimetres (3 \u2013 4 feet) in length and fully grown adults weigh between 20 \u2013 40 kilograms (44 \u2013 88 pounds). Peccaries have a striking resemblance to pigs in that they have a pig like snout ending in a cartilaginous disc. They have very small eyes and small ears. Just like pigs, they only use the middle two digits of their hooves for walking. Their stomach is non-ruminating, although it has three chambers and is more complex than that of a pigs.Peccary tusks are short, straight and razor sharp whereas pigs have long, curved tusks. Their tusks are used for defence. Their jaws are well adapted for crushing seeds and slicing plant roots. Peccaries have scent glands below each eye and on their backs which are used to mark territories. They have poor eyesight but very good hearing.",
            "peccary habitat": "Peccaries live in desert areas rich in vegetation or areas with canyons and cliffs where water is nearby. Peccaries spend most of their time resting and feeding. Resting occurs primarily in traditional bedding grounds located in low areas of thick brush or caves throughout their territory. Bedding grounds offer soft soil to lie on and protection from predators and the weather.",
            "peccary diet": "Peccaries are omnivores and there diet consists of small animals, grass, seeds, roots, prickly pear cactus and fruit. Peccaries normally come out in the evenings and early mornings to forage for food. Although they are not seen as predators they have been known to attack other animals.",
            "peccary behaviour": "Peccaries are sociable animals and can form herds of over 100 individuals although 6 \u2013 12 animals is normal. Peccaries are territorial animals and territories can range from 75 \u2013 700 acres. As well as marking their territories with their scent glands, they also mark other members of their herds by rubbing against each other. This behaviour and the pungent odour allows them to recognise other members of their herd, despite having myopic vision (nearsightedness). Their strong odour means that you will probably smell a peccary before actually seeing it, however, Peccaries are quite clean animals, pawing sand against their bellies in a cleaning motion.If approached by an intruder, peccaries click their tusks and sometimes charge at their opponent. Main predators of the peccary include coyotes, mountain lions and humans.",
            "peccary reproduction": "Peccaries have no specific breeding season and mate all year round but particularly in the rain season. The dominant male peccary generally does all the mating. Maternal dens are in hollow logs or hollows in the ground. Between 1 \u2013 3 young are born once a year after a gestation period of 140 \u2013 150 days.When the female is about to give birth, she will retreat from the rest of the herd to prevent the other members from eating the newborn. She returns after one day but only trusts her young with the older sisters of the newborn. The young are weaned at 2 \u2013 4 months. Peccaries reach sexual maturity at between 11 and 14 months old. The average life span of a peccary is 10 years in the wild and up to 24 years in captivity.",
            "peccary conservation status": "Peccaries are game animals. In Arizona they are hunted with bows and arrows, handguns and rifles. The Chacoan peccary is listed as \u2018Endangered\u2019, facing a very high risk of extinction, by the IUCN, primarily due to habitat loss, but also because it is hunted for bush meat (wild meat)."

            "desc": "When one thinks of Antarctic wildlife, penguins are often the first animals that come to mind. Penguins are birds with black and white feathers and a funny waddle. However, unlike most birds, penguins are unable to fly. Penguins spend as much as 75% of their time underwater, searching for food in the ocean. When they are in the water, they dive and flap their wings as if they are flying under water. The only time penguins are airborne is when they leap out of the water. Penguins will often do this to get a gulp of air before diving back down for fish. Penguins cannot breathe underwater, though they are able to hold their breath for a long time. Penguins also use their ability to leap out of the water to get from the ocean onto land if there are cliffs or ice flows to deal with. Penguins spend a lot of time dealing with temperature. They are warm blooded, just like people with a normal body temperature of about 100 degrees Fahrenheit.",
            "characteristics": "Penguins are shaped like a torpedo. Their body is built for the most efficient swimming with their average speed in the water being about 15 miles per hour.Just like whales, penguins have a layer of fat under their skin called \u2018blubber\u2019. Overtop of this they are covered with fluffy \u2018down\u2019 feathers and overtop of those they have their outer feathers which overlap to seal in warmth. Penguins rub oil from a gland onto their feathers to help make them waterproof and windproof.Even so, penguins often need help to stay warm. In the photo above you will see penguins huddled shoulder to shoulder with their wings tight against their body keeping each other warm. As many as 5,000 penguins will bunch together to warm each other up.Some penguins have the opposite problem. The Galapagos penguins live in such tropical weather that they can become too hot. These penguins spread out their wings and fluff out their feathers to help them keep cool.",
            "diet": "Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life caught while swimming underwater. Penguins spend a quarter of their life on land and three quarters in the oceans. If you look closely at a penguins beak you will notice a hook at the end, perfect for grabbing dinner.Penguins also have backward facing bristles on their tongues that helps slippery seafood from getting away.Penguins do not live near freshwater. Instead they drink salt water. Penguins have a special gland in their bodies that takes the salt out of the water they drink and pushes it out of grooves in their bill.A list of Penguin Species featured at Animal Corner:Adelie Penguin | African Penguin | Chinstrap Penguin | Ecrested Penguin | Emperor Penguin | Fiordland Penguin | Galapagos Penguin | Gentoo Penguin | Humboldt Penguin | King Penguin | Little Penguin | Macaroni Penguin | Magellanic Penguin | Rockhopper Penguin | Royal Penguin | Snares Penguin | Yelloweyed Penguin"

            "desc": "The peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) is a bird of prey (raptor) found worldwide, except for rainforests and cold, dry Arctic regions. Also simply known as the peregrine, these birds are large with a blue-grey back, barred white underparts, and a black head. They are known for their quick flight and are actually the fastest bird in the world, travelling at speeds of up to 320 km/h (200 mph). The peregrine falcon belongs to the family Falconidae and the genus Falco. There have been numerous subspecies of the peregrine falcon described, and currently 19 are recognized. The scientific name Falco peregrinus is a Medieval Latin phrase that was used by Albertus Magnus in 1225. These birds feed mainly on medium-sized birds, although will also sometimes take small mammals. They make their nests mostly in open habitats, but in recent years have also been known to make use of urban areas, particularly tall buildings where there is a lot of pigeon prey for them to eat.",
            "lifespan": "The peregrine falcon has a lifespan of around 13 years, although they have been known to live to 20 years in the wild. Despite this long lifespan, most peregrine falcons do not live to be a year old. In captivity, these birds can live for up to 25 years.",
            "diet": "The peregrine falcon feeds almost exclusively on birds, particularly mourning doves, pigeons, shorebirds, waterfowl, ptarmigan, grouse, and smaller songbirds, but it is though that between 1,500 and 2,000 bird species are eaten by this species. They will also eat small reptiles and mammals, such as bats, squirrels and rats.These birds sit at high vantage points, such as in trees or on cliffs, searching for their prey and, once prey has been detected, they will fly to catch it. Prey is typically struck and captured in mid-air. They catch their prey with their talons and generally kill with their beak by severing the cervical vertebrae.Small prey may be eaten in flight, but other, larger prey will be taken to an eating perch, where they are plucked and consumed. If prey is too heavy to carry, a peregrine will drop it to the ground and eat it there.Peregrine falcons may also fly or hover to search for prey. In some areas, where they eat insects, lizards, or mammals, they will search for food on the ground on foot.",
            "behavior": "Peregrine falcons are predominantly solitary birds except from during the breeding season. They are very territorial, with their home ranges between 177 to 1508 square kilometers. They are active during the day and will hunt up to 5 km from their home range. They may be more nocturnal in urban settings.The peregrine falcon is actually the fastest animal in the world \u2014 it can reach speeds of over 320 km/h (200 mph) when performing the swoop, which involves soaring to a great height and then diving steeply and hitting one wing of its prey so as not to harm itself on impact.",
            "reproduction": "Peregrine falcons are monogamous birds that breed for multiple years. They tend to return to the same breedings sites each nesting season, which may be one of the reasons they are monogamous. They breed between March and May, depending on how far north they are breeding. Prior to egg-laying, the pair will engage in incredible aerial displays, involving power dives, tight cornering, high soaring, and body rolls during a dive.The nests are usually on high cliffs, tall trees or skyscrapers. They are called \u2018scrapes\u2019, dug into the sand, gravel, vegetation or dirt. They may sometimes use nests that were built by other birds. The female chooses the nest site.Females will lay their eggs in mid-May and they usually hatch in mid-June. Peregrine falcons lay one egg every 48 hours, for a total of from 2 to 6 eggs. The eggs are white to buff with red or brown markings. Both parents incubate eggs and care for the young. Females generally incubate the eggs for greater proportions of the time than the males.Eggs hatch in 33 to 35 days and are brooded almost continuously until they are 10 days old. The young are covered with creamy-white down and have disproportionately large feet. They learn to fly around 35 to 42 days after hatching, and fledge after 42 to 46 days. The peregrine falcon reaches sexual maturity at one to three years of age, but in larger populations they breed after two to three years of age.An immature bird can be spotted as it is much browner, with streaked, rather than barred, underparts, and has a pale bluish cere and orbital ring.\u00a0Peregrine Falcon Location and HabitatPeregrine falcons are found worldwide and are actually one of the most widespread terrestrial vertebrate species in the world. The only places that they don\u2019t inhabit are the rainforests and cold, dry Arctic regions.Peregrine falcons like to live in open habitats such as deserts, seashores, mangroves, wetlands, tundra, grasslands, dry forests and scrubland. They are not usually found in sub-tropical and tropical habitats. They will live anywhere that provides good nesting space, such as tall trees and high cliffs. However, they\u2019ll also live in urban areas, on top of tall buildings.Most southern Palearctic and island populations of peregrine falcon are resident, and do not migrate. However, northernmost populations breed in the tundra of Alaska and Canada, and migrate to central Argentina and Chile. They migrate along sea coasts, long lake shores, barrier islands and mountain ranges, travelling very long distances.Peregrine Falcon Conservation StatusThe peregrine falcon is currently listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, however this has not always been the case. Peregrine falcon populations dropped dramatically in the middle of the 20th century, which was due to organochlorine pesticides (DDT and dieldrin). They were placed on the United States\u2019 endangered species list in 1969.Fortunately, thanks to a successful captive breeding and reintroduction program, combined with restrictions in pesticide use, the peregrine falcon population has been rebuilt.The peregrine falcon is a highly admired falconry bird, and has been used in falconry for more than 3,000 years, beginning with nomads in central Asia. They have been successfully bred in captivity, both for falconry and for release into the wild. Until 2004 nearly all peregrines used for falconry in the US were captive-bred.Peregrine falcons were removed from the United States\u2019 endangered species list in 1999, which is in large thanks to the effort and knowledge of falconers.",
            "predators": "Peregrine falcons are considered to be pretty close to the top of the food chain, but this doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have any predators. Adults can be killed by other, larger birds such as great horned owls and golden eagles.Young birds may be eaten by bears, cats, wolverines and foxes. In fact, this is so common, that many young don\u2019t make it to a year old. Peregrine falcon eggs are also taken by humans so the young can be raised for falconry.These birds are very defensive of their nests and will attack any predators, even those that are much larger than them.\u00a0Peregrine Falcon SubspeciesThere are nineteen subspecies of peregrine falcon that are found throughout the world.

Found throughout Europe, in Britain they are primarily concentrated in the Scottish highlands and Grampians, with smaller populations in parts of northern England and Wales. Reintroduction in England and Wales has been advocated, however, further study of their habitat needs and the likely impact on other species is needed before a formal programme could be carried out.",

Their fur grows longer and silkier during the winter months.Pine martens are the only mustelids with semi-retractable claws. This enables them to lead more arboreal lifestyles, such as climbing or running on tree branches, although they are also relatively quick runners on the ground. Pine Martens have small rounded, highly sensitive ears and sharp teeth for eating.",
            "habitats": "Pine Marten habitats are usually well wooded areas, but also rocky hillsides, crags and scrub. Pine Martens usually make their own dens in hollow trees or scrub-covered fields, or obscured within fallen trees and roots. Sometimes in cliffs, rock crevices or cairns.",

They have large territories of 5 \u2013 15 kilometres squared for females and perhaps twice as much for males.",
            "reproduction": "Pine martens reach sexual maturity at 2 or 3 years of age. The young are usually born in March or April after a one month gestation period in litters of 1 to 5. Young Pine martens weigh around 30 grams at birth. The young begin to emerge out of their dens by the middle of June and are fully independent around 6 months after their birth. The male Pine marten plays no part in rearing the young.The Pine marten has lived to 18 years in captivity, however, in the wild a life span of 8 to 10 years is more typical.",
            "conservation status": "Although they are preyed upon occasionally by golden eagles and even more rarely by red foxes, humans are the largest threat to Pine Martens. Martens are prized for their very fine fur and loss of habitat leading to fragmentation, persecution by gamekeepers, human disturbance, illegal poisoning and shooting have caused a considerable decline in the Pine Marten\u2019s population. In the United Kingdom, Pine Martens and their dens are offered full protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981) and the Environmental Protection Act.Recently (December, 2007) the Pine Marten was credited with reducing the population of the invasive Eastern Grey Squirrel in the UK. Where the range of the expanding Pine Marten population meets that of the Grey Squirrel, the population of the squirrels quickly retreats. It is theorised that because the Grey Squirrel spends more time on the ground than the endangered Red Squirrel, they are far more likely to come in contact with this predator.\u00a0Pine Marten Coloring PagePine Marten QuizAnimals starting with P"

            "diet": "Piranhas are opportunistic carnivores (flesh-eaters). They eat aquatic and land animals that are in the water. Some of their prey includes fish, mollusks, crustaceans, insects, birds, lizards, amphibians, rodents and carrion (carcasses). Piranhas are diurnal (most active during the day).Piranhas generally eat smaller fish. Larger fish and small mammals may be attacked if there is a school of piranhas.Foraging methods vary in the different life stages of Piranhas. During the day, smaller fish typically search for food whilst at dawn, late afternoon and early evening the larger fish search for food.Piranha groups feed communally. Feeding frenzies will be triggered when there is a shortage of food or blood in the water.\u00a0",
            "habitat": "Piranhas are typically found in white-water streams. Piranha Fish are important components of their native environments. Although largely restricted to lowland waters, these fishes are widespread and inhabit diverse habitats within both lotic (interactions within flowing continental waters) and lentic (interactions within still continental waters) environments. Some piranha species are abundant and multiple species often occur together.\u00a0",
            "behaviour": "The piranha fish is commonly portrayed and known as a vicious species of fish hunting in large schools.This conception was created from the past belief that piranhas created schools for hunting purposes.Recent research, however, suggests that this is actually used as a defence mechanism against the piranhas natural predators.\u00a0",
            "predators": "Many animals prey upon piranhas (especially young piranhas), including other piranhas, caimans, water snakes, turtles, birds, otters and people.\u00a0",
            "reproduction": "Piranhas reproduce by laying groups of eggs in rivers and lakes.The breeding environments of piranhas tend to be main bodies of water such as lagoons. Piranhas will change color during spawning with the red belly Piranha fish getting more intense and the whole piranha becoming slightly lighter.The pair will defend their spawning territory and prepare a nest not unlike the breeding behaviour of birds. The female lays clusters of eggs into a bowl shaped nest created in the sediment. These are around 4 or 5 centimetres in depth and 15 centimetres in diameter.The eggs will then be fertilised by the male. The eggs hatch after two to three days, depending on the temperature of the water. The piranha fish parents protect both the eggs and their brood. Females are most fertile during the rainy season in April and May.\u00a0",
            "conservation status": "Piranhas have no special status on the IUCN Endangered Species Red list.\u00a0",
            "and humans": "Reports of Piranhas biting people in their native habitats are rare, so the danger of Piranhas is exaggerated. However, Piranhas have bitten people who put their hands in an aquarium full of Piranhas.While many humans fear these fish, there are thousands of natives that swim in the same bodies of water with these fish and go unharmed.Stories about schools of piranhas turning horses or people into skeletons within seconds are the result of numerous re-tellings and exaggerations over the years. While piranha schools can reach over a thousand in count and bites do happen, there are no documented reports of someone being killed in a piranha attack.Locals use the teeth of piranha fish in tools and weapons. Piranha fish are also a popular food, though if caught on a hook or line it may be attacked by other piranhas.Piranha fish are commonly consumed by fishermen and frequently sold for food in local markets. In recent decades, dried specimens have been marketed as tourist souvenirs.Piranhas occasionally bite and sometimes injure bathers and swimmers, but truly serious attacks are rare and the threat to humans has been largely exaggerated. However, piranhas are a considerable nuisance to commercial and sport fishers because they steal bait, mutilate catch, damage nets and other gear and may bite when handled."

            "desc": "The Plains Zebra (Equus quagga, formerly Equus burchelli) is the most common and geographically widespread form of zebra. These Zebra were once found on plains and grasslands from the south of Ethiopia right through east Africa as far south as Angola and eastern South Africa. Plains Zebra inhabit open, grassy plains or well-grassed woodlands. Plains Zebra are much less numerous than they once were, because of human activities such as hunting for their meat and hides, as well as invasion on much of their former habitat, however, they remain common in game reserves. ",
            "characteristics": "Plains Zebra are medium sized and thick-bodied with relatively short legs. Both male and female Plains zebra stand about 1.4 metres (4.6 feet) high at the shoulder, are approximately 2.3 metres (8 feet) long and weigh about 294 kilograms (646 pounds) however males may weigh 10% more than females.Like all zebra, they are boldly striped in black and white and no two individuals look exactly alike. All have vertical stripes on the forepart of the body, which travel towards the horizontal stripes on their hindquarters. The northern species of Plains Zebra have narrower and more defined striping whereas southern populations have varied but lesser amounts of striping on the under parts, the legs and the hindquarters.Like all zebra, Plains zebra have acute vision and hearing which helps them detect predators early. They also have an excellent sense of taste in which they can detect slight changes of their food quality.",
            "diet": "These zebra graze two-thirds of the day on red oat grass, bark, roots and stems. They will also eat a variety of grasses, along with some additional browse like leaves and twigs. Plains zebra live in eastern and southeastern Africa where there are only two seasons, wet and dry. Zebra rely on rainfall for food and water and therefore have to go on great migrations to follow the rains. The zebra will migrate up to 700 miles for food. Other grazers also must do the same thing. Plains zebra can not survive very long without water and must be at least 25 \u2013 30 kilometres from a water source.",
            "social structure": "Plains zebra stay in family groups of a stallion, or male and several mares, however, different families will come together in huge herds of hundreds of zebras. Herds will mingle with wildebeests, ostriches and antelope while they graze and even come to depend on them as additional protection against predators. Zebra are always busy and alert and very noisy. They make a lot of sounds. During the rainy season in the Serengeti, aggregate herds of up to 10,000 individuals may form, part of one of the last great wildlife spectacles in the world.Plains Zebra communicate with each other. The mares will produce a \u2018whiney\u2019 sound when separated from their foals and \u2018nicker\u2019 to warn of danger. The zebra alarm is a \u2018yelping bark\u2019 which they all make as they make their escape from predators.Mares exist in a hierarchy with the alpha female being the first to mate with the stallion and being the one to lead the group. When new mares are added to the group, they are met with hostility by the other mares. Thus the stallion must shield the new mares until the aggression subdues.Zebra strengthen their social bonds with grooming. Members of a harem nip and scrape along the neck, shoulders and back with their teeth and lips. Mothers and foals groom the most often followed by siblings. Grooming shows social status and eases aggressive behaviour.",
            "reproduction": "In the wild, mares reach sexual maturity between 2 \u2013 4 years. Males are able to compete for mares after they reach about 4 years of age. When gathering females for breeding, rival stallions compete fiercely by pushing, kicking and biting each other. Once a male establishes a harem, ownership of that harem is rarely disputed, unless he is unfit or sick. The gestation period of a zebra is about 12 \u2013 13 months (365 \u2013 390 days).Since a mare may come into estrus (ready for breeding) within days of giving birth, she can conceive almost yearly. The female gives birth to usually one foal, as twins are rare. At birth, a foal weighs about 70 pounds (32 kilograms). The foal can stand almost immediately and run within a day. Although a foal may graze within a week of birth, they continue to suckle for up to 16 months.The average infant mortality is about 50%, mostly due to predation by lions and spotted hyena. The average life span of the Plains zebra is 20 \u2013 25 years in the wild and 40 years in captivity.",
            "predators": "The Plains zebra main predators are lions and spotted hyenas. Nile crocodiles are also great threats during river crossings. Wild dogs, cheetahs and leopards also prey on zebra, although the the threats they pose are generally minor. For protection from land predators the Zebra retreats into open areas with good visibility at night time.",

            "the grant\u2019s zebra": "The Plains zebra has differentiated into several subspecies, two of which are now extinct. The Grant\u2019s zebra (Equus burchelli boehmi), pictured left, is the most common of the plains zebra subspecies. The Grant\u2019s zebra is the best studied of the plains zebra and much of what we know of the behaviour and biology of the species comes from work done with this subspecies in the wild and in zoos.With broad black stripes on a white background (Africans, reportedly, see white strips on a black background), this subspecies is the zebra most frequently seen in zoos around the world. In the wild its distribution extends from southern Sudan through East Africa south to the Zambesi River.There may be some 300,000 left in the wild, on the Serengeti-Mara Plains alone there are an estimated 150,000 plains zebras. During the rainy season in the Serengeti, aggregate herds of up to 10,000 individuals may form, part of one of the last great wildlife spectacles in the world.",
            "chapman\u2019s zebra": "The Chapman\u2019s zebra or the Damara zebra (Equus burchelli antiquorum) is a subspecies of Plains zebra occurring from Angola and Namibia across northern South Africa to Transvaal. It is characterized by a pattern of broad, dark stripes alternating with thin, light shadow-stripes. The stripes fade into the brownish color of the body on the hindquarters and are absent altogether on the legs.",
            "burchell\u2019s zebra": "Another southern subspecies of the Plains zebra, the Burchell\u2019s zebra (Equus burchelli burchelli), now extinct, lacked stripes on the hindquarters. Its basic body color was reddish-yellow.Burchell\u2019s zebra existed from southern Botswana into the Orange Free State of South Africa. As European settlement spread northward from the Cape to colonial Southern Rhodesia, this subspecies was hunted to extinction. The wild herds had disappeared by 1910 and the last known individual died in the Berlin Zoo in 1918.",
            "conservation status": "The Plains zebra endangerment situation is less alarming than that of other zebra. The Plains zebra is the most abundant wild member of the horse family, with a wide range and numbers probably exceeding 750,000. However, on a local level, the Plains Zebra is still threatened by hunting and by habitat change from ranching and other kinds of farming.",

Poison Arrow Frogs are recognised by their beautiful bright colors, yellow, black, blue, orange, green and red. There are about 220 species of Poison Arrow Frogs. Most species of Poison Arrow Frogs are not toxic to animals and humans. However, more than 100 toxins have been identified in the skin secretions of some Poison Arrow Frogs. Poison Arrow Frogs usually live on the forest floor but when breeding they venture into the forest canopy. The female Poison Arrow Frog lays her eggs on the land, about 4 \u2013 6 at a time.",
            "reproduction of the poison arrow frog": "The majority of members of this family of frogs that have been studied are characterized by unusual reproductive strategies for amphibians. In some species, eggs are laid on the forest floor by the female, often following elaborate courtship behaviours by the male. One parent (generally the male) guards the eggs until they hatch.The newly hatched tadpoles wriggle onto the back of either the male or female parent, who transports them to water. In some species, tadpoles are carried to small pools of water isolated in tree holes or other phytotelmata (water filled cavities in the woody parts of trees, axils of bromeliads or fallen plant parts on the forest floor). In a few species, females return repeatedly to these tree holes to feed the tadpoles unfertilised nutritive \u2018nurse\u2019 eggs, which the tadpoles rely on as a major (or only) source of food.

While caterpillars can be a nuisance to gardens, eating your beloved plants, you shouldn\u2019t go around picking up these little creatures without knowing whether they are safe to be handled or not. More frustratingly, sometimes you might not even be able to see them because they are so good at camouflaging themselves in their environment. So, how do you know which species are poisonous are which are not? How dangerous are they? Below we will be exploring everything there is to know about poisonous caterpillars, so you can be safe. Keep reading on to find out more.",
            "how do caterpillars become poisonous?": "Some caterpillars feed on poisonous plants like milkweed, and store their poison inside. Others, however, have hollow quill-like hairs, connected to poison sacs. When these hairs are touched, they pierce the skin releasing poison. Reactions can range from a mild itching to the more severe pain, swelling, blistering, dermatitis, and even intestinal disturbances.The older the caterpillar, the more potent its sting will be, with the most powerful right before it pupates.",

The general rule is, caterpillars that are brightly colored, have spines or hairs are probably venomous and should not be touched.The safest thing to do is leave the caterpillar alone until you can identify it and know if it is poisonous or not. Use our list below to see whether the caterpillar is dangerous or not.",
            "what is the difference between a venomous and a poisonous caterpillar?": "There are differences between a venomous and poisonous caterpillar. A poisonous caterpillar will harm you if you touch, breathe or consume it due to the toxic substance it carries. On the other hand, a venomous caterpillar injects a toxin or poison through a sting.",

The Polar Bear is the worlds largest carnivore species found on land. Although it is closely related to the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrow ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water and for hunting seals which make up most of its diet. Polar Bears have a thick fur coat either white or cream in color, which helps them blend into their surroundings and stay hidden from prey although their black noses sometimes gives them away. A Polar Bears skin, visible only on the nose and footpads, is black. The black color enables the bear to absorb sunlight energy to warm its body. Polar bear fur is oily and water repellent. The hairs do not become matted when wet, allowing the polar bears to easily shake free water and any ice that may form after swimming. Polar Bears have a relatively narrow head with a long muzzle and long neck. ",
            "habitat": "Polar Bears inhabit ice fields or dug out dens in the snow.",
            "diet": "Although Polar Bears are mostly carnivores and are dependant up on the fat of marine mammals for much of its energy, the Polar Bear is a highly adaptable opportunist omnivore and in times of need, will eat berries, kelp and rubbish. Growing Polar Bears eat the meat of marine animals while adults eat mainly Seal blubber.Polar Bears need an average of 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of fat per day to obtain enough energy to survive. A Ringed Seal weighing 55 kilograms (121 pounds) could provide up to 8 days of energy for a Polar Bear. Polar Bears are natural scavengers and are thought to \u2018play with their food\u2019. They do this before killing it (like a cat would). This action is thought to be practice for hunting and prey-handling techniques. Their main prey are Ringed Seals and sometimes Bearded Seals, but they will eat anything they can kill including young Walruses, Whales, Fish, Sea Birds and Caribous.Polar Bears cover vast distances in search of food, swimming across water and coming far inland. Polar Bears sometimes dig down into Seal dens and eat new born Seal pups. These bears can smell Seals up to 60 kilometres across the ice. Polar Bears tend to gain a lot of weight during the summer months because they have less opportunities to feed during the winter. Polar Bears do not drink water, they obtain all their moisture from the food that they eat. Hibernating Polar Bears do not eat.",
            "behaviour": "Polar Bears spend much of their time sleeping or roaming the ice in search of Seals. Adults are good swimmers, however, small cubs drown easily. For this reason, young families stay close on solid ice. Polar Bears are typically solitary, males and females come together to mate for just a few days in late winter or early spring. Pregnant females overwinter in dens dug into the snow within a few kilometres of the coastline.The Polar Bears home range and territories are huge and can measure up to 125,000 square kilometres (48,250 square miles) because their prey is sparsely distributed. To hunt their prey, Polar Bears sit very still by a hole in the ice and wait for Seals to surface to breathe. When a Seal appears, the bear strikes it with a front paw and drags it out onto the ice before biting its head.On the surface of the ice, they rely on their superb camouflage to stalk resting seals. When a resting seal is spotted, they creep up as close as they can and when within range, they can run at around 45 kilometres per hour (30 miles per hour) to capture their prey.Sometimes, Polar Bears swim under water and come up under an ice floe to tip Seals off. They may also throw huge chunks of ice at Seals to stun them, Even so, only a few hunts are successful, so scavenging is very important. Carcasses of Whales, Walruses, Caribous and Musk Ox are an important source of food.Polar Bears have an excellent sense of smell and can detect a carcass from a great distance. As natural scavengers, Polar Bears will investigate novel items which can lead to problems near human settlements in the Arctic. Some Polar Bears have suffered serious internal injuries due to eating man-made materials. The retreat of the sea ice in summer can leave Polar Bears stranded on land and unable to reach Seals \u2013 their preferred prey therefore, scavenging is the only option if this occurs.Polar Bears are excellent swimmers and can swim at speeds of 9.7 kilometres per hour (6 miles per hour). Polar Bears usually swim under water at depths of only about 3 \u2013 4.5 metres (9.8 \u2013 14.8 feet). They can remain submerged for as long as 2 minutes and are able to close their nostrils when under water. Polar Bears have an average walking speed of 5.5 kilometres per hour (3.5 miles per hour).",
            "reproduction": "Polar Bears mature at around 6 years. Polar bears breed in the summer months from March through to June. Females give birth in their dug-out overwinter dens where they give birth to 2 -3 tiny cubs. The timing of the birth is sometime during early winter between December and January.Female Polar Bears are capable of delayed implantation. Delayed implantation assures that the cub is born during the best time of the year for survival and allows the female to get into good physical condition and use her energy for nursing her newborn cubs. Cubs are born covered in fur but with their eyes closed.Cubs weigh around 600 grams (1,4 pounds). Females remain in hibernation nursing their cubs until April. Females may go without eating for up to 8 months, surviving only on their body fat, while over-wintering and feeding their newborn young. By the time the young family emerge, the cubs may have grown to weigh 10 \u2013 15 kilograms (22 \u2013 33 pounds). The cubs stay with their mother for the next 2 \u2013 3 years during which time she provides for them.The female will teach her cubs how to hunt and protect the from harm. The most constant social interaction occurs between mother and cubs. Polar bear mothers are attentive, frequently touching and grooming their cubs. Polar Bear cubs chase after and tackle their siblings. The life span of a Polar Bear is around 30 years.",
            "vocalisations": "Adult Polar Bears vocalize most when they are agitated or threatened. Sounds include hissing, growling, champing of teeth and chuffing. Cubs vocalize more often and for diverse reasons. Sounds include hissing, squalling, whimpering, lip smacking and throaty rumblings. Mothers warn cubs with a chuffing or braying sound. Polar bears also communicate through sight, touch and smell.\u00a0Polar Bear Conservation StatusPolar Bears are classed as \u2018Vulnerable\u2019 with 5 of the 19 polar bear subpopulations in decline. The IUCN now lists global warming as the most significant threat to the Polar Bear, primarily because the melting of its sea ice habitat reduces its ability to find sufficient food.\u00a0"

However, due to heavy persecution by gamekeepers up until the late 1930\u2019s, polecats where in decline everywhere except for a small population in North Wales. Recovery of populations has resulted in them now being widespread throughout rural Wales, the Border counties and are spreading across the Midlands, South and into the South-East.",

There are, in total, 27 species of porcupine belonging to the families, Erethizontidae or Hystricidae. Porcupines (like monkeys) are divided into New World (Erethizontidae) and Old World (Hystricidae) porcupines and are quite different from each other and are not closely related.",
            "description": "Porcupines vary in size considerably depending on species, however, they generally measure 60 \u2013 90 centimetres (25 \u2013 36 inches) in length (excluding tail which measures 20 \u2013 25 centimetres (8 \u2013 10 inches)) and weigh between 5 \u2013 16 kilograms (12 \u2013 35 pounds). The smallest porcupine is the Rothschilds Porcupine from South America which weighs only 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds). The largest porcupine is the African Porcupine which can weigh over 20 kilograms (44 pounds).Porcupines have rounded bodies covered with many spines or quills and can be grey, brown or white in color. Their spines are modified hairs coated with thick plates of keratin that are used to defend them from predators. The spines usually lie flattened, however, when threats are posed, the spines spring up as a deterrent to predators. Porcupines have blunt muzzles and small eyes and ears. Their legs are short and sturdy and there are 5 toes on each foot with powerful claws at the ends.Old World porcupines (Hystricidae) are larger and their spines are grouped in clusters whereas New World porcupines (Erethizontidae) are smaller and have their spines attached singly. Spines or quills are about 75 millimetres (3.0 inches) long and 2 millimetres (0.079 inches) wide.The spines of the New World porcupines have backward facing barbs on the ends that are painful and difficult to remove from skin when embedded. The spines are extremely sharp and will easily detach from the porcupine if touched. Predators have been know to die from being penetrated with a porcupine spine as the barbs are designed to penetrate further into the skin with normal muscle movements.The porcupines stomach is filled with symbiotic microorganisms (bacteria, fungi (yeasts) and protozoans) which help break down the plants eaten into a usable form. The porcupines stomach is the only area not protected by quills.",
            "habitat": "Porcupine habitats range from deserts, forests and grasslands. Some species of New World porcupines live in trees, however, Old World porcupines are exclusively terrestrial (ground dwellers). Some inhabit rocky regions up to 3,500 metres (11,000 feet) high. They can also be found living in rock crevices, hollow logs and small caves.",
            "diet": "Porcupines are nocturnal herbivores and eat a large variety of vegetation including plants, shrubs and leaves. They will also gnaw on animal bones which provide them with a natural source of salt.",
            "behaviour": "Porcupines have poor vision but have an acute sense of smell. They are very vocal animals and make shrill screeches, whines and low grunts. Porcupines are not territorial animals, however, their home range can be as large as 200 acres. They are very fond of salt licks and sometimes wander into human settlements to find salt sources. They will also gnaw at salt placed down to thaw ice on roads which can lead to death or injury through being knocked by motor vehicles.Porcupines generally live in family groups of 5 \u2013 6 individuals in complex burrow systems. Some, such as the African Porcupines live in monogamous pairs and form family groups who share the burrows. During the winter, porcupines huddle together for warmth.Despite their protective exterior, there are some animals that prey upon porcupines. The Fisher (a North American marten) is the most feared predator, however, they are also preyed upon by great horned owls, coyotes, bobcats, mountain lions and wolves. The porcupine will attempt to warn off potential predators by giving out a growl or hiss, stamping its feet, clicking its teeth and vibrating its spines or quills. If this fails, the porcupine will run backwards and ram the attacker which is very affective as the spines face backwards and are more numerous on its rear.",
            "reproduction": "Porcupines have no specific breeding season, however, they have only one litter per year. The female initiates courtship by presenting herself to the male and flattening her spines to enable mating to take place. After a gestation period of 112 days (around 3 months), 1 or 4 young are born, depending on species. Before giving birth, the female will line the maternal chamber of the burrow system with grass and leaves to make the nest comfortable.Young porcupines are called \u2018porcupettes\u2019. Porcupettes have no spines or quills at birth but are covered with sensitive, soft bristles. Their eyes open shortly after birth and they are able to leave the nest after one week. Their spines then develop and harden and they are able to consume solid food at 2 \u2013 3 weeks old. Males help with the parental care of the young. Most young porcupines are ready to live on their own at about 2 months of age. They reach maturity when they are 1 \u2013 2 years old.

In addition, they consume grains, frogs, plants, fruits, and eggs.Possums require large levels of calcium in their diet.\u00a0As a result, possums quickly consume the skeleton remains of rodents and other creatures that have died on the road.What predators do Possums have?Dogs, raccoons, coyotes, foxes, bobcats, big hawks, and great horned owls are among the main predators.Dingos, as well as snakes and lizards, may prey on Australian possums. It\u2019s not out of the question that some species of birds may potentially kill and consume a possum.Do Possums make good pets?No, these animals are not suitable as pets. Possums are wild animals even though they have a lovely and cuddly appearance. A lot of places forbid keeping one as a pet.",
            "s behaviour": "Being nocturnal, possums typically feed between dark and sunrise. They are generally solitary animals.Brushtail possums will only seek out companionship when they wish to reproduce.With ringtail possums, they live in bigger families where one male and one or two females will share a den, forage for food together at night, and share parental responsibilities. The only possum known to now assist in raising its young is the male Ringtail Possum.When a Ringtail or Brushtail possum is born, the young one will crawl to the mother\u2019s pouch and nurse from a teat there for around 4-5 months. Before fully weaning, the young leave the pouch and continue to nurse for another 4\u20138 weeks while riding on their parent\u2019s back.Possums begin to have sexual activity at the age of 13 months. Possums have a long reproductive cycle with an average lifespan of 6-7 years and a maximum lifespan of 11 years. The Common Ringtail Possum can have up to 3 joeys at a time.Possums have amazing agility! They have been reported to leap from a tree to a roof up to 4 metres distant and can climb vertical walls! They have the strength to remove roof tiles and fit through tiny openings. They have been observed balancing on delicate branches and strolling alongside power lines.Possums use both sound and smell to communicate with one another and with prospective enemies. Screeches, hisses, clicks, grunts, and howls are all part of their repertoire of alarm calls, mating calls, and location calls. To mark their territory, they also have smell glands on their chest.They are as nimble and creative as they are!

Other species, which may be found in gardens, parks, and farms, actually prefer to reside close to humans.Unfortunately, human interaction harms a wide variety of possum species. Population decline is a result of several anthropogenic factors, including habitat destruction, poaching, capture for the exotic pet trade, climate change, and many others.",
            "habitat": "Because there are so many different species, environment preferences vary greatly. Since the majority of these species inhabit trees, their habitats must contain some mature vegetation.These marsupials live in a variety of habitats, including eucalyptus forests, mangroves, woodlands, shrubland, and forests. They live in lowlands, mountainous regions, as well as desert, semi-arid, temperate, and tropical climates.",
            "diet": "Possums often consume only plants or both plants and small animals, respectively, making them herbivorous or omnivorous. While some species focus only on a few types of plants or foods, others eat almost anything. Insects, invertebrates, leaves, buds, fruits, berries, seeds, nuts, nectar, flowers, and more are all part of their varied diets.Possums have evolved to prefer an omnivorous diet that includes insects, eggs, and other plant materials, some of which are harmful to other animals. They will also scavenge on food that other animals and people have left over if given the chance.They are best described as opportunistic because the precise nutritional composition fluctuates depending on the food supply in each place. To ferment and digest their diet of foods high in fibre, several possum species have an expanded cecum (a pouch in the intestines). Sharp points on the molar teeth enable them to efficiently chew through tough plant material."

            "potter wasp life cycle": "Potter wasp adults feed on flower nectar and collect small caterpillars to feed their young. The caterpillars are paralyzed with the wasp\u2019s sting and piled into the brood cell which is the compartment in which the wasp larvae develops. The female wasp then lays an egg on the stored caterpillars. The Potter wasp larvae consumes from 1 to 12 caterpillars as it grows. Potter wasps are important in the natural control of caterpillars."

            "desc": "A Praying Mantis, or praying mantid, is the common name for an insect of the order Mantodea. These insects are notorious predators and their name is sometime mistakenly spelled \u2018Preying Mantis\u2019 which is incorrect. They are in fact named for the typical \u2018prayer-like\u2019 stance. There are approximately 2,000 mantid species worldwide. The majority are found in Asia. About 20 species are native to the USA. Like all insects, a praying mantis has a three segmented body, with a head, thorax and abdomen. The abdomen is elongated and covered by the wings in adults.",
            "senses": "The Praying Mantis has huge compound eyes mounted on a triangular head and have a large range of vision. They use sight for detecting movement of prey and swivel their heads to bring their prey into a binocular field of view.They have a fully articulated head and are able to rotate it 180 degrees as well as pivot it. Their antennae are used for smell.",
            "diet": "Being a carnivorous insect, the praying mantis feeds primarily on other insects such as Fruit Flies, Crickets, Beetles, Moths and Bees. However, it is not uncommon for larger mantids to consume small reptiles, birds and even small mammals.To capture their prey, mantids use their camouflage to blend in with the surroundings and wait for the prey to be within striking distance. They then use their raptorial front legs to quickly snatch the victim. It then uses the front legs to help position the victim so it may eat it better.",
            "habitat": "Praying mantids can be found in all parts of the world with mild winters and sufficient vegetation. Praying mantids will spend most of their time in a garden, forest or other vegetated area.",
            "predators": "The primary predators of the praying mantis are frogs, bats, monkeys, larger birds, spiders and snakes. Praying mantids will also prey on each other, usually during the nymph stage and during mating and also when there is no other prey.",
            "defence": "When threatened, praying mantids stand tall and spread their forelegs to allow them to penetrate the target, with their wings fanning out wide and mouths open. The fanning of the wings is used to make the mantis seem larger and to scare the opponent.Some species have bright colors and patterns on their hind wings and inner surfaces of their front legs for this purpose. If harassment persists, the mantis will then strike with their forelegs and attempt to pinch, bite or slash its opponent. They also may make a hissing sound.Mantids do not develop wings until the final molt. Some mantids do not develop wings at all, or may have small flightless wings. The only time mantids fly is when the adult female begins to emit pheromones which attract males for mating. Male mantids fly at night, as they seem to be attracted to artificial lights.",
            "reproduction": "The reproductive process in a majority of mantis species is marked by sexual cannibalism whereby the female eats the male after mating has taken place and is an ongoing subject of research.Praying mantids start out life in an ootheca egg mass (an ootheca usually contains many eggs surrounded by a foam of protein which may then harden into a tough casing for protection).Usually laid in the fall on a small branch or twig, the egg mass then hatches in the spring to early summer as warming temperatures signal the time for birth.The natural life span of a praying mantis in the wild is about 10 \u2013 12 months, but some mantids kept in captivity have been sustained for 14 months. In colder areas, female mantids will die during the winter.Males tend to \u2018suddenly\u2019 die about 2 to 3 weeks after mating in the fall. This is usually caused by the females urge to kill off the male once the egg pouch has been produced.",
            "conservation status": "Most North American mantids are not included among endangered species however species in other parts of the world are under threat from habitat destruction. The European Mantis (Mantis religiosa) is the state insect of Connecticut, but the General Statutes of Connecticut do not list any special protected status, it is a non-native species from Europe and Northern Africa."

Behaviours such as mating and birth may occur in water or on land. Their skin is greenish-black, shading to a creamy grey on the lower body.Pygmy hippos are good swimmers and have strong muscular valves that close off their ears and nostrils when they submerge into the water.Whereas the Common Hippo produces a red fluid from their skin, the Pygmy Hippo secretes a white fluid which has the same effect of protecting their skins from the sun and infections.Unlike the Common Hippo, the eyes on a Pygmy Hippo are placed on the sides of their heads and their nostrils are lower down on their muzzles. They have four toes on each foot that are more widely spread with less webbing than the Common Hippos, giving them more stability on land.",

Pygmy Hippos have sharp teeth and large canines and show them off with their large \u2018yawn\u2019 type posture to intimidate possible enemies if they feel threatened.Because of their secretive, nocturnal habits, little is known about Pygmy Hippo lifestyle. What is known is that Pygmy Hippos are not a gregarious as Common Hippos. They tend to live singular or in pairs. Pygmy Hippos are also not territorial \u2013 a Pygmy Hippos will wander into another Pygmys home range without problems. A Pygmys home range is well defined with paths of dung which they spread with their tails during defecation (having a poo).Occasionally, the males may fight over females in which they use the same techniques as the Common Hippo \u2013 using their teeth and jaws. When male and female Pygmy Hippos are found together, they are probably consorting (keeping each other company) before mating. This courtship is not found in Common Hippos.Mating takes place in or out of the water. Mating age begins at about 3 years old in Pygmys. The Pygmy hippo female carries her baby for about 6 \u2013 7 months and then gives birth to one single calf. The calve will weigh around 10 \u2013 14 pounds. A Pygmy hippopotamuses life span is between 30 and 50 years.Pygmy Hippopotamus Conservation StatusPygmy Hippos are extremely rare in the wild \u2013 there is probably only a few thousand of them around.

Related female raccoons often share a common area, meeting at eating grounds or sleeping places. Male raccoons live together in small groups of around 4 individuals in order to maintain their positions against potential predators or invaders of the same kind, particularly during the mating season. Raccoons mark their territories using urine, faeces and glandular secretions, usually distributed with their anal glands.Raccoons have 13 identified vocal calls of which 7 are used in communication between mother and kits (young) one of these being a bird-like twittering.Raccoons are mischievous animals, however, they are quite intelligent as well. A study showed results that raccoons were able to open 11 of 13 complex locks in less than 10 tries and had no problems subsequently when the locks were rearranged or turned upside down. Raccoon also have very good memories.",
            "reproduction": "Raccoon breeding season occurs in spring between late January and mid march. After a gestation period of around 65 days, female raccoons give birth to 2 \u2013 5 young (kits). Kits measure 9.5 centimetres (3.7 inches) long and weigh between 60 and 75 grams (2.1 \u2013 2.6 ounces) at birth. The baby raccoon kits are blind and deaf at birth, though their mask already stands out on their light fur.They open their eyes for the first time after around 21 days. Once the kits weigh about 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds), they begin to explore outside of the den. They consume solid food for the first time after 6 to 9 weeks.Young raccoons are raised by their mothers until they disperse from the group in the autumn. Since some males show aggressive behaviour towards unrelated kits, mothers will isolate themselves from other raccoons until their kits are big enough to defend themselves. The life span of a raccoon in the wild is 1 \u2013 3 years, however, both wild and captive raccoons have been known to live up to 16 years.Road accidents are a common cause of death to raccoons. Predation by bobcats, coyotes and other predators is not a significant cause of death, especially because larger predators have been exterminated in many areas inhabited by raccoons.",

It is one of two extant species in the genus Nyctereutes, alongside the Japanese raccoon dog (N. viverrinus). This aniimal is actually much more closely related to the true fox rather than the American raccoon as its name suggests, but it is named so for the resemblance of its masked face to that of the common raccoon. There are four subspecies of the common raccoon dog \u2014 the Ussuri raccoon dog, the Yunnan raccoon dog, the Korean raccoon dog, and the Chinese raccoon dog, which is the nominate species. The scientific name \u201cNyctereutes procyonoides\u201d translates as \u201cnight wanderer\u201d in Greek \u2014 \u201cnykt\u201d (night) and \u201cereutes\u201d (wanderer).",
            "lifespan": "The raccoon dog has an average lifespan of between 6 and 11 years, with 6 to 7 years being the average.",
            "diet": "The raccoon dog is an omnivore that feeds on insects, rodents, amphibians, birds, fish, reptiles, mollusks, carrion, and insectivores, as well as fruits, nuts, and berries. Animals such as voles, gerbils, frogs and game birds are most commonly eaten. The raccoon dog can swim, so it can catch water dwelling animals easily, and will scoop prey out of the water using its paws near lakes, rivers, and streams. On the seashore, crabs, sea urchins, and sea carrion are also consumedThe raccoon dog will adapt their diet to the season. During the fall, they eat mainly vegetables, including a variety of fruits, wild berries, and seeds such as oats. In the winter, when food sources are limited, they may survive on human garbage and carrion.These animals rely on their sense of smell to forage for food because their eyesight is very poor. They forage on the ground or on low vegetation, and keep their noses low to the ground. They are not fast animals, but they are relentless in their search for food. They are typified as collectors or gatherers.",
            "behavior": "Raccoon dogs live and hunt in pairs or small family groups, but it is unknown whether they remain in the pairs in which they breed for life. Social grooming is important in raccoon dogs.They were originally thought to be nocturnal animals, but recent research has shown they may be active eat any time of the day or night. This is usually linked to the need for food.The raccoon dog hibernates from November and may extend through early April, depending on the local climate. These animals hibernate in pairs and are the only canids known to hibernate. They find an abandoned burrow created by a badger or another animal and use this for the hibernation period.Hibernation is not absolutely necessary for this species and some individuals may not hibernate at all. They must gain as much as 50% of their body weight before hibernation, otherwise they will have to emerge from the den on warm winter days to forage. If the weather is warm enough where they reside, such as in the southernmost part of the range, the raccoon dog won\u2019t hibernate.Raccoon dogs use latrines to communicate with other members of the species. A latrine is a definite site where an entire group of raccoon dogs will both urinate and defecate. They use these areas to not only communicate with family members, but also strangers.They are also vocal canids, although they do not bark. These animals whine, whimper, or mew and is usually a sign of friendly behavior. When being aggressive or if they are frightened, they may growl.",
            "reproduction": "Raccoon dogs breed at the end of the cold part of winter in January, February, or March, depending on geographic location, with females coming into heat once a year, after hibernation. Estrus lasts from 3 to 5 days and females release a scent to signal they are ready to mate.It is unknown whether raccoon dogs breed with the same partner year after year, although it is thought they are most likely monogamous in the wild. Polygamy has been reported in captive individuals though.Females are courted by 3 to 4 males during the mating season, but there is little fighting between males for mates. Pairs form strong bonds before mating and remain together until after their offspring have become independent. Both the males and females help to raise their pups.Males will bring the female food during her late pregnancy and, once the babies are weaned, the male typically watches over them while the female hunts for food. The male may also hunt while the female watches the young.The gestation period for the raccoon dog is between 59 and 64 days, after which 5 to 7 pups are born. Females give birth in dense vegetation or in burrows that have been abandoned by foxes or badgers.The pups are born blind and have soft, black fur, usually weighing between 60 to 115 g. They open their eyes at 9 or 10 days old and have teeth by around day 14 to 16. They are weaned between 30 and 40 days old. At 4 months, the pups begin learning how to hunt by watching their parents and by the time they are four and a half months old, they are ready to live on their own. The raccoon dog pups reach full size at 80 to 85 days of age and reach sexual maturity between 9 to 11 months.\u00a0Raccoon Dog Location and HabitatThe raccoon dog is native to eastern Siberia, northern China, North Vietnam, Korea, and Japan. However, between 1927 and 1957, the fur-farming industry introduced from 4,000 to 9,000 raccoon dogs to the European and Asian U.S.S.R. Therefore, today, this raccoon dog is found across northern and western Europe in countries including Finland, Sweden, Norway, Poland, Romania, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, France, Austria, and Hungary.The different subspecies are found in different countries and areas. The Chinese raccoon dog is found in Eastern China, while the Korean raccoon dog is found in the Korean Peninsula. The Yunnan raccoon dog is found in southeastern China and northern Vietnam, and the Ussuri raccoon dog is found in Russia Siberian Ussuri and Amur territories), northeastern China, North Korea, and was also introduced to Europe.They are found in both subarctic and subtropical climates and prefer forest, forest borders, or dense vegetation. These animals can also be found in regions bordering water, and altitudes greater than 3,000 m all the way down to sea level. They can also be found in human habitats if they are looking for food.The raccoon dog lives in burrows in areas of thick vegetation where they can hide and blend in with their environment. When food becomes scarce in their habitat, they will migrate to find a new territory where prey is more plentiful. They are adaptable and can move long distances to find a food source.\u00a0Raccoon Dog Conservation StatusRaccoon dogs are not considered to be an endangered animal and are listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Their total population is unknown.While they do have natural predators, they are killed mostly by humans. They are typically hunted from November until the snow deepens. In the Far East, they are hunted at night using Laikas and mongrels. They are also caught in traps set by poachers. Their fur is used on clothing and is often called \u201cmurmansky\u201d or \u201ctanuki\u201d fur. In the United States, it is marketed as \u201cAsiatic raccoon\u201d, and in Northern Europe as \u201cFinn raccoon\u201d.Pelts are used for necklets, collars, and fur coats. Small raccoon dog pelts with silky fur command higher prices than large, coarse-furred ones. Due to their long and coarse guard hairs and their woolly fur fibre, which has a tendency to felt or mat, raccoon dog pelts are used almost exclusively for fur trimmings.In Japan, people eat raccoon dogs as well as use their fur for bristles for calligraphy brushes. The bones have also been used medicinally and as an aphrodisiac. The natives also employed raccoon dog skin to make bellows, to decorate their drums, and for winter headgear.These animals are also bred in captivity for their fur. For example, twenty percent of domestically produced fur in Russia is from the raccoon dog.Raccoon dogs can cause harm to the ecosystem and human lifestyles. They to game bird populations, particularly in floodlands and the shorelines of estuaries, where they feed almost exclusively on eggs and chicks during the spring period. They are also harmful to the muskrat trade, destroying their nests and eating their young. In Ukraine, raccoon dogs are harmful to kitchen gardens, melon cultivations, vineyards, and corn seedlings.It can be considered a pest for these reasons, and can also transmit disease to pets and even humans. They are sometimes poisoned or shot if they enter these environments. They can be killed while trying to cross roads in busy areas as well.",
            "predators": "Raccoon dogs have a few natural predators, including wolves, wolverines, lynx, golden eagles, sea eagles, eagle owls, martens and even domestic dogs. They use their teeth and claws to protect themselves but are often much smaller than their predator and therefore cannot escape.This animal\u2019s brown coat allows it to blend in with its environment as a protection against predators. These mammals can also swim and climb trees to escape threats. The ability to climb trees is a characteristic they share with one other animal from the Canidae family, namely the gray fox.\u00a0"

The distinctive central tail feathers are tinged with blue and are longer in males than in females.The rainbow bee eater has yellow coloring on its breast and stomach and a golden crown. The throat is orange-yellow, with a broad black band separating it from a green breast.The rainbow bee eater has a black stripe extending through its red eyes from the base of the bill to the ears and is edged with a thin blue line. It has a black bill which is long, slender and curved and which is adapted for catching flying insects.",
            "habitat": "Rainbow Bee Eaters are most often found in open forests, woodlands and shrublands usually near water. They tend to avoid open desert areas. The bee eater will use disturbed sites such as quarries, cuttings and mines to build its nesting tunnels.",
            "diet": "Rainbow Bee Eaters, as the name suggests, mainly eat flying insects such as bees and wasps. They can spot a potential meal up to 150 feet away. Once the prey has been spotted, the bee eater swoops down from its high perch and snatches the insect in its long, slender bill. They will then fly back to their perch and bang the prey against the tree to subdue it.Bee eaters are immune to bee and wasp stings but will still remove the insects stinger while closing their eyes to avoid being squirted with the venom from stinging gland.Bee eaters can consume up to 700 bees in one day which makes them unpopular with beekeepers, however, this is generally balanced by their role in keeping pest insects such as locusts, hornets and wasps under control.",
            "behaviour": "Rainbow Bee Eaters are very sociable birds. Outside of the breeding season, they mainly roost in large groups in the dense undergrowth or in large trees. These small, colorful birds produce a soft \u2018prrp prrp\u2019 call when in flight.",
            "reproduction": "The Rainbow Bee Eaters breeding season occurs before or after the rainy season. These brilliantly colored birds are monogamous which means they pair for life.Both males and females select a suitable nesting site in a sandy bank. Nests are constructed by the female while the male brings her food such as insects. She will dig the burrow with her bill while balancing on her feet and wings and then balance on her bill while pushing loose soil backwards with her feet.The female digs around 3 inches deep per day, constricting a narrow tunnel which will lead to a nesting chamber. The length of the tunnel can average 89.4 centimetres (nearly 3 feet) in length and may be shared with other bee eater birds or even birds of other species.The female bee eater lays between 3 and 7 eggs which are white and glossy. The eggs are incubated for around 24 days by both parents until the chicks hatch. The young are fed by both parents and other birds in the group and will fledge after 28 \u2013 30 days. Hatchlings can fall victim to predators, particularly Cane Toads, Wild Dogs and Foxes.\u00a0",
            "conservation status": "The Rainbow Bee Eater is classed as \u2018Least Concern\u2019 by the IUCN. However, introduced predators such as wild dogs and foxes can dig down into the nests to prey up on nestlings."

The Ratels alternative name derives from the fact that it has a fondness for honey. Ratels are very fearless animals and have been entered into the Guinness Book of Records for this reason. There ferocity has made them one of the successful mammals in the animal world almost equalling a lion with its courage. A male ratel is called a Boar and a female is called a Sow.",
            "description": "Ratels are a similar size to the European Badger. They have a body length of 70 \u2013 120 centimetres and a tail length of 17 \u2013 30 centimetres. It measures 23 \u2013 30 centimetres at shoulder height. Weight can differ considerably between males and females with males ranging from 10 \u2013 14 kilograms and females 5 \u2013 12 kilograms. Ratels have muscular, compact bodies with well developed necks and shoulders.Ratels have a thick skull inside their broad heads, small eyes and no external ears. Their ears are enclosed in the skin, with an opening that can be closed to keep out dirt when the ratel is digging. They have a blunt snout and strong limbs equipped with long sharp claws which can measure 350 \u2013 400 millimetres in length and are used for digging. Their short legs have great endurance and they are able to chase large animals for long periods of time until the pursued become exhausted.Ratels have a very thick coat of fur that is silvery white on the upper parts and black on the lower parts. The top of its head is silvery white and resembles a cap on top of a black face. The ratel has anal glands with which it secretes a suffocating smell to mark its territory and to fumigate bee hives.",
            "habitat": "Ratels can be found on arid grasslands, moist savannas, montane forests and semi-deserts. They are adapted to surviving in both wet and dry habitats.",
            "diet": "Ratels are omnivores but have also been described as fierce carnivores. They are very good hunters, scavengers and forages. Their diet contains a wide variety of foods including fish, birds, reptiles \u2013 particularly snakes, invertebrates, insects, fruit and carrion. However, the ratels favourite food is honey. Ratels have been known to chase young lions away from their kills and steal their food.",
            "behaviour": "Ratels are nomadic creatures who are usually solitary or in small family groups. They range over massive areas with an adult ratels range being as large as 600 square kilometres. Ratels who live near human populations lead a completely nocturnal lifestyle, however, those in uninhabited regions are mainly diurnal.Ratels work in close partnership with a small bird called a Honey Guide.Honey Guides are very good at finding bees nests and ratels have a healthy appetite for bees nests. When the Honey Guide discovers a nest, which is usually in hollow trees or among rocks, it sings out loudly to inform the ratel. The bees nest consists of wax honeycombs which are full of honey and also bee grubs. Bee grubs develop from egg to pre-pupa before they diapause and hatch as adult bees.The ratel follows the bird to the nest where it then uses its strong claws to push away rocks or rips open tree trunks to reach the bees nest. The ratel then gets the honey and the Honey Guide gets the bee grubs and some of the honeycombs.There are risks in this behaviour whereby the ratel can sometimes be stung to death by the angry bees. However, ratels give off an awful smell which almost puts the bees to sleep so that they find it difficult to sting. The ratels thick coat also gives it plenty of protection against the stinging bees.Ratels often flush out small rodents by digging into their burrows when in need of a small meal. Ratels are very rarely preyed upon by other animals because of their ferocious nature and their thick, loose skin makes it difficult for a predator to grasp them. As well as being aggressive animals, ratels are actually very intelligent and have been observed using objects as tools to aid their hunting. The ratel has been seen rolling a log and positioning it to stand on in order to reach a Kingfisher bird which was obviously a potential meal.",
            "reproduction": "Male and female ratels mate for 3 \u2013 4 days inside a burrow. After a gestation period of 6 months, the female gives birth to 1 \u2013 4 cubs in a chamber or burrow lined with grass. The cubs look very much like their mother at birth and as they develop, they will learn how to be aggressive to other animals as they roam around the savannas and semi-deserts.The ratel cubs rely on their mother for food and shelter and as they travel, she will dig new burrows for the cubs to hide. Unfortunately, taking the cubs on hunts can hinder the adult ratels hunting and are therefore left in the burrow alone. This makes them vulnerable to predators and they can even be eaten by other ratels. Because of this, only 50% of ratel cubs will survive. Those who do survive go on to develop and learn hunting skills, how to climb trees and capture prey from its mother as cubs are not born with these essential survival skills.The lifespan of a ratel is 25 years in the wild.",
            "conservation status": "Ratels are classed as a \u2018Vulnerable\u2019 species. Because of the ratels low birth rate, they are very vulnerable to hunting and habitat destruction. They are also persecuted by bee hive farmers who believe they are a threat to their livelihood and many are killed or even stung to death after becoming caught in hive traps."

            "desc": "Rattlesnakes come in different varieties and there are numerous sub species and color variations. However, one characteristic that they do have in common is jointed rattles on their tail. Rattlesnakes are a group of venomous snakes, genera \u2018Crotalus\u2019 and \u2018Sistrurus\u2019. Rattlesnakes belong to the class of venomous snakes known commonly as \u2018pit vipers\u2019. There are nearly fifty species of rattlesnake, with numerous subspecies. Rattlesnakes are named for the rattle found at the tip of their tails that is used as a warning device when threatened. The rattlesnake has had a long affiliation with North America. It has been depicted for centuries along with the phrase \u2018dont tread on me\u2018 on the Gadsden Flag for a variety of political and patriotic reasons.",
            "rattlesnake characteristics": "The largest Rattlesnake is the Eastern Diamondback (Crotalus adamanteus) which grows up to 8 feet (2.4 metres) and weighs 4 to 10 pounds (1.8 to 4.5 kilograms). The smallest is the Ridge-nosed Rattlesnake (Crotalus willardi) at 12 inches (30.5 centimetres) long and weighing 3 to 4 ounces (85 to 113 grams). Most species of Rattlesnake are 24 to 48 inches (61 to 122 centimetres) long.Rattlesnakes have either a rattle or a partial rattle made of interlocking rings of keratin (the same material our fingernails are made of). When vibrated, the rattles create a rattling sound that warns off large hoofed animals or predators. Another unique characteristic is the \u2018pit\u2019 on each side of the head, a heat-sensitive organ for locating prey.Each time a Rattlesnake sheds its skin, a new rattle segment is added. Since Rattlesnakes may shed their skins several times a year depending on food supply and growth rates and since the rattle can and does break, there is little truth to the claim that one can tell a rattlesnakes age from the number of beads in its rattle. Newborn rattlesnakes do not have functional rattles. It is not until after they have shed their skin for the first time that they gain an additional bead. The new bead beats against the first bead, known as the \u2018button\u2019, to create the rattling sound. Adult snakes may lose their rattles on occasion, however, more appear at each molting. If the rattle absorbs enough water in wet weather, it will not make a noise.",
            "rattlesnake habitat": "Different species vary in color and behaviour with their habitat. Three examples of different species of Rattlesnake are:Red diamond rattlesnake (Crotalus exsul ruber) \u2013 San Diego\u2019s largest snake species may be found from San Bernardino and Riverside counties down into Baja California, Mexico. Red diamond rattlesnakes are common in areas with little development, especially near rocky outcroppings. Food consists of anything from small lizards to rabbits and squirrels.Southern Pacific Rattlesnake (Crotalus helleri) \u2013 Also called a western rattlesnake, this is the most common species and may be found near housing developments, parks and even the beach. The Southern Pacific Rattlesnakes range is from coastal Southern California to northwestern Baja California, Mexico, and they are commonly found on prairies or sage scrub/grassland areas, especially near rocky outcroppings. Like the red diamondback, the southern Pacific rattlesnake feeds mainly on reptiles and mammals, as well as birds.Southwestern speckled rattlesnake (Crotalus mitchelli pyrrhus) \u2013 This species is the least seen in Southern California because it tends to be shy and avoids populated areas. From the foothills of the Cuyamaca Mountains to the peaks and down into the deserts to the east, their preferred habitat is in granite rocky outcroppings. They can range into southern Nevada, western Arizona, and into northern Baja California.",
            "rattlesnake behaviour and diet": "Rattlesnakes tend to hunt at dusk. They begin to move and look for a good spot to ambush a mouse, rat, ground squirrel or rabbit. The Rattlesnakes forked tongue flicks in and out, picking up odour particles from the ground and passing them over a special smelling organ in the roof of the mouth, called the \u2018Jacobson\u2019s organ\u2019.The Rattlesnake lies in wait until its prey comes along. Even in total darkness, its prey will be visible to the snake. This is because the heat-sensitive pits on each side of the snakes head will detect the heat from the prey and nerves transmit this information to the same area in the brain that receives optic nerve impulses. It is accurate to say the rattlesnake can see a heat image of its prey and it can strike in darkness if the prey is even slightly warmer than its background. The rattlesnakes fangs inject venom into its prey. The species and habitat of the Rattlesnake determines how potent its venom is. After the strike, the snake flicks its forked tongue in and out, picking up odour particles from the ground to help it locate the trail of the dying prey in the dark.Rattlesnakes feed on rodents and other small animals, subduing them with a venomous bite as opposed to constricting. The venom stuns or kills typical rattlesnake prey immediately. A rattlesnake will follow prey that does not quickly succumb to the venom and attempts to escape. Rattlesnakes are especially known to strike at distances up to two-thirds their body length.Rattlesnakes are prey for kingsnakes, roadrunners, pig, hawks and eagles. Rattlesnakes have also been harvested as human food.",
            "rattlesnake reproduction": "Rattlesnakes do not lay eggs in nests. They actually give birth to live young. This type of reproduction is known as ovoviviparous. Female rattlesnakes only reproduce once every two years and carry the eggs inside their bodies for about 90 days. Young rattlesnakes are almost independent just minutes after they are born and in some species their venom is more toxic than the adults venom. At one to two weeks, they shed their skin and the first segment of their rattle is created (this happens each time they shed their skin).",
            "rattlesnake venom": "When a bite from a Rattlesnake occurs, the amount of venom injected cannot be gauged easily. Symptoms and swelling may occur quickly, however, in some cases hours may pass before serious effects appear.Quick medical attention is critical and treatment typically requires antivenin/antivenom to block the tissue destruction, nerve effects and blood-clotting disorders common with rattlesnake venom. Most medical experts recommend keeping the area of the bite below the level of the heart. It is important to keep a snake bite victim calm in order to avoid elevating their heart rate and accelerating the circulation of venom within the body."

            "redback spider habitat and webs": "Redback spider webs consist of a tangled, funnel-like upper retreat area from which vertical, sticky catching threads run to ground attachments. The Redback Spider favours proximity to human habitation, with webs being built in dry, sheltered sites, such as among rocks, in logs, shrubs, junk-piles, sheds, or toilets. Redback Spiders are less common in winter months. Daddy-long-legs Spiders and White-tailed Spiders are known to catch and kill Redback Spiders.",
            "redback spider diet": "Redback spiders usually prey on insects, however, they are capable of capturing quite large animals, such as male Trapdoor spiders, king crickets and small lizards, if they become entangled in their web. Prey-stealing is also common, with large females taking stored food items from other spiders webs.",
            "redback spider reproduction": "The Redback spider is one of only two animals where the male has been found to actively assist the female in sexual cannibalism. In the process of mating, the much smaller male somersaults to place his abdomen over the females mouthparts. In about 2 out of 3 cases, the female consumes the male while mating continues. Males who are not eaten die soon after mating.Once the female has mated, she can store sperm and use it over a period of up to 2 years to lay several batches of eggs. A female Spider may lay eggs every 25 to 30 days. A single female spider normally lays between 40 and 300 eggs in each sac, however, she can lay up to 5000 eggs. The eggs hatch 13 to 15 days after being laid. Young Redback Spiders leave the maternal web by being carried on the wind. The spider extends its abdomen high in the air and produces a droplet of silk. The liquid silk is drawn out into a long thread that, when long enough, carries the spider away. Eventually the silken thread will adhere to an object where the young spider will establish its own web.",
            "redback spider venom": "Redback spiders, along with Australasian funnel-web spiders (a category of spider which includes the notorious Atrax robustus, or Sydney funnel-web spider), are the most dangerous spiders in Australia. The redback spider has a neurotoxic venom which is toxic to humans with bites causing severe pain. Redback bites occur frequently, particularly over the summer months.Children, the elderly or those with serious medical conditions are at much higher risk of severe side-effects and death resulting from a bite.Common early symptoms of a Redback spider bite are pain (which can become severe), sweating (always including local sweating at bite site), muscular weakness, nausea and vomiting. Antivenom is available. No deaths have occurred since its introduction.The larger female spider is responsible for almost all cases of Redback spider bites in humans, the smaller male spider was thought to be unable to envenom a human. However, male bites have occurred; the rarity of bites is probably due to his smaller size and its proportionally smaller fangs, rather than the male being incapable of biting or lacking venom of similar potency of the female. Cases have shown that the male bite usually only produces short-lived, mild pain."

            "desc": "The Red Squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) is a species of the tree squirrels. Red squirrels are tree-dwelling omnivorous rodents that are frequently found throughout Eurasia. In Britain, however, numbers have decreased drastically due to the introduction of the eastern Grey Squirrel from North America. Red squirrels have a head to body length of 19 to 23 centimetres and a tail length of 15 to 20 centimetres. Red squirrels are not sexually dimorphic as male Red squirrels and female Red squirrels are the same size. The red squirrel is slightly smaller than the eastern grey squirrel which has a head to body length of 25 to 30 centimetres and weighs between 400 and 800 grams. It is thought that the long tail helps the squirrel to balance and steer when jumping from tree to tree and running along branches and may keep the animal warm during sleep. The coat of the red squirrel varies in color according to the time of year and location. There are several different coat color morphs ranging from black to red. Red coats are most common in Great Britain. The underside of the squirrel is always white-cream in color. Red squirrels shed their coats twice a year, switching from a thinner summer coat to a thicker, darker winter coat with noticeably larger ear-tufts between August and November. A lighter, redder overall coat color, along with the larger ear-tufts, helps to distinguish the European red squirrel from either of the Eastern Grey Squirrel or the American Red Squirrel."

            "desc": "The Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) is a member of the Canidae family and is a part of the order Carnivora within the class of mammals. Members of the family are called \u2018canids\u2019 and include dogs, wolves, foxes, coyotes, dingoes, jackals and African Wild Dogs. The Red fox is the most widely distributed and populous canid in the world, having colonised large parts of Europe, America, Asia and Africa. In the British Isles, where there are no longer any other native wild canids, it is referred to simply as \u2018the fox\u2019. The Red Fox pre-breeding season population is estimated to be 258,000.",
            "description": "As the name suggests, red foxes have rusty reddish-brown fur. This can vary in coloration and can give rise to black, silver or cross morphs. Their long, bushy tail, known as a \u2018brush\u2019 or \u2018sweep\u2019 is often tipped with white fur and the backs of the ears are black, as are part of the legs. They have white underparts.During the autumn and winter, the Red Fox will grow more fur. This so called \u2018winter fur\u2019 keeps the animal warm in colder environments. The fox sheds this fur at the beginning of spring, reverting back to the short fur for the duration of the summer.Although foxes are the smallest members of the dog family, the largest species of Red fox may reach an adult weight of 3 \u2013 11 kilograms (6.5 \u2013 24 pounds). The average head and body length is 18 to 33.75 inches (46 to 86 centimetres), with a tail length of 12 to 21 inches (30.5 to 55 centimetres). The size of a fox can be estimated from their tracks. Red fox footprints are normally about 4.4 centimetres wide and 5.7 centimetres long. A normal trotting stride is about 33 \u2013 38 centimetres. Size can vary from country to country, foxes living in Canada and Alaska tend to be larger than foxes in the Britain, which are in turn larger than those inhabiting the Southern United States.The fox has a slender muzzle, with white fur on the top lip and some individuals have black tear marks. Their chest is often white.Foxes have strong legs which allow them to reach speeds of approximately 48 kilometres per hour (30 miles per hour), a great benefit to catching prey or escaping from predators.The spacing between the canine teeth of a fox is approximately 18 to 25 millimetres apart. Foxes lack the facial muscles necessary to bare their teeth, unlike most other canids.",
            "habitats": "The fox is a remarkably resourceful creature, able to cope in a very wide range of different environmental conditions, from sub-tropical regions to icy tundra, the red fox is able to find food and keep warm. Foxes inhabit almost every habitat \u2013 sea cliffs, sand dunes, salt marshes, peat bogs, high mountains, woodland and particularly abundant in urban areas.They make \u2018lairs\u2019 in a foxes \u2018earth\u2019, under tree trunks, in hollow trees, in bracken or in deserted buzzard nests.",
            "diet": "Red foxes are mainly carnivores but are generally classed as omnivores. In Britain, the red fox feeds mainly on small rodents such as field mice, voles and rabbits, however, they will also eat birds, insects, earthworms, grasshoppers, beetles, blackberries, plums and mollusks and crayfish, amphibians, small reptiles and fish. almost anything it finds, often eating carrion (dead animal carcass) or preying on new-born lambs in the spring. Foxes have also been known to kill deer fawns.Foxes typically eat 0.5 \u2013 1 kilograms (1 \u2013 2 pounds) of food a day. With their acute sense of hearing, they can locate small mammals in thick grass and they are able to jump high in the air to pounce on the prey. This resourcefulness is one of the main reasons they have been able to populate our towns and cities with great success.Foxes are superb hunters, able to sprint, turn and jump with surprising ease for a dog. Surplus food is buried, they typically store the food in shallow holes (5 \u2013 10 centimetres deep). This is thought to prevent the loss of their entire food supply in the event that another animal finds the store.",
            "behaviour": "Living as it does in a wide variety of habitats, the fox displays a wide variety of behaviours. Two populations of the fox may be as different as two different species in their behaviour.The Red Fox is primarily crepuscular with a tendency to becoming nocturnal in areas of great human interference, this means it is most active at night and at twilight. Foxes are generally solitary hunters, foraging alone in the summer, however, they very occasionally group together in a pack. In general, each fox claims its own territory and it pairs up only in winter. Territories may be as large as 50 kilometres squared (19 square miles), however, in habitats with abundant food sources, ranges are much smaller, less than 12 kilometres squared (4.6 square miles).Several dens are utilized within these territories. Dens may be newly dug out or claimed from previous residents such as marmots. A larger main den is used for winter living, birthing and rearing of young, whereas smaller dens are dispersed throughout the territory for emergency and food storage purposes.A series of tunnels often connects them with the main den. One fox may only need a square kilometre of land marked by recognition posts that are special smells that come from a scent gland located just above their tail.Socially, the fox communicates with body language and a variety of vocalizations. Its vocal range is quite large and its noises vary from a distinctive three-yip \u2018lost call\u2019 to a shriek reminiscent of a human scream. It also communicates with scent, marking food and territorial boundary lines with urine and faeces.",
            "reproduction": "The mating season is December to February when the female fox (vixen) can be heard at night uttering her eerie, high pitched scream. The Foxes primarily form monogamous pairs each winter. The pair stay together to act as parents to the new born kits (cubs or pups) after a gestation period of between 51 and 53 days.A litter of 4 \u2013 6 kits are produced each year, however, litters may be as large as 13. Kits are born blind and may weigh as much as 150 grams (0.33 pounds). The female fox stays with them in a den called the \u2018earth\u2019 for two weeks and are fed by the male fox.The kits eyes are open by 2 weeks and the kits have taken their first exploratory steps out of the den by 5 weeks, by 10 weeks they are fully weaned. They remain with their mother until Autumn when they disperse at approximately 8 \u2013 10 months old to find territories and mates of their own.The Red Fox reaches sexual maturity by 10 months of age and may live for 12 \u2013 18 years in urban areas but will usually only live 3 years in the wild.Red foxes are sometimes used in the breeding of the Canadian Marble Fox, which only exists as a result of selective breeding.",
            "conservation status": "The fox is not under threat in any of its range due to the ability to cope well around humans. They are not considered to be endangered and are the most widespread and abundant wild carnivore in the world.Foxes are considered a pest by many farmers although it is difficult to judge their impact on the land, they do provide a service in keeping rabbit and rat numbers in check and are thought to only go after ill and dead lambs. The banning of fox hunting in the UK could actually bring a downturn in foxes due to the potential for increasing numbers being shot or poisoned as hunting never took a major toll on numbers.Red Foxes are generally considered to be the most serious predator of free range poultry. The safest option known in poultry protection is to keep the flock and the fox physically separated, usually with fencing. A fence needs to be at least 2 metres high in order to keep out most foxes, though on some rare occasions, a determined fox might succeed in climbing over. Surplus killing will often occur in enclosed spaces such as huts, with discarded feathers and headless bodies usually being the main indicators of fox predation.",

It is found across mainland Australia but avoids more fertile areas in the south, east coast and northern rainforests. Red Kangaroos are marsupials, a type of mammal that gives birth to underdeveloped young (joeys). Males are called \u2018Boomers\u2019 and females are called \u2018Flyers\u2019.",
            "description": "Red Kangaroos are very large animals. Males can grow up to 1.4 metres (4.6 feet) in body length and weigh up to 85 kilograms (187.4 pounds). Females measure 1.1 metres (3.6 feet) in length and weigh 35 kilograms (77.2 pounds).Red Kangaroos have very long tails which can measure 0.9 metres (3 feet) in length. Male red kangaroos have short, reddish brown fur with a more faded coloring below and on their limbs. They have a square shaped muzzle and long, pointed ears. Females are smaller than males and their coats are a pale grey color with a blue tinge, females are sometimes called \u2018blue fliers\u2019.Females have a pocket of skin called a pouch on the lower part of their stomach to carry their young. Red kangaroos have short forelimbs with small claws on the end. Their hind limbs are long and muscular and used for jumping. Some jumps can travel up to 16 feet (5 metres) in one leap. Red kangaroos have strong tails that are sometimes used to create a tripod when standing upright.The Red Kangaroo maintains its internal temperature at a point of homeostasis (about 36\u00b0C) using a variety of physical, physiological and behavioural adaptations. These include having an insulating layer of fur, being less active and staying in the shade when temperatures are high where it will pant, sweat and lick its forelimbs.The Red Kangaroos range of vision is approximately 300 degrees due to the position of its eyes. A humans range of vision is around 180 degrees in comparison.",
            "habitat": "The Red Kangaroo inhabits most of the dry inland of the central part of Australia in small groups called mobs. It prefers open plains where trees and bushes are scarce.",
            "diet": "Kangaroos are herbivores. The diet of the Red Kangaroo consists of grasses and other vegetation. Red kangaroos can survive long periods of time without water. Their thirst is satisfied by the moisture taking from the plants that they consume.",
            "behaviour": "The Red Kangaroo either lives alone or in small groups. They are mainly active in the evening or night (nocturnal and crepuscular) when it is cooler and spend most of the day sleeping. Kangaroos are not territorial animals and only enter into conflict over females. The largest males are dominant and control most of the breeding.When male kangaroos fight over potential mates, they appear to be boxing. When fighting, male kangaroos balance on their strong tails, grab their rival with their forearms and kick with their powerful hind legs. They attempt to push their opponent off balance. Kangaroos can also bite and wield sharp claws, which they may do in battle with an enemy like a dingo.Red kangaroos hop around at great speeds which can reach over 35 miles per hour (56 kilometres an hour). When grazing together they are always on the lookout for danger and will warn others in the group by stamping their feet. This is a sign for young joeys to hop back into their mother\u2019s pouch for safety.",
            "reproduction": "Red Kangaroos have no specific breeding season and breed all year round. The females have the unique ability to delay birth of their baby until their previous Joey has left the pouch. This is called \u2019embryonic diapause\u2019. The gestation period is around 33 days. Females have one young at a time. The young are extremely small, about 2 centimetres, the size of a cherry. Joeys are born blind and have no fur. The joey will suckle on one of the females 4 teats continuously for the first 4 months of its life.Once the joey has grown fur, it will leave the pouch on small exploring trips. As the joey grows, their heads and feet can be seen hanging out of the pouch. The young Joey will permanently leave the pouch at around 235 days old, but will continue to suckle until it reaches 12 months of age. The life span of the Red Kangaroo is 23 years in the wild.",
            "conservation status": "Red Kangaroos are classed as \u2018Least Concern\u2019 by the IUCN. In Australia, the Red Kangaroos numbers have increased in numbers in response to the people. Sheep ranchers have converted woodlands to grasslands and provided permanent water sources and have also helped by fencing out and killing the dingo. However, many millions of kangaroos roam Australia, and considerable numbers are killed each year for their skins and meat, which is becoming a more popular human food."

During summers, the red panda may feed on fruits, mushrooms, leaves, grasses, roots, fruits, lichens and acorns. Although considered herbivorous, the red panda will occasionally take birds eggs and it is speculated that they may eat mice and birds on occasions. Because the nutrient level of bamboo is so low, the Red panda has a slow metabolism and spends a good part of its day foraging.The Red pandas digestive system is also like the digestive system of the giant panda. The Red panda is more suited to a carnivorous diet. However, it cannot digest cellulose, so it must consume a large volume of bamboo to survive and is therefore classed as mostly herbivorous.",
            "social behaviour": "The Red panda is nocturnal and is mostly active in the early morning and late afternoon spending most of the day resting in trees conserving their energy as their bamboo diet has a low energy content. Red pandas are normally solitary creatures, however, they form pairs in the breeding season.Red pandas appear to be territorial. Red pandas use glandular sacs in their anal regions which produce a scent which they use to mark territorial boundaries by rubbing their sacs on various objects in the wild. Additionally, they may also mark territory by using regular defecation sites. Red pandas have a mild, non-aggressive disposition.",
            "reproduction": "The gestation period of the female red panda is about 3 months. During this time, the female will make a nest out of grass and twigs in either a hollow tree or rock crevasse. Up to 3 newborn cubs are then delivered into the nest. Breeding season occurs from mid-January to early March and cubs are usually born between mid-May and mid-July. Red pandas reach sexual maturity around a year old.Newborn red panda cubs weigh around 4 \u2013 5 ounces. They are fully furred and pale yellow in color. Just like Giant Panda cubs, they are blind at birth and rely totally on their mother for care and survival. When the cubs are 3 weeks old, they open their eyes. Red panda cubs start to take on the adult red panda coloration at about 90 days old. Red panda cubs are weaned at 5 months and stay with their mother until the next litter is about to be born, which is about a year after their birth.Male red pandas do not share the raising of the cubs, it is completely left to the mother red panda to raise and care for the cubs herself. Red pandas can live up to 14 years in captivity. It is not sure, however, how long they actually live in the wild.",

They are omnivorous and feed mostly on plant materials. This bird nests in loose colonies and is very territorial. The red-winged blackbird is thought to be the most abundant living land bird in North America, with records showing that breeding pairs across North and Central America may exceed 250 million in peak years. Because of this, they are listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.",
            "red-winged blackbird lifespan": "On average the red-winged blackbird does not have a very long lifespan, and usually only lives for around 2 years. However, the oldest recorded red winged blackbird in the wild lived to be over 15 years old, and may of these birds do live over the age of 10.\u00a0",
            "diet": "The red winged blackbird species is an omnivore that will feed on whatever they can find. They primarily feed on seeds and agricultural products, such as corn and rice, particularly in the non-breeding season. In season, blueberries, blackberries and other fruits are consumed, too.However, mostly in the breeding season, these bicolored blackbirds will also feed on animal material such as snails, frogs, fledgling birds, eggs, carrion, worms, dragonflies, butterflies, moths, true flies and arachnids.These birds forage for insects by picking them from plants, particularly the base of aquatic plants, or by catching them in flight.\u00a0",
            "behavior": "The red winged blackbird is a social bird, that roosts in large population and will often migrate in large flocks of a thousand or more. These birds are largely diurnal, spending most of their day foraging.They perch in trees, bushes, fences and telephone lines while looking for their food. Their way of flying is characteristic, with rapid wing flaps punctuated by brief periods of gliding flight.Red winged blackbirds do not really fight, although males of the species have been known to.\u00a0",

Males will defend their territory against other male red-winged blackbirds and also against other species of bird.They will also swoop at humans that get too close to their nest.The home range and territory size of the red-winged blackbird can vary greatly depending on the location and subspecies. Males usually control territories of approximately 2,000 square meters. Females occupy a territory with a single male along with many other females.\u00a0",

They both use distress and alarm calls which differ with the nature of the threat, and short-contact calls are also common. Threat calls are also used to ward off predators.Only males produce flight calls, which signal their exit from the territory.These birds also use visual displays for communication, especially before and during mating. Males will use these displays to attract females and also to defend their territory from other males.\u00a0",
            "red-winged blackbird reproduction": "Red winged blackbirds breed from the end of April to the end of July and nest in loose colonies. These birds are polygynous, with territorial males defending up to 10 females. However, females frequently copulate with males other than their social mate and often lay clutches of mixed paternity.Mating rituals begin with the song of the male. The displays from the males include vocalization in a crouched position with rapid and highly conspicuous fluttering of the wings. Females often do not return songs until they have established themselves in the territory of a male. The female responds with a similar crouch and vocalization when ready.They build their nests in cattails, rushes, grasses, sedge, or alder or willow bushes. They are made with grasses, sedge, and mosses, lined with mud, and bound to surrounding grasses or branches, usually positioned 7.6 cm (3.0 in) to 4.3 m (14 ft) above water. The nest is constructed entirely by the female over the course of three to six days.Females lay a clutch of three of four (rarely five) eggs, which are oval, smooth and slightly glossy in appearance and measure 24.8 mm x 17.55 mm (0.976 in x 0.691 in). They are usually pale bluish green, marked with brown, purple, and/or black.The female incubates the egg alone for 11 to 12 days, after which the eggs are hatched. When born, the young red-winged blackbirds are blind and without feathers. Nestlings are fed almost immediately after hatching with small arthropods, such as dragonflies, moths and butterflies.The nestlings are fed primarily by the female although the male will take part in the feeding process at times. The young are ready to leave the nest 11 to 14 days after hatching.Pairs raise two or three clutches per season, with a new nest for each clutch. The juveniles usually reach sexual maturity in 2 to 3 years and females reproduce for up to ten years.\u00a0Red-winged Blackbird Location and HabitatThe red-winged blackbird is widely spread throughout North America, except in the arid desert, high mountain ranges, and arctic regions. They breed from central-eastern Alaska and Yukon in the northwest, Newfoundland in the northeast, northern Costa Rica in the south, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific.They can generally be found in open grassy areas, preferring wetlands. The red-winged blackbird inhabits both freshwater and saltwater marshes, but can also be found in dry upland areas, such as in meadows, prairies, lightly wooded deciduous forests and fields. In winter red-winged blackbirds are most often found in open fields and croplands.\u00a0",
            "red-winged blackbird migration": "The winter ranges for red-winged blackbirds vary by geographic location. Red-winged blackbirds that breed in the northern part of their range, i.e., Canada and border states in the United States, migrate to southern United States and Central America beginning in September or October (or occasionally as early as August) for the winter.However, populations near the Pacific and Gulf coasts of North America and those of Middle America are not migrants; they are year-round resident and spend the winter in their breeding ranges.\u00a0Red-winged Blackbird Conservation StatusThe red winged blackbird is one of the most common, widespread and abundant birds across North America. They are listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.They can survive in an array of habitats, which means they can overcome habitat loss well. Because of this, they are not really protected across their range from the effects of habitat loss and urbanization. Despite their ability to adapt, it is thought in the near future these birds will begin to suffer with the loss of wetland areas.\u00a0",
            "red winged blackbird predators": "Predators of the red-winged blackbird can vary based on location. The main predators of this bird species include racoons, owls, short-tailed hawks, red-tailed hawks, American mink, long-tailed weasels, common grackles, Eurasian magpies, and snakes.Ravens and grazers such as marsh wrens feed on eggs and young chicks, but only when the nest is left unattended. To prevent creation on eggs and chicks, red-winged blackbirds nest in groups, and also nest over water. They also nest high in dense riparian reeds, at a height of one or two meters, to avoid being seen.\u00a0",
            "red winged blackbird importance": "Because the red-winged blackbird is a forager, it is very important to its ecosystem. These birds help to control insect populations, and help plants and crops grow by feeding on weeds. They eat pests which can harm cotton and alfalfa crops. They help to disperse seeds throughout their range, too. They can also be an important source of food for animals such as raccoons and mink.Unfortunately, because these birds flock and roost in such large numbers, their ecosystem can also be affected in a negative. In some areas, they can appear to \u201ctake over\u201d when migrating or nesting because they travel in very big groups. These birds can also devastate farm fields, leading to a loss of income for farmers. Because of this, farmers sometimes illegal poison these birds by using pesticides.\u00a0Red Winged Blackbird FAQsWhere are red winged blackbirds in the world?Red-winged blackbirds are found all throughout North America. They range extends from southern Alaska at its northern most point, to the Yucatan peninsula in the south and covers the greater part of the continent from the Pacific coast of California and Canada to the eastern coast.What do red winged blackbirds eat?Red-winged blackbirds will feed on whatever they can find, although they mainly eat plant materials such as seeds, as well as animal material like snails, frogs, eggs, worms, dragonflies, butterflies and moths.Are red winged blackbirds migratory?Some-red winged blackbirds are migratory. Those that reside in the northern part of theor range are migratory, and spend their winters in the southern United States and Central America. In western and Central America, the populations are generally non-migratory.Do red winged blackbirds have red wings?Not exactly. Male red winged blackbirds are black all over and have a red shoulder and yellow wing bar. These red wing patches that give the bird its common name are most visible when the bird is flying or displaying. Female red-winged blackbirds, on the other hand, are mostly brown all over.How many types of red winged blackbird are there?There are between 20 and 24 subspecies of red winged blackbird found throughout North America.\u00a0"

            "desc": "The Red Wolf (Canis Rufus) is the rarest and most endangered of all the wolf species. It is thought that the Red Wolfs original distribution included much of eastern North America, where Red Wolves were found from Pennsylvania in the east, Florida in the south and Texas in the west. On the basis of further study, the Red Wolfs historic range is now thought to have extended further north into the northeastern USA and extreme eastern Canada. In the last century, however, persecution, habitat destruction and hybridizations with Coyotes have brought the Red Wolf to the brink of extinction.",
            "characteristics": "The Red Wolf is a medium-sized canid, smaller and more slender than the Grey Wolf, however, the Red Wolf is larger than the coyote. Adult male Red Wolves typically has a height at the shoulder of 38 \u2013 40 centimetres (15 \u2013 16 inches), a length of 140 \u2013 165 centimetres (4.5 \u2013 5.5 feet) and weighs 18 \u2013 36 kilograms (40 \u2013 80 pounds). The Red wolf has a smooth reddish coat, silver-grey forehead, darker marks on white legs and a cream colored underbelly. The Red Wolf has long ears and long legs.",
            "population": "Red Wolves were almost hunted to the brink of extinction in 1980. Fewer than 20 pure red wolves were gathered up by and American organisation called the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to be bred in captivity. Although they were declared extinct in the wild in 1980, fortunately there were enough captive animals by 1987 to begin a reintroduction program.Today, approximately 155 captive red wolves reside at 37 captive breeding facilities across the US, including two island programs. Thanks to these programs, nearly 100 red wolves currently live in the wild, including 68 wolves that have been outfitted with radio collars.",
            "reproduction": "Red Wolves tend to pair off with a mate for life. Once bonded, they breed once a year, usually in late winter. Gestation period is between 60 and 63 days. After this time, the female gives birth to between 2 \u2013 6 pups. Both parents help raise the offspring who are mature enough to leave behind parental support at 6 months of age. Red Wolves in captivity can live up to 15 years old, however, there life span in the wild is somewhat shorter averaging around 6 \u2013 7 years.",
            "diet": "Unlike the Grey Wolf, the Red Wolf eats mainly small animals including rabbits, raccoons and rodents. Red Wolves will occasionally eat insects and berries. Because they are smaller than the Grey Wolf, large prey is difficult to capture and therefore it is rare for them to eat larger prey such as deer unless they have help from other wolves.",
            "behaviour": "Red Wolves are shy and secretive animals and tend to hunt alone or in small packs that include the breeding adult pair (the alpha male and female) and their offspring. Size of the pack varies with the size depending on the availability of prey.A hierarchy of dominant and subordinate animals within the pack help it to function as a unit. Red wolves are primarily nocturnal and mainly active at night. They communicate by scent marking, vocalizations (including howling), facial expressions and body postures. . (For more information see Wolf Behaviour).",
            "range": "Historically, Red Wolves ranged throughout the southeastern United States from Pennsylvania to Florida and as far west as Texas. Today, the only wild red wolves roam the Alligator River Refuge and nearby Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge in northeastern North Carolina.",
            "habitats": "Habitats for the wild Red Wolf include forests, wetlands, coastal prairies and mountains. Red Wolves make their dens in hollow trees, stream banks and in sand knolls.",
            "": "Threats to the Red Wolf include habitat loss because of human development and negative attitudes that hinder restoration. The main threat to the species survival is hybridizations with coyotes. In recent years the Red Wolf has declined and been replaced over most of its range by Coyotes and Coyote-Red Wolf hybrids.\u00a0Red Wolf Conservation StatusIn 1987 approximately 100 were reintroduced into the wild as the 1st island propagation project in the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge off the coast of North Carolina. In 1989 the 2nd island propagation project initiated with release of a population on Horn Island of the Mississippi coast. This population was moved in 1998 because of a likelihood of encounters with humans.The 3rd island propagation project introduced a population on St. Vincent Island, Florida offshore between Cape San Blas and Apalachicola, Florida in 1990 and in 1997 the 4th island propagation program introduced a population to Cape St. George Island, Florida south of Apalachicola, Florida.

Female Reticulated Giraffes measure up to 17 feet tall and weigh between 1540 and 2600 pounds. A lot of this height and weight is because of the giraffes incredibly long neck, which can be 8 feet in length and can weigh almost 500 pounds.Even though the Reticulated Giraffes neck is taller than most humans are, it is still made of only 7 bones. This is the same number of bones that are in the human neck. On the top of their heads, Reticulated Giraffes have horns made of solid bone and covered with skin. These are used for sparring between males.Reticulated Giraffes are also fast and are able to gallop up to 56 kilometres per hour (35 miles per hour). Mothers aggressively defend their calves, kicking out with their feet at the approach of lions or hyenas.",
            "diet": "The extraordinary height of the Reticulated Giraffe allows them to browse on branches of trees that other hoofed animals cannot reach. This has helped make the Reticulated Giraffe one of the most successful animals of the African savannah. The Reticulated Giraffe feeds mainly on Acacia and Combretum trees, however, it will eat as many as 100 different plants depending on which are available at the time.Since Reticulated Giraffes have such long necks, they can reach a 6 foot band of foliage that is above the reach of all other animals except the elephant. The Reticulated Giraffe will use its upper lip and long tongue to strip the leaves, shoots, flowers and vines from the trees. The Reticulated Giraffe needs 75 pounds per day of vegetation. However, it only drinks water every 2 to 3 days when it is available and can go for weeks without drinking any water at all.The Reticulated Giraffe gets a large amount of water from the dew on the leaves and from the water in the leaves.

Grey or brown in color, these animals are unique in their appearance. Rhinoceroses belong to the family Rhinocerotidae and belong to the order Perissodactyla, (perissodactls) which means \u2018odd toed ungulates\u2019. \u2018Odd toed ungulates\u2019 are animals that have hoofs but have a reduced number of toes (usually 3 toes). Rhinoceroses carry their main weight on the middle toe of each foot. Horses and zebras are also members of this species, however, they are divided up again into sub-orders as you can see below: Perissodactyls are divided into 2 suborders, 3 families and 15 species which include: Sub-order Ceratomorpha: Family Tapiridae \u2013 tapirs, Family Rhinocerotidae \u2013 rhinoceroses",
            "horns": "Black rhinos, white rhinos and Sumatran rhinos have two horns, while Javan rhinos and Indian rhinos have one. Rhinos horns are made of keratin, which is the same material that makes up our fingernails and hair.These horns do not have a bony core like other mammal horns have and CT scans have shown dense mineral deposits of calcium and melanin in the core of the horn. This means that they are pretty soft and can be worn down or sharpened after years of use. If a horn breaks off, it can gradually grow back.Rhino horns tend to curve backwards towards the head because the keratin in front grows faster than the keratin in the backBlack and white rhinos grow the longest horns, with black rhinos typically grow longer horns than other rhino species. Their front horn can grow to 20 to 51 inches (51 to 130 cm), while the rear horn can grow to about 20 inches. Sumatran rhino horns grow to about 10 to 31 inches (25 to 79 cm) in the front and less than 3 inches (7 cm) in the rear. The greater one horned rhino\u2019s horn is 8 to 24 inches (20 to 61 cm), and Javan rhinos have a horn that is about 10 inches (25 cm) long. Female Javan rhinos either do not have a horn or they have just a stubby knob in its place.",
            "lifespan": "The rhino has a lifespan of between 35 and 50 years.",
            "diet": "Rhinos are herbivores and spend the morning, late afternoon and nighttime eating, while the spend the hottest part of the day resting. The type of vegetation they eat varies by species, which is because their snouts are different shapes to accommodate different types of food.Rhinos fall into one of two categories when it comes to dietary habits \u2014 grazers and browsers. Grazers primarily feed on grasses with a preference for shorter grasses, while browsers focus their attention on food that\u2019s above eye level \u2014 with preferences including twigs, fruit, and leaves.For example, the black rhino, a browser, eats trees or bushes because its long lips allow it to pick leaves and fruit from up high. The white rhino, a grazer, has a flat-shaped snout that lets it get closer to the ground for eating grass.Black and white rhinos share Africa\u2019s savanna habitats, as they don\u2019t compete for food. Black rhinos can go for up to five days without drinking water, getting needed moisture from succulent plants. White rhinos crop grasses so short when they graze in their habitat that they create \u201cgrazing lawns\u201d that benefit smaller herbivores and serve as firebreaks.In captivity, rhinos are typically fed on a diet of alfalfa and soy. Unfortunately, it could be this diet that is responsible for infertility in female rhinos in captivity.",
            "behavior": "Most rhinos are solitary animals. Black rhinos will aggressively defend their territory, and Sumatran rhinos are known to mark their trails with feces and urine. The Indian Rhinoceros (greater one horned rhino) and the Javan rhino have a more loosely defined territory, and their territories may overlap. Rhinos use their horns to defend their territory and fights amongst rhinos can lead to death. In fact, 50 percent of black rhino bulls and 30 percent of females die from wounds received during a fight, which is the highest rate for any mammal.Male rhinos, known as bulls, occupy a small territory and they may allow one or two subordinate males to share the territory with him. Neighboring bulls show respect and will not enter this territory unless water is needed during the dry season.The white rhino is the most social of all the rhino species, with groups of around a dozen rhinos forming. These groups will usually be made up of mothers and calves, as calves will be more protected in a larger group. A group of rhinos is called a \u201ccrash\u201d.While rhinos may look indestructible, their skin is actually quite sensitive, especially to sunburn and biting insects. Their blood vessels are close to the skin\u2019s surface, which mean they can be easily scarred. This is why wallowing is so important to their everyday behavior \u2014 they cover themselves in mud to cool themselves down and to protect themselves from the sun\u2019s rays. Rhinos may even share a wallowing spot without any fighting.Because of their bad eyesight, rhinos rely on the alarm calls of a bird called the oxpecker. These birds hop onto a rhino\u2019s back, plucking ticks and other parasites off the rhino\u2019s skin, even entering the ears and nostrils to get rid of them. They also make a loud sound when there is potential danger for the rhino nearby.Rhinos use sounds to communicate. Long and short snorts are used for anger, alarm, or when the rhino is startled, and high-pitched screams indicate fear. When rhinos are happy, they make a loud \u201cmmwonk\u201d sound with their mouths.",
            "reproduction": "Females choose males to mate with by showing up to their territory when they are ready to mate. The bull approaches the female with a series of \u201chic-pants,\u201d which is a breathy inhalation followed by a hiccup. He may rest his chin on her rump to test whether she will tolerate a mating, too.Females reproduce every two and a half to five years. The gestation period for a rhino is 15 to 16 months, and they usually give birth to just one offspring. Twins are rare. Baby rhinos, called calves, will weigh around 88 to 140 lbs (40 to 64 kg).A newborn calf is able to stand relatively soon after birth, although they will be wobbly on their feet. They begin to nurse two to three hours after birth and will continue until they are 12 to 18 months of age, although male claves will nurse for longer as they grow much larger as adults. They begin to eat solid food at 7 to 10 days of age. Rhinos will stay with their mother until they are around three years old, but may be pushed out earlier if their mother has another baby.\u00a0Habitat and LocationRhinos live in Africa and Asia. The white and black rhinos live in the grasslands and floodplains of eastern and southern Africa, while the Indian rhino, the Sumatran rhino and the Javan rhino live in Asia. The three Asian rhinos species can be found in the swamps and rainforests, which means all Asian rhinos are excellent swimmers.The black rhino favors open woodlands, while the greater one horned rhino likes forests and the tall grasslands. The Javan rhino prefers dense rainforests, tall grasses and reed beds, while the Sumatran rhino lives at the highest elevation of all the rhino species.\u00a0Conservation StatusRhinos of all species are in danger of becoming extinct. According to International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s (IUCN\u2019s) Red List of Threatened Species, black rhinos, Sumatran rhinos and Javan rhinos are \u201ccritically endangered\u201d, greater one horned rhinos (also known as the Indian Rhino) are \u201cvulnerable\u201d and white rhinos are \u201cnear threatened\u201d. In fact, there are now only two northern white rhinos left in the world, both living in captivity, according to the World Wildlife Fund.The Sumatran rhinos and Javan rhinos are two of the most critically endangered large mammals in the world. The Javan rhino is the rarest of the rhinos, with none living in zoos. It is thought there are fewer than 50 Javan rhinos in the wild, although they have only been counted with a sensor camera and little is known about the species. The Sumatran rhino is also critically endangered, with less than 80 individuals left in the wild. Because there are so few of this species left, isolation is another threat \u2014 they are simply too scattered to find mates to breed. While Sumatran rhinos have been brought to zoos for breeding purposes, there has been little success in breeding them.",
            "importance": "Rhinos are very important to the environment and ecosystem in which they live. For example, greater one horned rhinos maintain the health of grasslands and the waterholes in which they wallow, which allows other herbivores and small animals to live in optimal conditions. Rhinos also disperse the seeds of plants and fruit they\u2019ve eaten through their dung, allowing their ecosystem to thrive.",
            "predators and threats": "Adult rhinos are at the top of the food chain and do not have any natural predators. Unfortunately, their biggest predator is humans. Rhino calves are a different story though; both African and Asian rhino calves are sometimes prey for large cats \u2014 lions and tigers respectively. In most instances, predators won\u2019t actively hunt calves but won\u2019t pass up on the opportunity to pick off a calf that strays from the herd. Calves are especially easy prey at night, as the poor eyesight of rhino mothers means it can be difficult for them to keep track of their offspring. Hyenas and Nile crocodiles also prey on rhino calves.Humans are the biggest threat to rhinos. Rhinos are hunted for their horns, which are sold illegally. Rhino horns are often ground up and used in traditional Asian medicines. They are thought to treat a range of ailments from fevers to cancer, and are also uses as a status symbol to display success and wealth is also increasingly common. Although a ban was put on international trade in rhino horn in 1977 and the medical use of rhino horn has been illegal since 1993, between 1960 and 1995, 98% of black rhinos were killed by poachers purely for their horns. Habitat loss due to humans is another threat to rhinos.",
            "in captivity": "Worldwide, 302 zoos hold 1037 rhinos. 174 of these hold 671 southern white rhinos; 61 zoos hold 184 black rhinos and 67 zoos hold 182 greater one-horned rhinos. While zoos used to be a place where you could go and look at exotic animals, they are now imperative in protecting and breeding endangered animals that are vulnerable in the wild.In zoos, rhinos are protected from poaching. There have also been reproduction efforts made in order to save almost extinct species of rhino. That being said, breeding in captivity is difficult and some conservationists have turned to in vitro fertilization. However, IVF is challenging within rhinos and there is a struggle to get immature eggs to develop outside of the female\u2019s body and also difficulty injecting sperm into these eggs.",
            "conservation efforts": "Fortunately, thanks to conservation efforts, there is hope for the rhino yet! The population of black rhinos has doubled this century and the population of the white rhino has gone from about 50 to nearly 20,000. This is thanks to poaching bans, as well as protection of rhinos in national parks and on reserves by rangers and guards. Efforts by zoos and other conservation organizations have also contributed to the rise in rhino populations recently.Learn more about the History of Rhinos"

            "right whale characteristics": "Right Whales are easily distinguished from other whales by the large number of callosities on their heads, a thick back without a dorsal fin and a long drooping mouth that begins high above the eye and then arches round beneath it. The body of the Right Whale is very dark grey or black with some white patches on the belly.The white patches on the whales skin around the callosites are not due to skin pigmentation, but are actually large colonies of whale lice buried in the whales skin. Adults Right Whales can measure between 11 \u2013 18 metres (36 \u2013 59 feet) in length and typically weigh 60 \u2013 80 tons. The most typical lengths are 13 \u2013 16 metres (42 \u2013 52 feet). The body is extremely robust with girth as much as 60% of total body length in some cases. Their tail fluke is also broad (up to 40% of body length).The North Pacific species of Right Whale is on average the largest of the three Eubalaena right whales. The largest specimens of these may weigh 100 tons.Right Whales have between 200 and 300 baleen plates on each side of the mouth. These are narrow and approximately 2 metres long and are covered in very thin hairs. The plates enable the whale to feed. The testicles of the Right Whale are likely to be the largest of any animal, each weighing around 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds). At 1% of the whales total body weight, this size is very large even taking into account the size of the whale. This suggests that sperm competition is important in the mating process.Right Whales have a distinctive wide V-shaped blow, caused by the widely-spaced blowholes on the top of the head. The blow rises to 5 metres (16 feet) above the oceans surface.",
            "right whale reproduction": "Female Right Whales reach sexual maturity at 6 \u2013 12 years and breed every 3 \u2013 5 years. Both reproduction and calving take place during the winter months. Calves are approximately 1 tonne (1.1 short tons) in weight and 4 \u2013 6 metres in length at birth following a gestation period of 1 year. The Right Whale grows rapidly in its first year, typically doubling in length. Weaning occurs after 8 months to 1 year and the growth rate in later years is not well understood, it may be highly dependent on whether a calf stays with its mother for a second year.",
            "right whale lifespan": "Very little is known about the life span of Right Whales. One of the few pieces of evidence is the case of a mother Atlantic Northern Right Whale that was photographed with a baby in 1935, then photographed again in 1959, 1980, 1985 and 1992, callosity patterns were used to ensure that it was the same animal. Finally, she was photographed in 1995 with a seemingly fatal head wound that is presumed to have been caused by her being struck by a ship. The animal was around 70 years of age at death. Research on Bowhead Whales suggest reaching this age is not uncommon and may even be exceeded.",
            "right whale behaviour": "Right Whales are slow swimmers, reaching only 5 knots (9 kilometres per hour) at top speed, however, they are highly acrobatic and frequently breach (jump clear of the sea surface), tail-slap and lobtail. Like other baleen whales, Right Whales are not gregarious and the typical group size is only two. Larger groups of up to twelve have been reported, however, these were not close-knit and may have been together only for a short time.",
            "right whale predators": "The Right Whales only predators are the killer whale and to some degree, humans. When danger is sensed, a group of Right Whales may come together in a circle, with their tails pointing outwards, to deter a predator. This defence is not always successful and calves are occasionally separated from their mother and killed.",
            "right whale diet": "The Right Whales diet consists primarily of zooplankton and tiny crustaceans such as copepods, as well as krill and pteropods, although they are occasionally opportunistic feeders. Right Whales feed by \u2018skimming\u2019 along with their mouth open. Water and prey enters the mouth but only the water can pass through the baleen and out again into the open sea. Therefore, for a Right Whale to feed, the prey must occur in sufficient numbers to generate the whales interest, be large enough that the baleen plates can filter it and be small enough so that it does not have the speed to escape. The \u2018skimming\u2019 may take place on the surface, underwater or even close to the oceans bottom, indicated by mud occasionally observed on Right Whales bodies.",
            "right whale vocalization": "Vocalizations made by Right Whales are not elaborate compared to those made by other whale species. The whales make groans, pops and belches that are typically around 500 Hertz. The purpose of the sounds is not known, however, it is likely to be a form of communication between whales within the same group.",
            "conservation status of the right whale": "The leading cause of death among Atlantic Northern Right Whales, which migrate through some of the worlds busiest shipping lanes whilst journeying off the east coast of the United States, is injury sustained from colliding with ships. At least 16 reported deaths due to ship strikes were reported between 1970 and 1999 and probably many more remain unreported.Both the North Atlantic Right Whale and North Pacific Right Whale species are listed as \u2018endangered\u2019 by CITES and the IUCN, and under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.A second major cause of death in North Atlantic Right Whales is entanglement in fishing equipment. Right Whales filter feed plankton with their mouths wide open, exposing themselves to the risk of entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Right Whales commonly wrap rope around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Most manage to escape with minor scarring, however, some get seriously and persistently entangled. Such cases if sighted are sometimes sucessfully disentangled, however, others are not and they die a most gruesome death over a period of months. There has been a major focus on the conservation status of the right whale in terms of an endangered species. However equally significant is the extreme animal welfare concern such chronic fatal entanglements represent.The Southern Right Whale, listed as \u2018endangered\u2019 by CITES and \u2018lower risk \u2013 conservation dependent\u2019 by the IUCN, is protected in the jurisdictional waters of all countries with known breeding populations (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, New Zealand, South Africa and Uruguay). In Brazil, a federal Environmental Protection Area encompassing some 1,560 kilometres squared (602 square miles) and 130 kilometres (80 miles) of coastline in Santa Catarina State was established in 2000 to protect the species main breeding grounds in Brazil and promote regulated whale watching.On June 26, 2006, NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) proposed the Strategy to Reduce Ship Strikes to North Atlantic Right Whales. The proposal, which is opposed by the shipping industry, envisages imposing a speed cap of 10 knots (11.5 miles per hour; 18.5 kilometres per hour) on specific routes during calving season for vessels 20 metres (65 feet) or longer. The proposal is open for comments until August 25, 2006. According to the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), 25 of the 71 Right Whale deaths reported since 1970 resulted from ship strikes."

            "desc": "The Risso\u2019s Dolphin (Grampus griseus), sometimes called the gray dolphin, is the only species of dolphin in the genus Grampus. Risso\u2019s dolphins are cetaceans found worldwide in temperate and tropical waters, usually in deep waters rather than close to land. As well as the tropical parts of the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, Rissos are also found in the Mediterranean and Red Seas, though are absent from the Black Sea. Their preferred environment is just off the continental shelf on steep banks, with water depths varying from 400 \u2013 1000 metres and water temperature at least 10\u00b0 Centigrade and preferably in excess of 15\u00b0 Centigrade. Another common name for Risso\u2019s dolphin is the \u2018Grampus\u2019, although historically, it was the common name used to describe the orca (killer whale). The specific name griseus refers to the mottled (almost scarred) grey color of the dolphins body. These dolphins belong to the family Delphinidae, the dolphin family, which includes members such as common dolphins, pacific white-sided dolphins, and bottlenose dolphins. They also belong to the order Artiodactyla. Risso\u2019s dolphins are closely related to pilot whales, pygmy killer whales, melon-headed whales, and false killer whales. The population of Risso\u2019s dolphins around the continental shelf of the United States has been recorded to be in excess of 60,000. In the Pacific a census recorded 175,000 individuals in eastern tropical waters and 85,000 in the west. No global estimate of population exists. Risso\u2019s dolphins in the United States are not endangered or threatened. Like all marine mammals, they are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.",
            "lifespan": "Risso\u2019s dolphins are believed to have a life span of at least 20 years, but have been known to live up to 40 years old.",
            "diet": "Risso\u2019s dolphins prey on neritic, oceanic, and occasionally bottom dwelling organisms. Their diet consists of fish, krill, crustaceans, and cephalopods, such as anchovies, squid, octopus, and cuttlefish.They eat mostly at night, when their prey is closer to the surface. Their preferred depth to eat at is between 600 and 800 m below the surface of the sea. They have been known to move into continental shelf waters when following squid.",
            "behaviour": "Risso\u2019s dolphins are typically found in groups of between 10 and 30 animals, but they have been reported as solitary individuals, in pairs, or in loose aggregations of hundreds and thousands. They are also often seen in the company of other whales and dolphins, such as bottlenose dolphins, gray whales, northern right whale dolphins, and Pacific white-sided dolphins.Their groups are formed based on age and sex class, with strongest associations occurring between adult females and adult males. When hunting for food, these groups spread out in a long line. They are not known for undertaking large migrations, but they do travel within their local distribution area in search of areas where prey is abundant.Risso\u2019s dolphins spend 77% of their time traveling, 13% engaged in social activity, 5% feeding, and about 3.7% resting. They are often seen breaching, clearing the water and slapping their heads, tails or sides on the surface. They also engage in chasing, spy hopping (lifting their head above the surface of the water to have a look around), biting, aerial acrobatics and lob-tailing. Juvenile dolphins are particularly energetic.These animals have been known to be aggressive and flipper slapping between individuals, striking with flukes and dorsal fins, and body blows have been witnessed.Some groups are shy, however, some allow humans to approach close to them. Risso\u2019s dolphins do not often \u2018bow ride\u2019 in front of boats like some other dolphins, but may swim beside or in the bubbly wake that a boat leaves.Risso\u2019s dolphins can dive to at least 1,000 feet and hold their breath for 30 minutes, but they usually make shorter dives of just a few minutes. When at the surface, they have a small inconspicuous blow if backlit (which is more distinct after long dives), and their head partially emerges at a 45\u00b0 angle. Before diving, they usually take 10 to 12 breaths at 15- to 20-second intervals and will often display their tails.",
            "communication": "Risso\u2019s Dolphins are highly social and there often seems to be much communication going on between animals in a group with much dramatic splashing at the surface.They also use echolocation to locate, identify, and determine the distance of various objects in their environment. One of the most well-known sounds of delphinids are clicks. Risso\u2019s dolphins are also able to emit sonar clicks in the water while the majority of their forehead is above water, a characteristic unique to this species. They also make a number of different vocalizations, including barks, buzzes, grunts, chirps, whistles, and simultaneous whistle and pulse sounds.",
            "reproduction": "Little is known about mating between this dolphin species. It is thought they are polygynous and polyandrous. Breeding and calving may occur year-round, but the season may vary geographically (especially in the North Pacific), with most animal births occurring from summer to fall in Japanese waters and from fall to winter in California waters.Individuals reach sexual maturity when they reach a length of about 8.5 to 9 feet, which is usually when females are between 8 and 10 years of age and when men are between 10 and 12 years of age. Risso\u2019s dolphins have a gestation period of 13 to 14 months.Females give birth to a single calf with calves usually being between 3.5 to 5.5 feet in length and weigh about 45 pounds. They can nurse for up to 3 years before being weaned.",
            "location and habitat": "Risso\u2019s dolphins have an extensive distribution and can be found in temperate, subtropical and tropical waters of oceans worldwide. Their preferred habitats appear to be mid-temperate waters of the continental shelf and slope between 30\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 latitude. In the Northern Hemisphere, their range includes the Gulf of Alaska, Gulf of Mexico, Newfoundland, Azores, Norway, Japan, Russia, the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. In the Southern Hemisphere, their range includes Argentina, Australia, Chile, South Africa, and New Zealand.Risso\u2019s dolphins are present year round throughout most of their geographic range. Not much is known about migratory patterns within this species, but it is thought that residents of the northern-most parts of their range migrate seasonally between summering and wintering grounds.Their range depth is between 400 and 1,200 m.",
            "predators": "Risso\u2019s dolphins are probably preyed upon by killer whales, sharks and possibly false killer whales (although no incidents of attacks on Risso\u2019s dolphins have actually been observed).Risso\u2019s Dolphin ConservationRisso\u2019s dolphins are abundant and have a broad geographic range. As a result, they are classified as a species of \u201cLeast Concern\u201d on the IUCN\u2019s Red List of Threatened Species. However, unfortunately there is not a lot of information about the population status of these animals, so it is difficult to know what their conservation needs are. Risso\u2019s dolphins are protected in the United States under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1992. In the Mediterranean Sea, the animals are protected by the regional ACCOBAMS and in the North and Baltic Sea by the ASCOBANS Agreements.Bycatch is among the worst threats to these animals, meaning that they are caught up in fishing nets and then drown. In some regions, they are intentionally killed for their meat or oil, or killed by fishermen who consider them to be competition. Currently, Japan, Indonesia, the Solomon Islands, and The Lesser Antilles hunt Risso\u2019s dolphins.As a deep-diving species, they are also threatened by noise pollution, caused mainly by ship traffic and military sonar. This species is also heavily burdened by toxins such as mercury and chlorides, particularly in the Mediterranean Sea, but also in other regions.\u00a0\u00a0"

The scientific name for the Southern Rockhopper Penguin is (Eudyptes chrysocome).",
            "characteristics": "The Rockhopper penguin is the smallest yellow-crested, black-and-white penguin, reaching a length of 55 centimetres and weighing 5 to 8 pounds. Rockhopper Penguins have distinctive crest feathers on their heads, bright orange-red beaks and tiny blood red eyes. Male and female Rockhopper Penguins are very similar in appearance, though males are larger.The Rockhopper penguins are distinguished from the Macaroni penguin and other members of the crested species by their smaller size and the thin, vivid yellow tassels which extend along the sides of the brow but do not meet between the eyes.The top of the head has spiked black feathers. Like all penguins, Rockhopper Penguins have a big head, a short, thick neck, a streamlined shape, a short, wedge-shaped tail and strong, stiff, flipper-like wings. For camouflage from predators, their under parts are mostly white, while the upper parts are blue-black. The Rockhopper Penguin has slate-grey upper parts and a straight, bright yellow eyebrow ending in long yellowish plumes projecting sideways behind a red eye.Rockhopper Penguins are loud, noisy and feisty birds. They are quick to attack anyone or anything that bothers them. Rockhopper Penguins get their name because they hop over rocks and crevices on the shores where they live.",

Royal penguins look very much like Macaroni Penguins, but have a white face and chin instead of the macaronis\u2019 black visage. They got their name thanks to the head feathers that make them look very majestic. Royal penguins are found in the southern hemisphere near the Macquarie and Campbell Islands to the south of New Zealand. There is some controversy over whether they are a sub-species of macaroni penguins as both have black and yellow crests on their head. The royal penguin is the tallest crested penguin and belongs to the order Sphenisciformes.",
            "lifespan": "The royal penguin has an average lifespan of between 15 and 20 years. Many penguins do not live past the first few years of life, as younger penguins lack the physical endurance to tolerate environmental conditions and threats. Unfortunately, royal penguins often die from plastic ingestion, parasitic disease, or predation.",
            "diet": "Royal penguins are carnivores and eat crustaceans (mostly krill), small fish and squid caught by pursuit-diving normally at depths of 50 to 150 feet. If necessary, they can dive up to 226 meters for food. Crustaceans make up about 51% of daily intake, with the remaining 49% made up of fish and squid.Dives rarely exceed two minutes in duration. Like all penguins, they are excellent swimmers, using their webbed feet, powerful flippers and streamlined bodies to \u2018fly\u2019 through the water at speeds approaching 20 miles per hour. Royal penguins will travel a range from 68 km to 600 km for foraging. They use chemical communication to smell prey under water while foraging.",
            "behaviour": "Royal penguins are social animals and, like most sea birds, they form long-lasting bonds and nest in large colonies. Despite living socially, they are very territorial of their individual nesting areas.These penguins are thought to be migratory, but very little is known about their migration or migratory patterns.Royal penguins communicate by a technique called vocalization and also by performing physical behaviors called displays. Through these techniques, they communicate information about partner and chick recognition, nesting territories, nest relief rituals, mating information, and defense against intruders.When a predator is in closer proximity, the penguins will move their head and flippers in order to intimidate before attacking. The only situation in which royal penguins will not retaliate against attack is when females are incubating the egg. Females that are attacked during this time will lean down and cower, withstanding the pecking against their dorsal side to protect the egg.Royal penguins also attack others close by as a form of entertainment. They will attack with open beaks, which will turn into a tug-of-war when the beaks interlock. To avoid confrontation, they will walk swiftly with their body upright, head bowed, and flippers held forward.",
            "reproduction": "Male royal penguins will return to Macquarie Island for the breeding season in early October. Females arrive on the island about 10 days later to find their mate. Those 10 days allow females additional time for building up their fat reserves to have energy for mating. These penguins are a monogamous species, returning to the same mate year after year during the breeding season.If a penguin needs to find a new mate, males will try to attract females by swinging their heads up and down while calling out in hopes that a female will choose them as their mate. When reuniting with an established mate at the start of the season, royal penguins will turn their heads and lean into each other to touch and show acceptance.Royal penguins usually reach sexual maturity and breed for the first time at the age of five. Intruders are kept at pecking range and waving of wings is an indication to the intruder they are too close. Their nests consist of shallow depressions in the sand or grass and are lined with stones and grass. They are defensive of their nesting area of approximately 2m^2 around their nest.Two eggs are commonly laid but the first egg is often smaller and discarded. Usually only one chick is reared. Incubation lasts for 35 days and is done in 12 day shifts by both parents. Once hatched, the male guards the chick for 10 \u2013 20 days whilst the female feeds the chick daily. After this, the baby penguins form nursery groups with other chicks called \u2018cr\u00e8ches\u2019 where they huddle together for warmth and protection. Here they are fed every 2 \u2013 3 days. At 65 days the juvenile is ready to go to sea, by which time their adult feathers have grown in.Juvenile royal penguins closely resemble adults with a few exceptions. The crest feathers don\u2019t develop fully until adulthood. Juveniles also have smaller, darker bills that are more brownish, matching their dorsal feathers. They lack the white rump patch of adults. The white patch and change of feather color occurs with the first molt as well as yearly growth. Yearling royal penguins have a mat of yellow feathers in place of a crest. The crest fully grows in and royal penguins achieve adult stature and coloration after the third annual molt.\u00a0Royal Penguin Location and HabitatRoyal penguins are native to the sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island, located in the Pacific Ocean between New Zealand and the Antarctic region. They have been seen in Australia, New Zealand, and the Antarctic region as well.It is unclear whether this penguin is a migratory species, as it is unknown where royal penguins reside during the non-breeding season (mid-April to Mid-September).During the breeding season, they will nest on Macquarie Island, up to 1.6 kilometers from the shore. The island has many rocky formations with shrub vegetation, providing nesting grounds of unvegetated, level, rocky, or sandy ground surrounded by rocks. Royal penguins nesting on hills or sloped cliffs (up to 200 meters in elevation) use rocks to build their nests and those who nest on the beach use sand. Nests are built near streams that are both a freshwater source and a route to and from the ocean.Royal Penguin Conservation StatusRoyal penguins are listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List. The population used to be over 3 million, but have been hunted for their oil in the past. Nowadays, the royal penguin population remains steady at around 1.7 million individuals, which is around 850,000 pairs.There are many conservation efforts to help increase the current population of royal penguins. Many of these efforts have involved the eradication of predators such as feral cats, black rats, and European rabbits on Macquarie Island. Management of human interaction also has played a role, to prevent climate change, habitat degradation, pollution, and disease from harming these penguins.Unfortunately, they are only found on one island group, so a natural or human disaster could greatly reduce their numbers.",
            "predators": "In the wild, royal penguin predators include leopard seals, sharks, black rats, skuas, giant petrels and wekas.\u00a0\u00a0"

The African Sacred Ibis has been introduced into France, Italy, Spain, Taiwan, and Southern Florida in the United States.",
            "sacred ibis characteristics": "The Sacred Ibis is a distinctive large wading bird that measures 75 centimetres (30 inches) in length and weighs 1.35 kilograms (3 pounds). It has a wingspan of 112 \u2013 124 centimetres (44 \u2013 49 inches).The plumage of the sacred ibis is mainly white in color with black plumes on its lower back. Its small head and slender, curved neck are also black and practically bald. The sacred ibis has small black eyes and a long, slender, downward curved bill which is used to probe into sand and mud in shallow water or in grass and soil when foraging.The legs of the sacred ibis are long and black and its feet are partially webbed like most wading birds. When in flight, the wing tips of the primary flight feathers are black which display a black border to the rear of the white wings.",
            "sacred ibis habitat": "The sacred ibis thrives in large colonies near waterways throughout Africa. It inhabits wetlands such as marshes, swamps, riverbanks, flood plains and mud flats both coastal and inland. It is also known to visit pastures, ploughed land and rubbish dumps.The sacred ibis is such an adaptable feeder that it supplements its diet by feeding at rubbish dumps, which helps it to survive in temperate regions during winter months.",
            "sacred ibis diet": "The Sacred Ibis is an omnivorous scavenger who feeds up on insects including grasshoppers and locusts, insect larvae, amphibians and other small aquatic animals such as crustaceans, frogs, fish and small reptiles. They have also been known to eat eggs, carrion, snakes, other small birds and even refuse. The sacred ibis will also use its long beak to probe into the soil for invertebrates such as earthworms.",
            "sacred ibis behaviour": "The sacred ibis is a gregarious bird living, breeding and traveling in large flocks. It is generally found in groups of 2 \u2013 20 individuals although they have been known to occasionally flock in larger groups of up to 300 birds.When in flight, like most wading birds, ibises fly in a \u2018V\u2019 formation which reduces wind resistance for trailing birds. When the front ibis becomes tired, it falls to the back of the formation and another ibis takes its place at the front.The sacred ibis is generally a silent bird, however, it may sometimes produce grunting or croaking noises while in flight or at breeding grounds. Other Ibis species, on the other hand, are more vocal such as its close relative, the Hadeda Ibis.The sacred ibis nests in tree colonies and also on the ground in papyrus thickets or in bushes. They often nest with other wading birds such as Herons. Their nests are generally untidy platforms of sticks and usually built in baobab trees.The sacred ibis migrates over 700 kilometres north or south of the equator to breed during the rainy season. Breeding colonies contain between 50 \u2013 2000 mating pairs nesting in bushes or on islands.",
            "sacred ibis reproduction": "The sacred ibis breeds in sub-saharan Africa. The female lays around 2 \u2013 5 eggs which are incubated for 28 \u2013 29 days by both parents. Eggs are usually laid during the rainy season or in flooded areas during the dry season.Young ibises are born with a dull white plumage, some feathering on the neck and a small bill. Both parents will take turns to feed the chicks and to guard the nest site until the chicks are large enough to defend and feed themselves. Ibis chicks fledge around 39 \u2013 45 days and become mature at 4 \u2013 5 years old.The average life span of the sacred ibis is up to 20 years.",
            "sacred ibis conservation status": "The African Sacred Ibis is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. Habitat destruction, poaching and insecticide use have all caused the decline of several species of Ibis.The saced ibis moves around croplands helping egrets and others to rid the area of insect pests. Because of their role in helping to control crop pests, they are very valuable to farmers. However, agricultural pesticide usage has endangered the birds in several locations.Did you know this about the Sacred Ibis?The Sacred Ibis was once common in Egypt until 1850, where the ancient Egyptians believed it was the embodiement of \u2018Thoth\u2019 the God of Wisdom and master of time. Many ibis have been found mummified in tombs of pharaohs. The sacred ibis was also of practical use to the villagers, making pools safe to bathe in by feeding on the water snails that carried the bilharzias liver parasite.Ibises are an ancient species with fossil records going back 60 million years."

Sand lizards are the only member of their family and are sometimes called the viviparous lizard. While these lizards are fairly uncommon, there\u2019s still lots to learn about them. Keep reading on to find out more. \u00a0",
            "lifespan": "Sand lizards can live up to around 20 years old, but on average they live between 5 and 8 years.",
            "diet": "Because sand lizards are reptiles and cold-blooded, they do not need to eat that much. They are carnivores and their diet mainly consists of spiders and insects, such as grasshoppers.However, they can survive for long periods if food is not available. If they get hungry enough, they will also eat some flowers and even their own young.When hunting, a sand lizard will stop and listen for movement. Once they hear a sound, they will move their heads backward until they locate the source. They will then pounce on it with their mouths. However, if the prey gets more than 60 cm away, they will ignore it and continue foraging for food.",
            "behavior": "Sand lizards and generally solitary animals, but you may see them in pairs. A sand lizard moves about a lot during the day and can travel at speeds of up to 30 miles per hour. They must spend a good amount of time basking in the sun during the day, because they do not generate body heat and rely on the sun to keep warm.They do not come out of their burrows in the morning until they sense that it is warming up outside, and then return before sunset. It is thought that they need sunlight to warm their bodies before they have the energy to hunt.If the weather gets too warm and the ground is too hot, sand lizards will quickly lift each foot off the ground to keep their feet from burning. They may also lay on their bellies with all four feet in the air at the same time.",
            "predators": "The biggest predator of sand lizards are birds of prey, especially kestrels. They are also hunted by the smooth snake, foxes, badgers, crows and weasels.To escape predators, sand lizards will first of all lie very still. If this does not work, they will try to escape to their burrow. Failing this, they will release their tail which will wiggle on the ground for several minutes. This distracts the predator for enough time to allow the lizard to escape.Lizards can bite humans if they feel threatened. However, their bite is not poisonous.",
            "breeding": "It is thought that female lizards choose their mates, and like to mate with those who are distantly related. The breeding season is during March and April, during which time the female will mate with several males, but she will only lay eggs once each year. She usually lays around 8 eggs.The eggs are left buried in sand exposed to the sun which helps to keep them warm. They stay in the nest for three-to-four months before they hatch in August or September. After the mother has laid the eggs, she leaves the nest, which means baby sand lizards must fend for themselves when they are born. The hatchlings reach sexual maturity at around 2 years old.During mating season, males can become very aggressive. They will even fight each other to death.",
            "hibernation": "Sand lizards live in burrows and stay in their burrows during the winter months. Males can begin hibernation from late August-early September but females often start to hibernate about a month later, in September or early October. In the spring, around April and May, male sand lizards come out of hibernation first.LocationThese lizards can be found across much of Europe, and are England\u2019s rarest lizards. In the UK, they are are restricted to south and west England, and to a couple of sites in Wales. There are also a small amount of sand lizards in Scotland.Sand lizards have limited distribution in Scandinavia, west and south-east France, Italy where it is present only in isolated colonies, European Turkey, most of Greece and the Iberian Peninsula, but can be found in western areas of Russia, Mongolia and China.",
            "habitat": "While sand lizards generally need a heathland habitat with varied vegetation for both basking and sheltering, they are very adaptive and often have to adapt to wherever they live. They need the area to be soft to create burrows and like mossy and sandy areas so that they can lay their eggs. They also generally preferred a sloped area. In the day, they hunt for food in grassy areas and then return to sand areas when the sun sets.\u00a0Conservation StatusDespite being one of the rarest reptiles anyway, it is thought that the population of sand lizards is rapidly declining, and this is mainly down to humans. The main reason for the loss of sand lizards is urban development, which leads to habitat loss.While the International Union for Conservation of Nature considers the species to be of least concern, the Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981 and the United Kingdom Post-2010 Biodiversity Framework list it as a priority species. The sand lizard is strictly protected by British and European law which makes it an offence to kill, injure, capture or disturb them, damage or destroy their habitat, or to possess or trade in them.The sand lizard population is being helped by captive breeding and reintroduction. It is much easier to breed these lizards in captivity and release them into the wild, because sand lizards cannot disperse far or colonize newly suitable areas. This means that, without help, they are very unlikely to breed in new areas and the population will continue to decline.\u00a0",
            "\u2013 summary of facts": "The Sand Lizard (Lacerta agilis) is distributed across most of Europe (except the Iberian peninsula, west and south-east France, most of Great Britain, Italy where it is present only in isolated colonies, European Turkey, most of Greece) and eastwards to Mongolia.The Sand Lizard has a light underbelly and a dorsal stripe.Males tend to be darker in color and turn green during the mating season.Sand lizards are stocky and short-legged, with short heads, blunt snouts and short tails.They can reach up to 25 centimetres in length.Females are generally longer than the males.Male sand lizards fight ferociously for females during the mating season.Sand lizards grab the neck of their opponent with their jaws and then roll over and over each other as if they were wrestling, until one, usually the smaller lizard, retreats.Although restricted to heathland habitats and sand dunes in Britain, in mainland Europe sand lizards can be found in hedgerows, fields, woodland margins, parks, gardens and on roadsides.In France, sand lizards can also be found in mountainous habitats.The Sand lizards\u2019 diet mainly consists of invertebrates such as slugs, spiders and insects, but will also feed on a variety of other foods such as fruit and flower heads.Sand lizards are endangered in Britain, mainly due to the loss and fragmentation of their heathland habitat.Under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, it is an offence to kill, injure or sell sand lizards.\u00a0"

            "s conservation": "Scarlet Macaws are an endangered species due to their capture as pets and loss of habitat.Before the Scarlet Macaws decline in population, its distribution included much of Costa Rica. However, by the 1960s Scarlet Macaws had been decreasing in numbers due to a combination of factors, particularly hunting, poaching and the destruction of habitat through deforestation. Further, the spraying of pesticides by companies cultivating and selling bananas for export played a significant role in decreasing Scarlet Macaw populations.As pets, Scarlet Macaws are popular cage birds for those who can pay both the high price of the bird and the price of the big cage required. You should beable to tolerate their loud calls and can give them considerable time outside their cages. They are considered sociable and affectionate and some talk quite well."

The Schneiders Dwarf Caiman prefers freshwater riverines, particularly shallow forest streams. Adults often spend much of their time in burrows away from water, traveling overland between burrows and water to forage. The Schneider\u2019s Dwarf Caiman is found in similar habitats to the Cuviers Dwarf Caiman in both Venezuela and Bolivia. It is reported at altitudes as high as 1,300 metres in Venezuela. The shape of their snout may indicate increased preference for faster-flowing water.",
            "diet": "Diet changes with age, as with many species of crocodilian. It has been shown that the diet of caimans in the wild is dependant upon their habitat preferences. The young tend to eat a greater proportion of terrestrial invertebrates than other caiman species and the adults include a much larger proportion of terrestrial vertebrates in their diet such as snakes and mammals (e.g. large rodents such as the Capybara), together with a few fish (which are more common in the diet of the juveniles).Diet depends on prey availability. The Schneiders Dwarf Caiman are reported to forage from burrows at night, often near water, but also in the surrounding forest within the territories \u2013 which can range for several kilometres.",
            "reproduction": "The Schneider\u2019s Dwarf Caiman is relatively solitary outside the breeding season, with extensive territories. Females begin to construct mound nests before the onset of the yearly rains. Most are at least 1.3 metres in length when they start to breed, males at least 1.4 metres (usually between 10 and 20 years of age).Nests are often found within very close proximity of termite mounds. The reasons for this are thought to be concerned with maintenance of a high incubation temperature, utilising vented heat from the termite mound. The number of eggs laid is in the range of 10 to 20. Incubation time is very long for a crocodilian, lasting as long as 115 days.Hatchlings emerge as water levels are rising from the rains. Juveniles disperse over a wide range following hatching, with adults maintaining permanent territories over wide areas. While juvenile mortality is relatively high, adult mortality is very low.

The Sea Lions are much more likely to encounter these predators when they have to further out into the waters to find food.Sea Lions often suffer from an array of health problems associated with humans. They include pneumonia, epilepsy, and various types of cancers. Research shows that the pups are immune to such problems as long as they are fed milk from their mothers. Those that are in captivity from an early age may develop these problems in the first year and the only difference is the milk they are given.The future is unsure for many species of Sea Lions. Years of them being destroyed by humans has taken a toll on them. Environmental concerns continue to cause problems for them in their natural habitats. The fact that humans are also taking control over the waters where they once lived in peace is also another huge concern. Even with conservation efforts in place there is still a great deal of work to be done if these animals are going to survive.What is The Difference Between Seals and Sea Lions?",

            "desc": "Sea snakes are closely related to Cobras. They are aquatic rather than land dwelling snakes. True sea snakes only live in water. Sea Snakes have adapted to a life in water and have small flattened heads that minimizes water resistance when they swim. The Sea Snakes body is compressed as an adaptation for swimming and the snakes are so thoroughly aquatic that they are either clumsy or slow when brought ashore.  Sea Snakes are only moderately large, rarely exceeding 2 metres in length, often with peculiarly small heads for their body size.",
            "sea snake characteristics": "Sea Snakes are only moderately large, rarely exceeding 2 metres in length, often with peculiarly small heads for their body size.Only genus \u2018Laticauda\u2019 (which includes the Black Banded Sea Krait) has the typical broad ventral scales of snakes and it is often considered the least advanced of the sea snakes. Nevertheless, similar to cetaceans, their lungs still require them to surface occasionally to breathe. Oxygen intake through the skin has been demonstrated in sea snakes. Sea snakes like warm, tropical waters, however, when the water gets too warm, they swim down to cooler temperatures.Transmitters attached to yellow-bellied sea snakes show they can dive to about 150 feet and can stay underwater for more than three hours. Like seabirds and sea turtles, sea snakes have special glands that collect extra salt from the blood. The snakess salt glands lie beneath their tongues. Each time a sea snake flicks its tongue, it is ejecting salt back into the ocean.Sea snakes have specialized flattened tails for swimming and have valves over their nostrils which are closed underwater. Unlike eels, sea snakes lack gills or fins, instead having scales and spending much of their time underwater, they must surface regularly to breathe.",
            "sea snake habitat": "Sea snakes are confined to the tropical oceans, chiefly the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean. The yellow-bellied sea snake, (Pelamis platurus), extends to the eastern Pacific. The olive sea snake, (Aipysurus laevis), tends to live in reefs.",
            "sea snake behaviour and diet": "The yellow-bellied sea snake (Pelamis platurus) is pelagic (living in open oceans or seas rather than waters adjacent to land or inland waters) and is seen on occasions floating in massive groups. Fish that come up to shelter under slicks provide food for the snakes. Occasionally these yellow-bellied sea snakes get washed up on beaches after storms and pose a hazard to children.Sea snakes are aggressive only during the mating season in the winter, the sea snake is very curious and they become fascinated by elongated objects such as high pressure hoses.The Sea snakes favourite food is fish. Sea snakes prey on fish (including eels) and crustaceans. A couple of species are specialised in eating fish eggs. Others are specialised in eating certain fish species.",
            "sea snake reproduction": "Except for a single genus, all sea snakes are ovoviviparous (development of eggs that remain within the mothers body up until they hatch or are about to hatch.). The young are born alive in the water where they live out their entire life cycle. In some species, the young are quite large, sometimes up to half as long as their mother. The one exception is the genus \u2018Laticauda\u2019, which are oviparous (animals that lay eggs with little or no other embryonic development within the mother). Its five species all lay their eggs on land.",
            "sea snake venom": "Sea snakes may not be the most venomous in the world, however, their venom is more toxic than that of Mojave rattlesnakes and king cobras. Sea snakes venom contains some of the same chemicals found in cobra venom, only more concentrated in form."

            "desc": "Sea urchins are globular, spiny sea creatures that make up the class Echinoidea. There are around 950 species of sea urchin, and they inhabit the seabed of every ocean and every depth zone, from the tide line to 15,000 feet deep. The name urchin is an old word for hedgehog, which sea urchins resemble; they have archaically been called sea hedgehogs. The scientific name of these marine invertebrates is Echinoidia, which is also the name of their class. They can range from 3 to 10 cm (1 to 4 in) in diameter and have hard shells (tests). These tests are covered in spikes, which they are most known for, and help to protect them from predators as they cannot swim. They can move slowly along the sea floor, using small, adhesive tube feet among their spines. Sea urchins eat algae mostly, although will also eat slow moving animals. Their main predators are sea otters and starfish, as well as the wolf eel and triggerfish. Sea urchins are edible, although not all species are, and are caught and sold in some parts of the world. They can sting humans when touched, but these stings are mostly harmless although may trigger some allergic reactions.",
            "lifespan": "The lifespan of sea urchins can vary greatly depending on the species. These animals could live anywhere from 15 to 200 years!",
            "diet": "Sea urchins are primarily herbivorous and the majority of their diet is made up of algae and kelp. However, they can also feed on sea cucumbers, mussels, worms, sponges, and brittle stars.With their feeding and grazing habits, the sea urchin can help to keep ecosystems in check. However, if populations of sea urchins get too large in certain areas, they can completely strip marine environments of plant material.",
            "behavior": "Sea urchins are nocturnal, hiding in crevices during the day and coming out at night to feed. They are very sensitive to touch, chemicals and light, despite the fact that they don\u2019t have eyes. Sea urchins are fairly social animals who prefer to live close to each other.Sea urchins produce underwater sounds that contribute to the underwater soundscape. Sound levels in coastal waters tend to increase immediately before sunrise and after sunset, which may be an important source of information for other marine lifestyle.Sea urchins do have the ability to bite or harm humans. Sea urchins possess venom \u2014 some carry venom in their spines, while others have venom in their tubular feet. However, most species are actually not poisonous when they sting or bite humans.When stung by their spines or bitten by their pedicellaria, the venom will only leave puncture wounds or may trigger some allergic reactions. One species, the flower urchin, is said to be the most dangerous of all sea urchins. It has the ability to temporarily paralyze humans, and some stings by these sea urchins have even resulted in death.",
            "reproduction": "Sea urchin reproduction mostly occurs during the summer season. Sea urchins have separate male and female sexes, although no distinguishing features are visible externally.During the breeding period, the female releases millions of tiny eggs coated in jelly into the water. Some species, however, do not let their eggs float freely in the water. Instead, these species protect their eggs by holding on to them using their spines.Similarly, the males release sperms into the water which meet with the eggs, and fertilization occurs. A swimming embryo forms within half a day which later develops into a corn-shaped larva. For some species, these larvae come equipped with their food sources, in the form of yolk, thus eliminating the need for feeding. For most sea urchin species, though, the larva has twelve arm-like structures covered with little hairs (cilia) used for feeding, which can be used to capture food.It can take several months for the larva to transform into a developed sea urchin. Once the larva is ready to develop fully, it sinks to the bottom of the ocean. After sinking, it takes around one hour for them to develop into adults. They usually develop into an adult at around five years of age, although some will reach sexual maturity sooner.\u00a0Sea Urchin Location and HabitatSea urchins live in oceans throughout the world and can found on the bottom of the sea bed, from the tide line to 15,000 feet deep. They reside where there is a lot of food, amongst coral, substrate and kelp beds. Sea urchins can be found in all climates, from warm seas to polar oceans, but most species are found on temperate and tropical coasts.Sea Urchin Conservation StatusSea urchins are generally abundant across the world and most species are not under threat of extinction. However, in a lot of places, sea urchins are overfished and the high demand for their meat in places like Japan could be a cause for concern. The European edible sea urchin is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN red list because of its high demand. Collector urchins are also exploited.In the Mediterranean, the purple sea urchin population is currently also in a near threatened state. This is not just due to fishing \u2014 factors that have decimated the species include warming sea temperatures and invasive fish that eat algae, depriving the urchins of a diet staple.Despite this, the majority of sea urchin species are thriving, and, with 950 species of them, it is unlikely they are going to die out any time soon.",
            "predators": "The main predators of the sea urchin are shellfish like crabs and lobsters, sea otters, starfish, wolf eel and triggerfish. Fortunately, their sharp spikes can help deter predators from eating them, although predation can help to keep sea urchin populations in check.",
            "as food": "There are 18 edible species of sea urchin, including the European edible sea urchin, violet sea urchin and collector urchin. Sea urchins are not eaten whole, but the gonads of both male and female sea urchins, usually called sea urchin roe or corals, are delicacies in many parts of the world, especially Japan, where they are sold as sushi or sashimi. The green, red, and purple urchins have the highest demand by fisheries globally because their lobes tend to be larger and visually more appetizing.\u00a0Sea Urchin FAQsWhere do sea urchins live?Sea urchins live all over the world. They reside at the bottom of the ocean amongst substrate, kelp forests and corals, which can be very close to the surface, or as deep down as 15,000 feet where it is very dark. Some prefer warmer water, while other thrive in colder climates.Do sea urchins have brains or eyes?Sea urchins do not have brains. Instead their whole entire nervous system acts like a brain! They also do not have eyes, but it has been indicated that they can see with their tubular feet!Are sea urchins dangerous?Some species of sea urchin carry venom, with urchins in tropical environments are more likely to harm. If you step on a sea urchin, you are likely to feel a sharp pain, which may be followed by side effects of nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing and muscle weakness.Despite this, sea urchin stings are very rarely deadly, and there have only been a few reported deaths as a result of sea urchin stings. These have mostly been divers who have drowned following muscle weakness after a sting.Can you eat sea urchins?Yes! There are 18 species of edible sea urchin that are harvested around the world. The edible parts of the urchin are the gonads. They are a very popular dish in Japan.What do sea urchins eat?Sea urchins mostly eat kelp and algae. However, some species also eat sea cucumbers, mussels and sponges. In fact, these animals will feed on almost anything that floats by!\u00a0Sea Urchin TaxonomySea urchins are members of the phylum Echinodermata, which also includes other echinoderms like sea stars, sea cucumbers, brittle stars, and crinoids. Just like other members of Echinodermata, sea urchins have five-fold symmetry and move with their tiny tube feet.Sea urchins belong to the class Echinoidea. Within this class, there are two subclasses: Euechinoidea (\u201cmodern\u201d sea urchins, including irregular ones) and Cidaroidea or \u201cslate-pencil urchins\u201d, which have very thick, blunt spines, with algae and sponges growing on them. Irregular echinoids, such as sand dollars, sea biscuits, and heart urchins, are classed inside Euechinoidea.Inside these two subclasses, there are four superorders and thirteen orders. There are around 950 species of sea urchin which are split into these orders. Take a look at the breakdown of Echinoidea below.Subclass PerischoechinoideaOrder Cidaroida (pencil urchins)Subclass EuechinoideaSuperorder AtelostomataOrder CassiduloidaOrder Spatangoida (heart urchins)Superorder DiademataceaOrder DiadematoidaOrder EchinothurioidaOrder PedinoidaSuperorder EchinaceaOrder ArbacioidaOrder EchinoidaOrder PhymosomatoidaOrder SalenioidaOrder TemnopleuroidaSuperorder GnathostomataOrder Clypeasteroida (sand dollars)Order Holectypoida\u00a0Sea Urchin SpeciesWith almost 950 sea urchin species in the world, it would be impossible to list of all them here. However, we can take a closer look at some of the most common types of sea urchins, and see which genera and family they belong to.Green sea urchinSuperorder: EchinaceaOrder: EchinoidaFamily: StrongylocentrotidaeGenus: StrongylocentrotusSpecies: Strongylocentrotus droebachiensisThe green sea urchin is commonly found in northern waters all around the world including both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. It resides on rocky substratum in the intertidal and up to depths of 1,150 meters (3,770 ft).This urchin is in the shape of a slightly flattened globe and is named after its striking green color. This is a relatively fast growing sea urchin, and its age is generally calculable based on its size: one year for every 10 mm.The green urchin is edible and is harvested for both locals and for export in. It has been used in fine dining by chefs in the past.Pacific purple sea urchinSuperorder: EchinaceaOrder: EchinoidaFamily: StrongylocentrotidaeGenus: StrongylocentrotusSpecies: Strongylocentrotus purpuratusThe Pacific purple sea urchin is found along the eastern edge of the Pacific Ocean extending from Ensenada, Mexico, to British Columbia, Canada. It lives in lower inter-tidal and nearshore sub-tidal communities. As its name suggests, it is deep purple in color. This sea urchin can grow to about 10 cm (4 inches) and can live for 70 years.Red sea urchinSuperorder: EchinaceaOrder: EchinoidaFamily: StrongylocentrotidaeGenus: MesocentrotusSpecies: Mesocentrotus franciscanusThe red sea urchin is found in the northeastern Pacific Ocean from Alaska to Baja California. It lives in shallow waters from the low-tide line to greater than 280 m (920 ft) deep, and is typically found on rocky shores sheltered from extreme waves in areas where kelp is available. They live for between 7 to 10 years.This sea urchin varies in color from red to dark burgundy and usually have a diameter of around 18 cm with a spine length of 50 to 75 mm. In fact, they are the largest of all the sea urchins and, in British Columbia, they grow to a diameter of over 180 cm (7 in) with 8 cm (3 in) long spines.Red sea urchins are harvested commercially for their reproductive organs primarily for export to Japan. In California, the industry is regulated by the California Department of Fish and Game for number of licenses, harvesting time, and size.Purple sea urchinSuperorder: EchinaceaOrder: CamarodontaFamily: ParechinidaeGenus: ParacentrotusSpecies: Paracentrotus lividusThe purple sea urchin is found in the Mediterranean Sea and eastern Atlantic Ocean from western Scotland and Ireland to the Azores, Canary Islands and Morocco. It resides just below low water mark at depths down to twenty metres and sometimes also in rock pools.This sea urchin is has a circular, flattened greenish test with a diameter of up to seven centimetres. The spines are are usually purple but are occasionally other colors including dark brown, light brown and olive green.The purple sea urchin has been harvested for export over Croatia, Portugal and Ireland. They are considered a gonads are considered a delicacy in Lebanon, France, Italy, Spain, Malta, and parts of Croatia, most notably on the island of Kor\u010dula.European edible sea urchinSuperorder: EchinaceaOrder: CamarodontaFamily: EchinidaeGenus: EchinusSpecies: Echinus esculentusThe European edible sea urchin, also known as the common sea urchin, is found in coastal areas of western Europe, such as Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Ireland. It resides in areas with hard substrates, down to a depth of 1,200 m (3,900 ft).This sea urchin is reddish or purplish with white tubercles and grows to about ten centimetres in diameter. The spines are blunt ended and usually white with purplish tips.As its name suggests, the European edible sea urchin is eaten as food. The species name esculentus means \u201cedible\u201d. Despite this, esculentus is not among the preferred sea urchin species for consumption, due to its white gonads. Sea urchin species with orange gonads are preferred.It is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List.Lime urchinSuperorder: DiademataceaOrder: DiadematoidaFamily: DiadematidaeGenus: DiademaSpecies: Diadema antillarumThe lime urchin, also known as the black sea urchin or the long-spined sea urchin is found on the coral reefs of the western Atlantic and Caribbean basin. It resides at depths of between 1 to 10 metres.In some tropical areas, this sea urchin one of the most abundant, widespread, and ecologically-important sea urchins. This is because it consumes algae that can otherwise grow to such an extent that it can smother coral reefs.This sea urchin is characterized by its exceptionally long black spines, which can grow to 10 to 12 cm in length, or as long as 30 cm in very large individuals. This is a stark contrast from most sea urchin spices that have spines between 1to 3 cm in length.Common heart urchinSuperorder: AtelostomataOrder: SpatangoidaFamily: LoveniidaeGenus: EchinocardiumSpecies: Echinocardium cordatumThe common heart urchin, also known as the sea potato, has cosmopolitan distribution and is found in sub-tidal regions in the North Eastern Atlantic. It resides at depths of down to 230 metres and lives buried in the sandy sea floor.This sea urchin gets its name from its appearance. It is heart-shaped and covered in a dense mat of furrowed yellowish spines which grow from tubercles and mostly point backwards. The sea potato\u2019s test reaches from six to nine centimetres in length.Collector urchinSuperorder: EchinaceaOrder: CamarodontaFamily: ToxopneustidaeGenus: TripneustesSpecies: Tripneustes gratillaThe collector urchin is found the Indo-Pacific, Hawaii, the Red Sea, and The Bahamas, at depths of 2 to 30 metres (7 to 100 ft). They are named the \u201ccollector urchin\u201d because debris tends to \u201ccollect\u201d on them.These sea urchins are dark in color, usually bluish-purple with white spines, although some individuals have orange spines. This color disappears when the individual dies or is taken out of the ocean, and is difficult to preserve. These sea urchins reach 10 to 15 centimetres (4 to 6 in) in size.Collector urchins are economically important in some parts of the world. They are edible and sometimes exploited by humans, and, as a result, they have become less abundant.Slate pencil urchinSuperorder: EchinaceaOrder: CamarodontaFamily: EchinometridaeGenus: HeterocentrotusSpecies: Heterocentrotus mamillatusThe slate pencil urchin, also known as the red slate pencil urchin, or red pencil urchin, is found throughout the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region (from the east coast of Africa to the Pacific archipelagos), but is especially abundant in Hawaii. It resides in reefs in depths from eight to 25 meters and burrows into hard sediments like limestone, coral, and basalt.This sea urchin gets its name from its spines, which are thicker than most sea urchin spines and resemble a pencil. These spines are rounded to triangular in cross-section and taper towards the tip. The thickness of them allow the urchin to bore into hard substrates and defend itself against predators. The spines can grow as long as 10 cm and have a white ring at their stem and alternating light and dark rings.The slate pencil urchin is a large sea urchin, with some specimens reaching over 8 cm in diameter. Most of these sea urchins are bright red, but brown and purple colorations are also seen, and the spines are often a different color.Black sea urchinSuperorder: EchinaceaOrder: ArbacioidaFamily: ArbaciidaeGenus: ArbaciaSpecies: Arbacia lixulaThe black sea urchin is found on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and Macaronesian Islands (Azores, Madeira, Canary Islands), and less commonly, on the Atlantic coast of Western Africa and the Brazilian coast. It resides in shallow waters, at depths from 0 to 30 m, in rocky shores.These sea urchins are medium-sized and characterized by their deep black color and its hemispherical shape. Its spines are roughly the same size and it has secondary spines.The black sea urchin is often confused with the purple sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus), although the purple sea urchin is never really black.White sea urchinSuperorder: EchinaceaOrder: CamarodontaFamily: ToxopneustidaeGenus: TripneustesSpecies: Tripneustes depressusThe white sea urchin, also known as the sea egg, is found in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean, in Mexico, on the western coast of Central America, in Panama, in Ecuador and around the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands.This sea urchin is the largest sea urchin species in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands with a mean diameter of 11.5 cm (4.5 in). The white sea urchin has a dark black, dark purple or reddish brown color with white spines. It is very similar to the West Indian sea egg (Tripneustes ventricosus) and the collector urchin (Tripneustes gratilla).Sputnik urchinSuperorder: \u2014Order: CidaroidaFamily: CidaridaeGenus: PhyllacanthusSpecies: Phyllacanthus imperialisThe Sputnik urchin, also known as the imperial lance urchin, imperial sea urchin, imperial urchin, pencil sea urchin, lance urchin, knobby sputnik sea urchin, mine urchin, and land mine sea urchin, is found in the Indo-Pacific region.It has a black to brown test and spikes vary in color, although are mostly white. The spikes are very distinctive, being thick and blunt. This urchin grows to around 10 cm.KinaSuperorder: EchinaceaOrder: CamarodontaFamily: EchinometridaeGenus: EvechinusSpecies: Evechinus chloroticusKina is found all around New Zealand in shallow waters around 12 to 14 metres deep. In the north of New Zealand it is found mostly on rocky seafloor areas but also in areas of sandy seafloor. These sea urchins can reach a maximum diameter of 16 to 17 cm. Its spikes are brown, and its test turns from brown to green after it loses its spines.Helmet urchinSuperorder: EchinaceaOrder: CamarodontaFamily: EchinometridaeGenus: ColobocentrotusSpecies: Colobocentrotus atratusThe helmet urchin, also known as the shingle urchin is found on wave-swept intertidal shores in the Indo-West Pacific, particularly on the shores of Hawaii. It is deep maroon color and can grow to the size of a softball.This sea urchin has a very unique appearance, with the upper surface a mosaic of tiny polygonal plates formed from modified spines to form a smooth mosaic. This upper surface is fringed by a ring of large, flattened modified spines. On the underside, there is another ring of smaller flattened spines.The unique shape of the helmet urchin makes them three times as resistant as other species to being washed away by moving water.Burrowing urchinSuperorder: EchinaceaOrder: CamarodontaFamily: EchinometridaeGenus: EchinometraSpecies: Echinometra mathaeiThe burrowing urchin is found on reefs in tropical parts of the Indo-Pacific Ocean, from Madagascar, the East African coast and the Red Sea to Hawaii. It resides at depths down to 139 metres (456 ft).This sea urchin grows to a diameter of around 5 centimetres (2.0 in). The color of this urchin can vary, but the test is usually dark and the spines are either green and purple with purple tips or entirely green with purple tips.Its name comes from its ability to dig itself into the basaltic and calcareous rock where it lives. Because of its burrowing activities, it causes bioerosion of coral reefs.Flower urchinSuperorder: EchinaceaOrder: CamarodontaFamily: ToxopneustidaeGenus: ToxopneustesSpecies: Toxopneustes pileolusThe flower urchin are widespread and common in the tropical Indo-West Pacific. They reside among coral reefs, coral rubble, rocks, sand, and seagrass beds at depths of 0 to 90 m (0 to 295 ft).These sea urchins are relatively large sea urchins and can reach a maximum diameter of around 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 in). Their test has five segments separated from each other by five other segments. The test varies in color, usually a deep red and grey, though there are rare instances of green and pale purple.The most striking feature of the flower urchin, and the reason for its name, is its pedicellariae (stalked grasping appendages). Flower urchins possess four types of pedicellariae, one of which, the globiferous pedicellariae, resembles flowers. These help to defend the sea urchin from predators and are pinkish-white to yellowish-white in color with a central purple dot and a bright white rim.The flower urchin is considered highly dangerous, as it is capable of delivering extremely painful and medically significant stings when touched.Violet sea urchinSuperorder: EchinaceaOrder: TemnopleuroidaFamily: ToxopneustidaeGenus: SphaerechinusSpecies: Sphaerechinus granularisThe violet sea urchin is found in the Mediterranean Sea and the eastern Atlantic Ocean, from the Channel Islands south to Cape Verde and the Gulf of Guinea. It lives on rocks covered with seaweed or gravelly substrates.This sea urchin is a large sea urchin that can grow up to 15 centimeters in diameter. Its test is flattened and it has spines that are short and blunt, all the same length, and arranged neatly in rows. There are two distinct color forms; the test is purple in both but one has purple spines and the other white.The gonads of the violet sea urchin are considered a delicacy in Italy, Provence and Catalonia.Fire urchinSuperorder: DiademataceaOrder: DiadematoidaFamily: DiadematidaeGenus: AstropygaSpecies: Astropyga radiataThe fire urchin, also known as the red urchin, false fire urchin or blue-spotted urchin, is found in the tropical Indo-Pacific region, at a maximum depth of about 70 metres (230 ft) but more normally at 10 to 30 metres (33 to 98 ft). It lives in sand, shingle or coral rubble substrate.It has a test diameter of up to 20 cm (8 in) and the spines are up to 4 cm (1.6 in) long. V-shaped areas on this urchin are red with lines of iridescent blue dots while the color of the rest of the test and spines varies from reddish brown to purple, dark brown or nearly black.These urchin\u2019s quills are quite venomous although not deadly to humans. Thanks to its bright color, this urchin is visible to divers.Common sand dollarSuperorder: GnathostomataOrder: ClypeasteroidaFamily: EchinarachniidaeGenus: EchinarachniusSpecies: Echinarachnius parmaThe common sand dollar is found in the North Pacific and Northwest Atlantic, on the North American east coast from New Jersey north, as well as in Alaska, Siberia, British Columbia, and Japan. It inhabits isolated areas on sandy bottoms below the low tide level down to a depth of 5,000 feet (1,500 m).Sand dollars are species of flat, burrowing sea urchins. They are closely related to sea cucumbers and starfish and have a hard outer shell, which is covered in very fine hairs.The common sand dollar is round, flat and disc-like, typically measuring 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter. Their color is a purplish brown, becoming bleached white when washed ashore. They are often taken from beaches as souvenirs.There are three subspecies of the common sand dollar.Banded sea urchinSuperorder: DiademataceaOrder: DiadematoidaFamily: DiadematidaeGenus: EchinothrixSpecies: Echinothrix calamarisThe banded sea urchin, also known as the double spined urchin is found throughout the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region, from eastern coast of Africa to French Polynesia, including Hawaii and the Red Sea. It resides between the surface and a depth of 70 meters (230 ft) and and can be found in lagoons, external reef slopes and channels.This sea urchin has a slightly oval test that reaches a diameter of 5 cm. It has two different sets of spines; shorter and slender closed spines which go from yellow to dark in color and can deliver a nasty sting, and longer and thicker spines that are often banded with light and dark color, that can reach 10 to 15 cm in length.A dark form of this sea urchin is reported in Indian Ocean, which is often not banded and has a green sheen and a more or less reddish test.\u00a0"

There are 10 genera of gulls, and they are most closely related to the terns (family Sternidae) and only distantly related to auks, skimmers and even more distantly to waders. Gull have a worldwide cosmopolitan distribution and breed on every continent. Most gull species are migratory, with birds moving to warmer habitats during the winter. They are medium to large birds, usually gray or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. These birds are highly adaptable feeders that opportunistically take a wide range of prey, including fish, marine and freshwater invertebrates, rodents, amphibians, reptiles and plant materials. They live in colonies, especially during the mating season. Breeding pairs mostly stick to their own territory and defend it against intruders. Gulls are monogamous and mate for life.",
            "lifespan": "Seagulls have a pretty long lifespan, with most species living up to 30 years old. Some can live longer though, and some have been known to live to 49 years old!",

The most common foods they eat are fish, marine and freshwater invertebrates, arthropods, insects, rodents, eggs, carrion, offal, reptiles and amphibians. They will also eat plant items and human refuse.The gull diet has shifted due to overfishing from humans. Research has shown that overfishing has caused gulls to prey more on crustaceans rather than fish such as sardines.Not only are they adaptable feeders, but they are also adaptable in the way they catch their prey. Gulls feed in the air, on water, or on land. They have only a limited ability to dive below the water to feed on deeper prey, and will much more often hunt for prey when marine hunters, such as orcas and gray whales, drive prey to the surface.Gulls can be very clever feeders. If they have caught a clam or mussel and cannot open the hard shell, they will fly some distance to find a suitable surface on which to drop shells and crack them open to eat the inside. They have also been known to follow ploughs in fields where they know upturned grubs and other food sources will be plentiful.Seagulls can drink both fresh and salt water. Most animals are unable to do this, but seagulls have a special pair of glands right above their eyes which is specifically designed to flush the salt from their systems through openings in the bill.",

They are vocal communicators that use several distinct calls to demonstrate aggression, identify mating partners, warn the colony of a threat, and resolve a territorial dispute. Baby chicks will also use calls to beg for food from their parents.Seagulls show ease when swimming, flying, and walking. They are better adapted to walking on land than most other seabirds, and the smaller gulls tend to be more manoeuvrable while walking. Gulls walk in a side to side motion. When flying, they are able to hover and they are also able to take off quickly with little space.Gulls are very intelligent animals. They display this intelligence when it comes to feeding, as they drop hard-shelled molluscs onto rocks so that they break open so they can eat them. They\u2019ll also stamp their feet in a group to imitate rainfall and trick earthworms to come to the surface. Another example of intelligence is behavior of hovering over bridges in order to absorb raising heat from paved roadways.",
            "reproduction": "Gulls are monogamous and mate for life. Their breeding season usually occurs in the early springtime after returning to the same site from their annual migration. They return to the same colony, which can vary from just a few pairs of gulls to over a hundred thousand pairs, and may be exclusive to that gull species or shared with other seabird species.Within their colonies, breeding pairs are very territorial. Gulls will defend their territories from rivals of both sexes through calls and aerial attacks. Most seagulls build their nest in a hollow depression on the ground (and sometimes cliffs) out of vegetation, feathers, rope, and even plastic. The nest is usually located next to a rock, log, or bush to protect it from predators. The building of the nest is part of the pair-bonding.After mating, the female usually lays three eggs, although it can be less for smaller species. The eggs are usually dark tan to brown or dark olive with dark splotches and scrawl markings. Both the male and the female incubate the eggs, which lasts for around 22 and 26 days and starts after the laying the first egg. This means that the the first two chicks are born close together, and the third chick some time later.The young gulls are brooded by their parents for about one or two weeks, and often at least one parent remains with them to guard them until they fledge. Both parents take on feeding duties, although early on the male does most of the feeding and the female does of the brooding and guarding of the chicks.Many young chicks have a mottled brown appearance compared with the more solid colors of the adult plumage. Young gulls form nursery flocks where they will play and learn vital skills for adulthood. Nursery flocks are watched over by a few adult males and these flocks will remain together until the birds are old enough to breed. They reach sexual maturity within a few years.",
            "location and habitat": "Gulls are found all over the world and have cosmopolitan distribution. They breed on every continent. Seagulls are mostly found in colonies close to ocean habitats, although some birds will travel far inland in the non-breeding season.These birds are migratory and move to warmer habitats during the winter. Some migrate very long distances, while others migrate much shorter distances. The biggest impact on their migration behavior is food.\u00a0Seagull Conservation StatusMost species of seagull are considered to be Least Concern by the IUCN Red List, although there are some species that are threatened. It is thought the seagull population is declining, and this is likely due to climate change, loss of habitat, pollution and overfishing. Plastic pollution is of most concern, as it is thought that many are regularly consuming plastic waste left by humans on beaches.In the United States, gulls are protected birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. In the UK, they are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act. This means that in both these countries it is illegal to hunt these birds.",
            "predators": "Adult seagulls have few predators, although they can occasionally be preyed on by sharks, eagles, falcons and hawks. Young seagulls and gull eggs are most likely to be preyed on, and can be taken by raccoons, minks, foxes, cats, and birds of prey.To scare off predators, groups of seagulls will go after the predator and use their feet and wings to bat them away.Seagull FAQ\u2019sAre seagulls and gulls the same animal?Seagulls and gulls are the same. In fact, the term \u201cseagull\u201d is a colloquial term. It is not used by ornithologists and biologists.Why can seagulls drink both freshwater and saltwater?Seagulls can drink both freshwater and saltwater because they have special pair of glands right above their eyes which is specifically designed to flush the salt from their systems through openings in the bill, which helps to assist the kidneys in maintaining electrolyte balance.Can seagulls hurt humans?Seagulls are very strong birds, and have been known to hurt both humans and animals. While they are not aggressive animals, they can \u201cattack\u201d humans when trying to take food. They take our food because they have lost their fear of humans, and have realised that we are easy source of food!Are seagulls migratory?Gulls are migratory. They move to warmer areas during the winter. The distance they travel depends on the species \u2014 some travel very far, while others just disperse around the breeding grounds.\u00a0Seagull SpeciesGulls belong to the family Laridae.

The Secretary bird has a small head with small eyes and a hooked beak. Its plumage is a light bluish/grey and it has a red colored face. Flight feathers are black and they have black feathers on the thighs and on the back of their heads. Their legs are long and powerful and are used for striking and pursuing prey.Secretary birds have 2 central elongated feathers on their tail which extend beyond their feet when in flight. They have tough scales on their legs to help protect their legs from snake bites. Secretary birds do not have grasping toes like other birds of prey, instead their toes are thick and blunt with short curved talons on the ends. Both male and female are similar in appearance.",
            "habitat": "Secretary birds prefer open grasslands, steppe and tree-dotted savannas. They live in areas where grass is fairly short so they can see prey more easier as they walk along. They build large nests in Acacia trees or thorn trees made from long, flat twigs and grass and can measure 8 feet wide and 1 foot deep. Nests grow larger year by year. Nests are returned to just before dark to roost in over night after a days hunting on the ground. Secretary birds avoid forests and dense shrubberies as they might restrict their movement.",
            "diet": "Secretary birds are diurnal carnivorous raptors who feed up on a variety of prey. They are famous for their ability to kill snakes on the African grasslands. The secretary bird may travel over 30 kilometres a day in search of snakes, insects and other animals. They feed up on snakes such as Adders and even Cobras but will also consume lizards, amphibians, rodents and birds eggs. Small animals are eaten whole, however, larger prey is stamped to death before being consumed.Dangerous prey, such as snakes, are first stamped on to stun them and then pecked behind their neck to kill them. The secretary bird also stamps on the ground with its large stout-toed feet to flush prey out of hiding.",
            "behaviour": "Secretary birds are territorial and occupy areas of around 40 \u2013 50 square kilometres. Although the secretary bird is a good flyer, it spends most of its time on the ground. It flies well but needs a long take-off run prior to leaving the ground. Secretary birds mate for life and although out of breeding season they can be solitary, the other half of a pair is usually not far away. Secretary birds are silent nearly all of the time. The only sound they make is a croaking sound when displaying for a mate.",
            "reproduction": "Courtship includes a mutual display of chasing each other with wings spread up and backwards much like they perform when chasing ground prey. Mating takes place either on the ground or in their large nests up high in Acacia trees. The female lays 2 \u2013 3 oval, pale green eggs over a period of 2 \u2013 3 days. The rough textured eggs are incubated by the female for 45 \u2013 50 days.Young secretary birds have yellow skin on their faces and a downy plumage. They are fed regurgitated food from their parents. The young can flap their wings at 60 days old and fledge around 80 days old.

            "desc": "Rainforest Serval The Serval (Leptailurus serval) is a medium-sized African wild cat. It is closely related to the African Golden Cat and the Caracal. The Serval is generally found in most parts of Africa excluding the arid desert regions to the north around the Sahara, parts of the western tip of Southern Africa and certain areas of the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. A northern sub-species is rarely sighted and is listed as endangered. \u00a0",
            "characteristics": "The Serval grows to be 85 centimetres (34 inches) in length and has a tail length of 40 centimetres (16 inches). Their shoulder height is about 53 centimetres (21 inches). Their weight can range from 9 to 20 kilograms (20 \u2013 44 pounds). The Serval is a slender animal, with long legs and a fairly short tail.Their longish oval ears are set close together. The pattern of their fur is variable. Melanism (an increased amount of black or nearly black pigmentation) is known to exist in this species, giving a similar appearance to the black panther. White servals are white with silvery grey spots and have only occur in captivity.Servals have relatively the largest ears and the longest legs in the cat family. Their feet are actually elongated rather than their legs. They have long necks and their heads are small and slim. Their coat is tawny-gold in color and marked with round black spots.Generally the spots are large and they tend to merge into longitudinal stripes on the neck and back. Sometimes there are numerous small spots, giving a speckled appearance.The tail of the serval is short, down to the hocks. It is tipped with black and is spotted and ringed. A servals ears are black with central white bars. Their skulls are distinctly elongated and the upper anterior premolars are present.\u00a0",
            "diet": "Although the Serval is highly specialised for catching rodents, it is an opportunistic predator whose diet also includes hares, hyraxes, birds (quails, flamingoes, quelea and teal), reptiles, insects, fish and frogs.The Serval has been observed taking larger animals, such as small antelopes, however, over 90% of the Servals prey weighs less than 200 grams (7 ounces). The Serval eats very quickly and if its food is big enough, it sometimes eats too quickly, causing it to regurgitate the food because of clogging in the throat.\u00a0",
            "habitat": "Serval cats range from dry open grasslands to woodland savanna and even to the moister areas around the equatorial rainforests.The Servals main habitat is the savanna, although melanistic individuals are more usually found in mountainous areas. The Serval needs water courses within its territory, so it does not live in semi-deserts. It is able to climb and swim, but seldom does so.The Serval has now reduced in numbers due to human population taking over its habitat and also hunting for its pelt. It is not necessarily now threatened with extinction, however, it may come to that unless trade is closely controlled.Servals are found in well-watered savannah long-grass environments and are associated with reed beds. They occupy a variety of habitats all associated with water sources, they range up into alpine grasslands and can penetrate deep dense forests along waterways and through grassy patches. They will make use of arid areas in extreme instances and have occasionally done so in parts of south-western Africa.\u00a0",
            "behaviour": "As part of its adaptations for hunting in the savannas, the Serval boasts long legs (the longest of all cats, relative to body size) and large ears. The long legs and neck allow the Serval to see over tall grasses, while its ears are used to detect rodents, even those burrowing underground.While hunting, the Serval will pause for up to 15 minutes at a time to listen with eyes closed. The Servals pounce is a distinctive vertical \u2018hop\u2019, which may be an adaptation for catching flushed birds.The Serval is a highly efficient hunter, catching prey on as many as 50% of attempts, compared to around one of ten for most species of cat. The Serval may also dig into burrows and fish the unlucky inhabitants out.Servals walk slowly through tall grass and listen for movement, if it is windy they wait. They leap high with all four feet off the ground. Their prey is stunned or killed as the cat hits them with its forefeet.If the serval misses it makes a series of swift, successive stiff-legged jumps in attempt to remedy the situation. Servals also use a high bouncing pounce to flush animals from cover, galloping zig-zag fashion through the grass with high leaps.Female servals hold exclusive territories from about two to nine kilometres squared. Male ranges are usually twice the size and will overlap two or more female territories. Boundaries are marked with frequent scent and scrape marks.Male servals have been observed to display very ritualistic aggressive behaviour. They sit and face one another as one individual puts his front paw on the others chest. The second animal bobs his head and may bite the upraised paw. This exchange can escalate into a full fight, however, more often remains as a protracted stare-off.Adult male servals have been observed to display some social behaviour, by resting together during the day.Servals in the Ngorongoro are mainly nocturnal, this reflects the activity peaks of their main prey species. In the Serengeti they tend to be more diurnal as the basic prey are Nile rats, which are active in the day.\u00a0",
            "reproduction": "The gestation period for a female Serval is 66 \u2013 77 days, almost 3 months. The litter consists of 2 or 3 young (called kittens), sometimes as few as one or as many as 5. The kittens Weigh around 260 grams at birth, their eyes are fully open by nine days.They are raised in sheltered locations like abandoned aardvark burrows. If such an ideal location is not available, a place behind a shrub may be sufficient. By four weeks the kittens have their first solids and are weaned in 4 to 7 months.

            "s as pets": "In recent years, servals have become popular as\u00a0pets\u00a0in North America and Europe. While these beautiful cats can make great companions, there are also some important things to consider before bringing one into your home.There are a few things you should consider before getting a serval cat. First, be sure you have enough space to provide for the cat\u2019s needs. Servals need plenty of room to roam and explore, and small home or apartment will not be suitable.Second, servals are not domesticated animals. This means they have not been bred over generations to live peacefully with humans.Servals are wild animals, and their instinct is to hunt and kill.This can pose a danger to small children and other pets in your home. Even if a serval has been raised in captivity, it is still a wild animal and may become aggressive if it feels threatened.Servals can\u2019t be litter box trained, so you\u2019ll need to provide a large, outdoor enclosure for your cat. This type of setup is not suitable for everyone, and it can be expensive to maintain.Servals can jump very high and dig very deep, so the enclosure will need to be escape-proof.If a Serval were to escape its enclosure it would pose a serious threat to wild and domestic animals such as pets or\u00a0farm animals. This would mean that farmers or animal control would use lethal force on a roaming Serval.\u00a0Serval Conservation StatusThe Serval is sometimes preyed upon by the Leopard and other large cats. The serval is reasonably widespread and relatively common throughout Africa. It also breeds well in captivity.The IUCN Red List has the North African serval as Endangered but all other servals as Least Concern.Servals are reputed to be easy to hunt and will run up a tree if chased by dogs. Then they can be easily shot. The principle threats they face in the rest of their ranges are habitat loss and persecution (Serval Research in South Africa.Servals are believed to be responsible for sheep and poultry losses. Blackbacked jackal and caracal are more likely to be the culprits. Servals also get trapped easily. It is unfortunate for the serval that it has such beautiful fur. People still demand the skins of spotted cats.\u00a0",

            "desc": "In some shape or form, Sharks have been around for about 400 million years. Even before dinosaurs roamed the earth, sharks hunted through our oceans and even in some rivers and lakes. Sharks are such good survivors that they have had little need to evolve in the last 150 million years. ",
            "diet": "Normally, sharks eat alone. However, sometimes one feeding shark attracts others. They swim up as quickly as possible and all begin to try to get a piece of the prey. Sharks bite wildly at anything that gets in their way, even each other. Almost all sharks are carnivores or meat eaters. Sharks live on a diet of fish and sea mammals (like dolphins and seals) and even such prey as turtles and seagulls.Sharks even eat other sharks. For example, a Tiger Shark might eat a Bull Shark, a Bull Shark might eat a Blacktip Shark and a Blacktip Shark might eat a Dogfish Shark. It is a bit of a \u2018shark eat shark\u2019 life beneath the waves.They are not all fierce carnivores. Some are quite harmless. Strangely enough, the most harmless sharks tend to be the largest sharks. The Basking Shark, the Whale Shark and the Megamouth Sharks all fit this description. These huge sharks eat plankton, a tiny shrimp-like creature found in the ocean. To do this, they swim forward with their mouths wide open. \u2018Gill rakers\u2019 at the back of their throat strain the tiny food from the water and is called filter feeding (as mentioned above).",
            "reproduction": "Male and female sharks can easily be identified. Males sharks have modified pelvic fins which have become a pair of claspers. The name is somewhat misleading as they are not used to hold on to the female, but fulfil the role of the mammalian penis. During mating the more flexible sharks wrap around each other, the male usually curling around the female. In less flexible sharks the male and female float parallel with each other while the male inserts a clasper into the females oviduct (the passage from the ovaries to the outside of the body).Female sharks in many of the larger species have bite marks that appear to be a result of a male grasping them to maintain position during mating. The bite marks may also come from courtship behaviour: the male may bite the female to show his interest. In some species, females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites.Sharks have a different reproductive strategy than most fishes. Sharks do not mass produce, instead they have between 1 \u2013 100 pups at a time. Blue Sharks have been recorded to have had 135 offspring whereas some sharks have as little as two. No shark species are known to provide post-natal parental protection for their young, but females have a hormone that is released into their blood during the pupping season that apparently keeps them from feeding on their young.There are three ways a shark pup can be born:Oviparity \u2013 Some sharks lay eggs. In most of these species, the developing embryo is protected by an egg case with the consistency of leather. Sometimes these cases are corkscrewed into crevices for protection. Sometimes the egg cases are washed up onto the beach and are known as \u2018the Mermaids Purse. Sharks that give birth this way include: the Horn Shark, Catshark, Port Jackson Shark, and the Swellshark.Viviparity \u2013 These sharks maintain a placental link to the developing young, more similar to mammalian gestation than that of other fishes. The young are born alive and fully functional. Hammerheads, the Requiem Sharks such as the Bull Shark and the Tiger Sharks, the Basking Shark and the Smooth Dogfish fall into this category. Dogfish have the longest known gestation period of any shark, at 18 to 24 months. Basking Sharks and Frilled Sharks are likely to have even longer gestation periods.Ovoviviparity \u2013 This is the most common method used by sharks. The young are nourished by the yolk of their egg and by fluids secreted by glands in the walls of the oviduct. The eggs hatch within the oviduct and the young continue to be nourished by the remaining parts of the yolk and the oviducts fluids. As in viviparity, the young are born alive and fully functional. Most ovoviviparous sharks give birth in sheltered areas, including bays, river mouths and shallow reefs. They choose such areas because of the protection from predators (mainly other sharks) and the abundance of food.",
            "tails": "Shark tails (caudal fins) vary considerably between species and are adapted to the lifestyle of the shark. Their tail provides thrust and so speed and acceleration is dependent on tail shape. Different tail shapes have evolved in sharks adapted for different environments. The Tiger Sharks tail has a large upper lobe which delivers the maximum amount of power for slow cruising or sudden bursts of speed.The Tiger Shark has a varied diet and because of this it must be able to twist and turn in the water easily when hunting, whereas the Porbeagle shark, which hunts schooling fishes such as mackerel and herring has a large lower lobe to provide greater speed to help it keep pace with its fast-swimming preySome tail adaptations have purposes other than providing thrust. The Cookiecutter Shark has a tail with broad lower and upper lobes of similar shape which are luminescent and may help to lure prey towards the shark. The Thresher shark feeds on fish and squid, which it is believed to herd, then stun with its powerful and elongated upper lobe.Shark ConservationThe majority of shark fisheries around the globe have little monitoring or management. With the rise in demand of shark products there is a greater pressure on fisheries. Stocks decline and collapse because because sharks are long-lived apex predators with comparatively small populations, which makes it difficult for them breed rapidly enough to maintain population levels. Major declines in shark stocks have been recorded in recent years \u2013 some species have been depleted by over 90% over the past 20 \u2013 30 years with a population decline of 70% not being unusual.Many governments and the UN have acknowledged the need for shark fisheries management, but due to the low economic value of shark fisheries, the small volumes of products produced and the poor public image of sharks, little progress has been made. Many other threats to sharks include habitat alteration, damage and loss from coastal developments, pollution and the impact of fisheries on the seabed and prey species.Related Post \u2013 Shark Behaviour\u00a0"

            "desc": "Domestic sheep (Ovis aries) are quadrupedal, ruminant mammals kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are even-toed ungulates, also commonly called cloven-hoofed animals. Although the name \u2018sheep\u2019 applies to many species, in everyday usage it almost always refers to Ovis aries. Domestic sheep are the most numerous species in their genus and are most likely descended from the wild mouflon of Europe and Asia. Today, there are about one billion sheep on the planet and around 900 different breeds, many of these sub-classable. Female sheep are called Ewes. Intact males are called Rams. Castrated males are called Wethers. Year old sheep are called Hoggets. Baby sheep are called Lambs A group of sheep is referred to as a mob or a flock. Different breeds of sheep are bred for particular purposes such as wool and meat. Others are bred for their different types of milk. Some breeds produce thicker milk which is ideal for making ice cream.",
            "behaviour": "Domestic Sheep exhibit a strong flocking behaviour. Sheep do not like to be alone, that is why the flock together in large or small groups.In a flock of grazing sheep there is little or no sign of dominance. In small domestic flocks, sheep will compete for small amounts of food by pushing and shoving rather than active bunting. Flocking behaviour is an advantage to non-predatory animals. The strongest animals fight their way to the centre of the flock which offers them greater protection from predators. It can also be a disadvantage when food sources are limited and sheep are almost as prone to overgrazing a pasture as goats.Different sheep breeds have different flocking structures for example:Merinos are a tightly knit flock and very rarely form sub-groups. They graze close to each other and disperse into sub-groups only under extreme food shortage, when gender and age groups segregate out.Southdowns usually form a few sub-groups and are closely associated when grazing, but not when camping.Dorset Horns always form many sub-groups.Flocking behaviours in English breeds of sheep can be prevalent. Because these behaviours are very noticeable, sheep breeders have even given them names. A sheep that roams away from the flock is called an \u2018Outlier\u2019. This sheep will venture away from the safety of the flock to graze elsewhere. This is probably because it has a weakness that prevents it from gaining enough forage when with the other sheep.Another sheep, the \u2018Bellwether\u2019, leads the others. Traditionally this was a castrated Ram (or wether) with a bell hung off a string around its neck. The tendency to act as an outlier, bellwether or to fight for the middle of the flock stays with sheep throughout their adulthood.",
            "diet and digestion": "Grazing is a social behaviour like sheltering and camping. Domestic Sheep tend to have two main grazing periods, during the early morning and again late in the afternoon. The early morning grazing time tends to be a lesser active grazing time than the later period. Grazing time in total can last from 5 \u2013 10 hours per day depending on breed of sheep and available pasture and water.Sheep are exclusively herbivorous mammals. Like all ruminants, sheep have a complex digestive system composed of four chambers, allowing them to break down cellulose from stems, leaves and seed hulls into simpler carbohydrates. When sheep graze, vegetation is chewed into a mass called a bolus, which is then passed into the first chamber: the rumen.The bolus is periodically regurgitated back to the mouth as cud for additional chewing and salivation. Cud chewing is an adaptation allowing ruminants to graze more quickly in the morning and then fully chew and digest feed later in the day. This is beneficial as grazing, which requires lowering the head, leaves sheep vulnerable to predators, while cud chewing does not.During fermentation, the rumen produces gas that must be expelled. After fermentation in the rumen, food passes in to the reticulum and the omasum, special feeds such as grains may bypass the rumen altogether. Following the first three chambers, food moves in to the abomasum for final digestion before processing by the intestines. The abomasum is the only one of the three chambers analogous to the human stomach (being the only one that absorbs nutrients for use as energy) and is sometimes called the \u2018true stomach\u2019.Sheep need plenty of water, they also prefer to drink from running water such as brooks and streams rather than still sources. Sheep also require clean water and may refuse to drink water that is covered in scum or algae.",
            "milk and wool": "Different breeds of sheep are bred specifically for the type of wool and milk they produce as well as being a valuable source of meat.",
            "s wool": "Spinning wool into yarn began about 5,000 years ago. One pound of wool can make 10 miles of yarn. One years growth of fleece, makes around 8 pounds of wool. Fleeces of British sheep can be classified into three main types: carpet wools, down wools and long wools each with differing end uses.Domestic Sheep are either sheared in the early summer months, or immediately prior to winter housing. Since sheep breeds no longer naturally molt, shearing is necessary to prevent the animal from overheating either when indoors, or outside during hot summer months. When shorn, sheep are also much less prone to fly strike.Shearing is usually carried out by shearers from Australia and New Zealand who travel the world to shear sheep all year round. This \u2018shearing circuit\u2019 is seen as a way to save money to start farming. Once a sheep has been shorn, the fleece is rolled up and tied with its own wool. It is then put into wool sacks and then collected. It is then cleaned, dyed, combed and spun into yarn in which clothes and carpets are made from it. The sheep are then nice a cool in the summer and their fleece can begin to freshly grow again.",
            "s milk": "The milk that sheep produce is both nutritious and delicious. The milk has a rich, bland, slightly sweet taste. It is much higher in total solids than either cow or goat milk and contains up to twice as many of the minerals like calcium, phosphorus and zinc and the all important B group Vitamins. It is sold both fresh and frozen in pint or 500ml packs and keeps well for at least 4 months in a deep freeze.Below is a comparative analysis of sheep, goat and cows milk:Whole Milk %SheepGoatCowTotal Solids18.311.212.1Fat6.73.93.5Protein5.62.93.4Lactose4.84.14.5Calorific value /100g1027773Vitamins mg/l\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Riboflavin B24.31.42.2Thiamine1.20.50.5Niacin B15.42.51.0Pantothenic acid5.33.63.4B60.70.60.5Folic acid ug/l0.50.060.5B120.090.0070.03Biotin5.04.01.7Minerals mg/100g\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Calcium (Ca)162 - 259102 - 203110Phosphorus (P)82 - 18386 - 11890Sodium (Na)41 - 13235 - 6558Magnesium (Mg)14 - 1913 - 1911Zinc (Zn)0.5 - 1.20.19 - 0.50.3Iron (Fe)0.03 - 0.10.01 - 0.10.04Even if people are severely lactose intolerant, the lactose will have been converted into lactic acid if they take their sheep milk in the form of yogurt and much of the lactose goes out with the whey in hard cheese making.

Sheep cannot get themselves back upright from that position and if left for too long it will unfortunately, eventually die!",
            "reproduction": "Sheep follow a similar reproductive strategy to other herd animals. A flock of ewes is generally mated by a single ram, who has either been chosen by a farmer or has established dominance through physical contest with other rams (in feral populations).

They prefer the dense and close canopy of undisturbed primary forest. They inhabit deeply hidden portions of the rainforests, climbing trees skillfully and swinging through the forests. Silvery Gibbons travel in small family groups that consist of a mated pair and their offspring in various stages of development.Silvery gibbons are not found in mangrove rainforest, or above 4,800 feet (1600 metres) above sea level.",
            "behaviour": "Silvery Gibbons travel by swinging from branch to branch, using their long fingers to hook the branches as they swing forward for the next branch. At times, their swings are so powerful that it allows them to be completely airborne and reach greater distances in one swing.They are able to walk on the ground if they need to and they can walk on two legs, holding their arms up above their heads to help balance. In each familys territory, there are trees that are used for specific purposes, like sleeping and calling. They repeatedly use the same trees for these activities.Every morning, the female Silvery Gibbon will arise and announce her presence to the forest by shrieking and calling. These calls can be heard for at least one kilometre in all directions.",
            "reproduction": "Silvery gibbons, like most gibbon species, are monogamous and mate for life. There is no breeding season and a female will come into oestrus at any time of the year. The female will produce offspring about every 2 to 3 years. Gestation usually lasts 7 to 8 months and only one baby gibbon is born at a time. The infant is hairless with only some fluff on its head.It is kept close to its mother for warmth and nursed for about a year. The infant lives with the family group until it is fully mature at about 8 years and until they are ready to go off on their own and find a mate. Gibbon families are usually very closely linked and they stay close together when traveling. If threatened in their territories, the gibbon female will sing and scream while the male chases off the intruder, usually with a lot of noise and crashing through branches.\u00a0Silvery Gibbon Conservation StatusThe Silvery Gibbon (Hylobates moloch) is currently listed as Critically Endangered on the 2007 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Habitat destruction on densely populated Java continues to reduce the natural range of the species. Many gibbons are also lost to the illegal pet trade, when adult gibbons are slaughtered so that their babies can be sold in the markets as pets.It is estimated that only 4% of their original native habitat is still available to the species. They are, of course, in danger from poachers who sell their meat, pelts and take the babies for pets. Several zoos operate Silvery Gibbon breeding programs. Despite these efforts, the future survival of this species is in question.\u00a0"

Its nearest relatives are the Recluse spiders (Loxosceles) which are found worldwide. The Six Eyed Sand Spider is also known as the six-eyed crab spider due to its flattened stance and laterigrade legs. The venom of this spiders bite is said to be the most dangerous on record. Over 38,000 species of Six Eyed Sand Spider have been identified, however, because of their great ability for hiding, it is believed that about 200,000 species exist. ",
            "characteristics": "The Six Eyed Sand Spider is covered in small hairs, called setae (a stiff hair, bristle or bristle-like process or part of an organism), which serve to hold particles of sand. This provides effective camouflage even when the spider is not buried.The Six Eyed Sand Spider has a body length up to 0.6 inches (15 millimetres) and the width across the legs is about 2 inches (50 millimetres). Most species are reddish-brown to yellow in color without any distinct patterns. Six Eyed Sand Spiders often camouflage themselves with sand particles wedged between body hairs in order to blend into the background of their specific habitat. The Six Eyed Sand Spiders are shy and secretive, however, they will bite when accidentally contacted.",
            "habitat and webs": "The Six Eyed Sand Spider lives in the desert and hunts by ambush rather than by spinning a web. Unlike most ambush hunters like the Trapdoor spider, Mouse spider or Funnel-web spider, it does not dig a burrow. Instead, it buries itself just under the surface of the sand.",
            "diet": "The Six Eyed Sand Spider does not roam in search of prey, it simply lies in wait for an insect or scorpion to pass by. When one does, it seizes the prey with its front legs, kills it with venom and eats it. The Six Eyed Sand Spiders do not need to feed very often, an adult Six Eyed Sand Spider can live without food or water for a very long time.",
            "reproduction": "Spiders reproduce by eggs laid in silk bundles called egg sacs. Spiders often use elaborate mating rituals (especially in the visually advanced jumping spiders) to allow the male to approach close enough to inseminate the female without triggering a predatory response. Assuming that the approach signals are exchanged correctly, the male spider must make a timely departure after mating to escape before the female eats them.",
            "venom": "Fortunately, this spider, like the Recluse spider, is very shy. However, toxicology studies have shown that this spiders venom is the most venomous of any spider.There is some question as to the danger posed by this spider. It is very shy and unlikely to bite humans and there are few (if any) recorded human envenoms by this species. However, toxicology studies have demonstrated that the venom is particularly potent, with a powerful haemolytic (the breaking open of red blood cells and the release of haemoglobin into the surrounding fluid) and necrotic (accidental death of cells and living tissue) effect, causing blood vessel leakage and tissue destruction.Unlike the dangerous neurotoxic spiders (the Widow spiders, the Funnel-web spider and the Brazilian Wandering spiders), no antivenom currently exists for the bite of this spider, leading many to suspect that a bite by this spider is likely to produce a fatality.There are no confirmed bites in man and only two suspected ones. However, in one of these cases, the victim lost an arm to massive necrosis and in the other, the victim died of massive haemorrhaging, similar to the effects of a Rattlesnake bite.The Six Eyed Sand Spider rarely comes into contact with people and even when it does, it generally never bites. Further, like most spiders, it does not always inject venom with every bite, nor, even when it does, does it necessarily inject a large amount."

They eat a lot of noxious insects, such as toxic beetles and roaches, and will then engage in urine washing, rubbing urine over their hands, feet and face, which is thought to soothe or defend against the sting of these toxic insects.These animals mainly feed alone, but sometimes males and females forage in pairs, too. They have a highly developed sense of smell, which they use to locate insect prey in the dark. They catch their prey using a \u2018sneak, spring, and grab\u2019 method: they stalk along a branch, slowly approaching an insect and when they get close, they crouch and leap suddenly, grabbing the animal or insect.To maximize protein and nutrient intake, slender lorises consume every part of their prey, including the scales and bones.",
            "behavior": "The slender loris is a nocturnal animal and spends most of it\u2019s day curled up in a ball sleeping, in the crook of a branch or in a hollow tree. While they usually forage alone and are quite solitary animals, they sleep in groups of\u00a0 2\u20134, usually with a mate or an infant. They are most active at dusk and dawn, playing, wrestling and grooming each other. The red slender loris is one of the most social of the nocturnal primates.While these animals will occasionally forage together in social groups, males will not tolerate the presence of other males in their territory. Individuals communicate using urine scent marks, claiming territory or advertising their reproductive status to others.These animals move slowly with deliberate hand-over-hand movements. They like to travel along the top of branches. They are capable of moving quickly if alarmed, but they do not jump or leap. If threatened, they will usually freeze and remain motionless until the danger has passed. If this fails, they will stare at their attacker and growl while emitting an unpleasant odor from scent glands under their arms.",
            "reproduction": "Mating occurs twice a year for slender lorises, once in April-May and once in October-November. During mating season, the female is in estrus for a period of 29-40 days. During mating, the female hangs from a branch by all four limbs and will completely support the male\u2019s weight, in addition to her own.The gestation period is between 166-169 days long and normally one infant is born, although sometimes two. Gray slender lorises will often bear twins but the survival rate is low.Newborn infants are born pink and almost entirely furless. They cling to the mother\u2019s front for a few weeks, using its front and hind legs to grab around her waist. After that, it will be \u201cparked\u201d in a tree while the mother goes off to feed. They will feed from her for about 6 to 7 months. Females reach sexual maturity at 10 months, but it can be up to 18 months for males.It has been observed that the maternal instinct in slender lorises is strong, with captive females being observed caring for the infants of other females. In captivity, the slender loris breeds year round. However, individuals in captivity will not breed if no suitable branch is available.\u00a0Location and HabitatRed slender lorises inhabit Sri Lanka and grey slender lorises are found in Sri Lanka and India.The two subspecies of red slender loris differ in their habitat preference. One, the lowland loris, favors wet lowland forests (up to 470 m above sea level) south west of Sri Lanka, while the second, the mountain loris, prefers highland evergreen forests at elevations of 1800\u20132300 m.The gray slender loris can be found in tropical rainforests, coastal acacia scrub forests, semi-evergreen forests, swamps, and bamboo groves up to 2000 m above sea level.They generally prefer thick, thorny vegetation there they can easily escape predators and find the large assortment of insects that is the mainstay of their diet.\u00a0Conservation StatusIt is not clear how many slender lorises survive in the wild or the loris population. Because of their small size and nocturnal habits, it has been difficult to do an accurate count. However, they are considered to be vulnerable by the 2000 IUCN Red List (International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List) and are certainly a threatened species. The red slender loris is an endangered species.In North America, there are only about 10 slender lorises remaining in captivity, and the animals are quite aged. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that a sustainable captive population can be maintained in North America.Native people have always believed that all parts of the animal have some medicinal or magical powers. This has contributed greatly to the decline of the slender loris. Deforestation and habitat destruction is another major factor that is contributing to the decline of these animals.Slender lorises are illegally smuggled to supply a growing exotic pet trade, too. Other threats include habitat loss, electrocution on live wires, and road accidents.\u00a0",
            "slender loris summary of facts": "The Red Slender Loris (Loris tardigradus) is a small, nocturnal prosimian native to the rainforests of Sri Lanka and Southern India.There are two species of Slender Loris, the only members of the genus \u2018Loris\u2019: the Red Slender Loris (Loris tardigradus) and the Grey Slender Loris (Loris lydekkerianus).They have long slender limbs, a well developed index finger, no tail and large prominent ears, which are thin, rounded and hairless at the edges.Its body length on average is 7 \u2013 10 inches (17.5 \u2013 26 centimetres), with an average weight of a mere 3 \u2013 13 ounces (85 \u2013 350 grams).It has a 4 way grip on each foot. The big toe opposes the other 4 toes for a pincer-like grip on branches and food.They spend the day curled up in a tight ball.It approaches prey slowly and carefully, before reaching out and grabbing it with both hands.Slender lorises mostly feed on insects, but they also eat shoots, fruits, leaves, flowers, eggs and small mammals, birds and reptiles.The Slender loris inhabits tropical rainforests, scrub forests, semi-deciduous forests and swamps.They favor lowland rainforests (up to 700 metres in altitude).Although they forage alone, slender lorises sleep in groups of 2 \u2013 4.The Red variant differs from its close relative the Grey variant in its frequent use of rapid arboreal movement.These animals breed twice a year, usually between May and December.The female typically gives birth to one offspring, but sometimes two.Females are dominant.\u00a0"

            "desc": "Sloths are medium-sized mammals that live in the Central and South American rainforests. The sloth got its name from its slow movement, it is not lazy, just slow-moving. The sloth is the slowest mammal on Earth. In total, there are six species of sloth. Sloths belong to the families \u2018Megalonychidae\u2019 and \u2018Bradypodidae\u2019, part of the order \u2018Pilosa\u2019. Most scientists call these two families the \u2018Folivora\u2019 suborder, while some call it \u2018Phyllophaga\u2019.",
            "diet": "Sloths are widely believed to be herbivores, but some accounts refer to them as omnivores. They may eat insects, small lizards and carrion, however, their diet consists mostly of buds, tender shoots and leaves (including leaves from the cecropia tree). For the most part, it is widely accepted that they eat a purely herbivorous diet.It used to be thought that they ate mostly cecropia leaves because they were often spotted in cecropia trees. It turns out that they also live in many other trees, but are not spotted there as easily as in cecropia trees.Sloths have a low metabolic rate and a low body temperature (91\u00b0 Fahrenheit). This keeps their food and water needs to a minimum. They have small molars which they use to chew up their leafy food. Their stomach has many separate compartments that are used to digest the tough cellulose (a component of plant material that they eat).As much as two-thirds of a well fed sloths body weight consists of the contents of its stomach and the digestive process can take as long as a month or more to complete. Even so, leaves provide little energy and they deal with this by a range of economy measures.They have very low metabolic rates (less than half of that expected for a creature of their size) and maintain low body temperatures when active (30 to 34 degrees Celsius or 86 to 93 degrees Fahrenheit) and still lower temperatures when resting.",
            "habitat": "Sloths spend almost all of their lives in trees.",
            "behaviour": "Sloths spend most of their lives hanging upside-down from tree branches. They eat, sleep, mate and give birth upside-down in the trees. Sloths hold onto tree branches with strong, curved claws that are on each of their four feet.Males are solitary, shy animals. Females sometimes congregate together. Sloths are nocturnal, they are most active at night and sleep all day. They sleep about 15 to 18 hours each day, hanging upside down.Sloths move only when necessary and even then very slowly. They have about half as much muscle tissue as other animals of similar weight. They can move at a marginally higher speed if they are in immediate danger from a predator (4.5 metres (15 feet) per minute), but they burn large amounts of energy doing so.Sloths sometimes remain hanging from branches after death. On the ground their maximum speed is 1.5 metres (5 feet) per minute. They mostly move at 15 \u2013 30 centimetres (0.5 \u2013 1 feet) per minute.Sloths are particularly partial to nesting in the crowns of palm trees where they can camouflage as coconuts. They come to the ground to urinate and defecate only about once a week.",
            "reproduction": "Sloths may live 10 \u2013 20 years in the wild. Adult females produce a single baby each year, however, sometimes the lack of movement actually keeps females from finding males for longer than one year. They give birth upside down hanging from a tree branch.Infant sloths normally cling to their mothers fur, but occasionally fall off. They are very sturdily built and rarely die from a fall. In some cases they die from a fall indirectly because the mothers prove unwilling to leave the safety of the trees to retrieve the young.",
            "predators": "The main predators of sloths are the jaguar, the harpy eagle and humans. The majority of sloth deaths in Costa Rica are from contact with electrical lines and from poachers. Their claws also provide a further unexpected deterrent to human hunters \u2013 when hanging upside-down in a tree they are held in place by the claws themselves and often do not fall down even if shot from below.A sloths main forms of protection are its camouflage (greatly increased by the coating of algae growing on its fur) and its very slow movement. These adaptations make the sloth virtually disappear in the rainforest canopy.Sloth Conservation StatusAlthough unable to survive outside the tropical rainforests of South and Central America, within that environment sloths are outstandingly successful creatures. They can account for as much as half the total energy consumption and two-thirds of the total terrestrial mammalian biomass in some areas.Of the six species, only one, the Maned Three-toed Sloth, has a classification of \u2018endangered\u2019 at present.The ongoing destruction of South America\u2019s forests, however, may soon prove a threat to the others.Articles that Mention SlothsAnimals that Start with the Letter SAnimals with 5 Letters in their NamesWhat Do Sloths Eat?How Long Do Sloths Live?"

            "desc": "The slow worm (Anguis fragilis), also known as a deaf adder, a slowworm, a blindworm, or regionally, a long-cripple, is a reptile native to western Eurasia. Its genus is Anguis. Despite its name and appearance, it is not actually a worm or a snake, but a lizard, belonging to the family Anguidae and the order Squamata. They have been shown to be a species complex, consisting of 5 distinct but similar species. The slow worm is a semifossorial (burrowing), legless lizard, which spends much of its time hiding underneath objects. Like many other lizards, they autotomize, meaning that they have the ability to shed their tails to escape predators, the most common of which is the domestic cat. The ability to shed their tail is also where they get their scientific name \u2018fragilis\u2019 (fragile). They can be found in heathland, tussocky grassland, woodland edges and rides where they can find invertebrates to eat and a sunny patch in which to sunbathe.",
            "lifespan": "Slow worms grow to be about 50 cm (20\u2033) long and may be the longest-living lizard. They have been recorded to live for up to 30 years in wild, and the record age for a slow worm in captivity is 54 years!",
            "diet": "Slow worms are carnivorous and feed mainly on invertebrates, including slugs, snails, mealworms and crickets. They prey is small and although they have a similar build to the snake, they cannot expand their body to make room for larger prey.They hunt mostly in long grass and other damp environments to find their prey. They are often referred to as \u201cthe gardener\u2019s friend\u201d, as they prey upon many pest species that attack flowers and vegetables.",
            "behavior": "The slow worm is a diurnal reptile, which means that they are usually active during the day and rest during the night. They mostly hide beneath rocks and logs, which makes them difficult to observe. They need warmth of the sun to gain the energy it needs to hunt, but on warm nights it can gain some energy through conduction from the warm ground.Male slow worms can be seen basking in the spring, but this is usually obscured by vegetation. Females are rarely observed in the open.This species hibernates spend the colder months from October to March underground, only emerging in April to breed. They may disappear underground again during the hottest part of the summer. They are not normally territorial, but fights between males can occur during the breeding season.The slow worm is not usually a fats moving animal, but will move quickly if under threat.",
            "reproduction": "Slow worms have a varied breeding season, depending on the range. In the UK, the breeding season occurs around April or May, and the young are born in August or September. In the Iberian Peninsula, where the climate is warmer, mating may begin as early as March.Males compete with each other to breed with females, often fighting aggressively with each other. Courtship may last for as long as 10 hours before copulation occurs. When mating, the female is bitten in the head or neck region.The slow worm is an ovoviviparous species. Eggs develop and incubate inside the female, and the young are born live. After hatching, the young stay in the mother\u2019s womb for a while. While the babies of slow worms are inside the body of the mother, they live off the yolk of the eggs that hatch inside the bodies of the female slow worms. The gestation period can be between 3 and 5 months long, and the number of offspring can range from 3 to 20! Female slow worms generally reproduce every other year and reach sexual maturity at around 3 to 4 years old.Juveniles are usually very thin and are just about 4 cm long. Both sexes are usually gold in color with dark brown bellies and sides with a dark stripe along the spine when they are young.\u00a0Location and HabitatSlow worms has a broad distribution in continental Europe, where it is found from Scandinavia south to northern Spain and Portugal, and eastwards to southwest Asia and western Siberia. The slow worm is very widespread throughout the UK, but is naturally absent from Ireland.The slow worm can be found in most habitats where there is vegetation, and most commonly resides in grasslands, allotments, gardens, heathlands, and grassy meadows. They prefer locations that are more damp, because this will contain more soft-bodied invertebrates which make up their major food source.The slow worm is very rarely seen out in the open and prefers to be underground or under cover.For hibernation, they need dry, frost free hibernation sites that are safe from predators. This is commonly at the base of a compost heap, or under rubble in urban areas. In wild areas, ant nests are sometimes used, along with grass tussocks, root systems and other deep vegetation structures.Slow Worm Conservation StatusThe slow worm has declined in numbers in recent years, although the species is currently listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. In the UK, the slow worm has been granted protected status, alongside all other native British reptile species. Under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, to intentionally kill, injure, sell, or advertise to sell them is illegal.Habitat loss is the greatest threat to the slow worm, particularly due to development on land that would naturally be a great source of food and shelter for the slow worm.They are also often killed by humans as they are mistaken for snakes. They can be killed by slug pellets in gardens, too.",
            "predators": "Slow worms are small reptiles, which makes them easy prey for many animals. They are most commonly preyed on by birds, snakes and mammals, such as pheasants, badgers, adders and hedgehogs. One of their main predators is the domestic cat.When threatened, they will shed their tail to help them escape from predators. They are also known to defecate which produces a foul smell and wards off the predators, keeping them safe.Slow worms do not post any risk to humans, and should be left alone if found in gardens. In fact, they have a positive impact as they feed on garden pests, particularly slugs.\u00a0Slow Worm FAQsHow do I recognize a slow worm?Slow worms can be difficult to recognize because they look like snakes, but they are actually much smaller than snakes. They measure about about 45cm long and has a cylindrical body which does not taper in at the neck. Color-wise, they vary from grey to bronze with a pale underside. They may also have blue spots, which may indicate a male slow worm.Where does a slow worm live?Slow worms live in many places, including gardens! They live in areas with a lot of vegetation, and prefer to stay covered rather than being out in the open. Their habitats are also often damp, because this where they\u2019ll find food.What does a slow worm eat?Slow worms eat small invertebrates such as slugs, snails, mealworms and crickets. They are excellent at getting rid of pests in our gardens, which is why we should encourage them to live there.\u00a0"

Slugs have soft bodies, which is actually just one big muscle in the stomach area that can be used for almost all of their body functions. Slugs belong to the class Gastropoda, which also contains snails. There are different families of slugs and often these families are not closely related even though they look similar, which can make their taxonomy seem quite confusing. Slugs are invertebrates and do not have any bones in their bodies. They can easily dry out, and for this reason they live in dark and damp habitats. There is no exact population count of slugs, but they are abundant across the world. They can be found on almost every continent.",
            "lifespan": "Depending on the species, a slug can live from anywhere between 1 and 6 years. However, their eggs can remain dormant for years and hatch when the conditions are right.",
            "diet": "Slugs are not picky eaters and most slugs are generalists and feed on a wide variety of organic materials. This can include leaves, flowers, fruit, dead plants, lichens, mushrooms and carrion. They often reside in vegetable gardens, and eat vegetables and herbs, as well as petunias, chrysanthemums, daisies, lobelia, lilies and daffodils.Some slugs are predators and eat other slugs and snails, or earthworms. Some slugs are fungivores, fending on slime molds and mushrooms.",
            "behavior": "Slugs are mostly solitary animals, although on hot days will huddle together in the shade, flank to flank, to remain cool. They are mostly active just after rain because of the moist ground, and many species are nocturnal. They tend to spent their non active periods hiding in damp places such as under tree bark, fallen logs, rocks and man-made structures to help retain body moisture.To move, slugs use their whole body. They contract a series of muscles on the underside of the body, which gives them the \u201cwave\u201d motion as they move.Slugs are known to be aggressive with each other, particularly if they are competing for resources. This is usually more likely to happen in the summer, when there are less resources available for them.",
            "mucus": "Slugs produce two types of mucus: one is thin and watery, and the other thick and sticky. The thin mucus spreads from the foot\u2019s centre to its edges, whereas the thick mucus spreads from front to back. The mucus secreted by the foot contains fibres that help prevent the slug from slipping down vertical surfaces.The \u201cslime trail\u201d a slug leaves behind allows other slugs coming across the trail to recognize the slime trail as produced by one of the same species, which helps them to find a mate. The same slime trail can also be used by carnivorous slugs when hunting.Slugs also produce thick mucus that coats their whole body, which keeps them moist but also can provide some protection against predators by making them difficult to pick up. This mucus can also be unpleasant to their prey to eat. Some slugs can also produce very sticky mucus which can incapacitate predators and can trap them within the secretion.Some species of slug secrete slime cords to suspend a pair during copulation, too.",
            "reproduction": "Slugs are hermaphrodites which means they have male and female reproductive organs. For this reason, they don\u2019t actually need to find a mate to reproduce, although most do.Once a slug has located a mate, they encircle each other and sperm is exchanged through their protruded genitalia. A few days later, the slugs lay approximately thirty eggs in a hole in the ground, or under the cover of an object.Slug eggs don\u2019t have to hatch right away. They can remain dormant for years and hatch when the conditions are right.",
            "location and habitat": "Slugs can be found all over the world. They prefer dark and damp habitats, because they have damp habitats and can dry out in warm habitats. It is for this reason that they are mostly seen in the spring and the fall.Slugs can reside in areas created by humans like sheds and gardens, but can also live in areas such as woods and forests where there is less human activity. They like to live under rocks, stones, and rotten logs, and some even live underground.",
            "s and humans": "Slugs are commonly found in gardens and can wreak havoc. They can destroy the foliage of plants faster than the plant can grow, wiping out even very large plants in a short amount of time. They also eat fruit and vegetables, which can make crops more vulnerable to disease or difficult to sell for aesthetic reasons. Unfortunately, slugs can also carry dangerous parasites, which can cause harm to humans if touched.Humans use a verity of methods to prevent slugs from causing damage to plants. These can include iron phosphate bates, crushed egg shells, coffee grounds and beer traps. Salt can also be used to kill slugs by causing water to leave their body.",
            "importance": "While to many people, especially gardeners, slugs can be a real nuisance because they eat vegetables and plants, they are actually very important to the ecosystem. This is because they also eat decaying plant material and fungi. Carnivorous slugs also eat dead specimens of their own kind.Slug Conservation StatusThe exact population of the slug is not known, but it is very unlikely that slugs are a threatened animal. They are widespread across their range, with, on average, 200 slugs living in 1 cubic m (35 cubic ft) of soil.",
            "predators": "Slugs are preyed on by vertebrates and invertebrates. The vertebrates include reptiles, such as snakes and lizards, birds, such as blackbirds, starlings, rooks and owls, fish, amphibians, and mammals such as foxes, badgers and hedgehogs. Invertebrates such as beetles are also known to prey on slugs.To help prevent slugs from being preyed on, they contract their body and make themselves hardened, compact, and round when attacked. This allows them to attach themselves to the substrate beneath them.Furthermore, the mucus they produce makes it difficult for predators to grasp them, and this mucus can even incapacitate their predators. Some slugs can self-amputate their tail to escape from predators\u00a0Slug FAQsAre slugs poisonous?Slugs are not poisonous to humans. In fact, some species of slug are even edible. However, they don\u2019t taste great! The average slug you might fin din your garden will not hurt you, although they can host a dangerous parasite called rat lungworm. Slugs contract the parasite by eating infected rodents\u2019 feces.What is the difference between a snail and a slug?The biggest difference between slugs and snails is the lack of shell in the slug. Slugs evolved from snails and lost their shell over time. The shell of snails is made of calcium and other minerals, and offers the snail a place to retract when the weather turns hot and dry to avoid desiccation. The slug, on the other hand, must retreat underground.Does salt kill slugs?Yes. Salt draws the water out of their skin by osmosis, and they can die within minutes of dehydration.What do slugs eat in my garden?Slugs eat a lot in the garden! They eat plant leaves, stems and roots, as well as flowers, vegetables and fruits. Fortunately, they can also eat plant debris and fungi, so they\u2019re not all bad!\u00a0Slug TaxonomyThere are various taxonomic families of land slugs that form part of different evolutionary lineages, which often includes snails, and therefore various families of slugs are not closely related. Their taxonomy can seem quite confusing.Slugs belong to the class Gastropoda, which is made up of snails and slugs. Slugs belong to the subclass Heterobranchia and the informal group Pulmonata. Within Pulmonata, there are six orders, two of which, Onchidiacea and Soleolifera, solely comprise slugs.A third informal group, the Sigmurethra, belongs to the order Stylommatophora, and contains various clades of snails, semi-slugs (snails whose shells are too small for them to retract fully into) and slugs.The break down of slug taxonomy in the order Stylommatophora can be seen below.Subinfraorder OrthurethraSuperfamily AchatinelloideaSuperfamily CochlicopoideaSuperfamily PartuloideaSuperfamily PupilloideaSubinfraorder SigmurethraSuperfamily AcavoideaSuperfamily AchatinoideaSuperfamily AillyoideaSuperfamily ArionoideaSuperfamily AthoracophoroideaFamily AthoracophoridaeSuperfamily OrthalicoideaSubfamily BulimulinaeSuperfamily CamaenoideaSuperfamily ClausilioideaSuperfamily DyakioideaSuperfamily GastrodontoideaSuperfamily HelicoideaSuperfamily HelixarionoideaSuperfamily LimacoideaSuperfamily OleacinoideaSuperfamily OrthalicoideaSuperfamily PlectopylidoideaSuperfamily PolygyroideaSuperfamily PunctoideaSuperfamily RhytidoideaFamily RhytididaeSuperfamily SagdidoideraSuperfamily StaffordioideaSuperfamily StreptaxoideaSuperfamily StrophocheiloideaSuperfamily ParmacelloideaSuperfamily ZonitoideaSuperfamily QuijotoideaFamily Quijotidae\u00a0Slug SpeciesThere are over 40,000 species of Gastropods. It would be impossible to list all species of slug here, but below are some of the most common slug species and their taxonomy. Some of these slugs have common names, while others are known by their scientific names.Leopard slugOrder: StylommatophoraFamily: LimacidaeGenus: LimaxSpecies: Limax maximusThe leopard slug, also known as the great gray slug, is native to Europe, but has been accidentally introduced to many other parts of the world. It is now found across Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, North America, South America and Oceania.This slug is among the largest keeled slugs, measuring 10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 in) in length and is generally a light grayish or gray-brown with darker spots and blotches.The leopard slug is widely distributed and is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.Black slugOrder: StylommatophoraFamily: ArionidaeGenus: ArionSpecies: Arion aterThe black slug, also known as black arion, European black slug, or large black slug is a terrestrial slug that is native to Europe but an invasive species in Australia, Canada (British Columbia, Newfoundland, Quebec), and the United States (Pacific Northwest).Without a shell, this slug produces mucus to deter predators. It usually measures from 10 to 15 cm (3.9 to 5.9 in) in length and is generally deep black, with some adults being brown or even white. Like other terrestrial slugs, the black slug is a hermaphrodite, meaning it can find a mate or self-fertilize.Black slugs are edible but are rarely consumed by humans because they taste horrible.Yellow slugSuperfamily: LimacoideaFamily: LimacidaeGenus: LimacusSpecies: Limacus flavusThe yellow slug, also known as the cellar slug or the tawny garden slug, is an air-breathing land slug found in Scotland, England, Wales and Ireland as well as most of southern and western Europe. It has a yellow body with grey mottling, and pale blue tentacles. When extended, its body length can be 7.5 to 10 cm (3.0 to 3.9 in) long.Red slugOrder: StylommatophoraFamily: ArionidaeGenus: ArionSpecies: Arion rufusThe red slug, also known as the large red slug, chocolate arion and European red slug is a roundback slug found in western Europe, including France, the Low Countries, Germany, western Poland, Switzerland and the southern parts of the British Isles.As its common name suggests, its body color is often reddish, sometimes very vivid, but can also be orange, yellowish, brown and grayish. Some individuals may be black. It is one of the largest species in its genus, measuring up to 150 mm when extended.Kerry slugOrder: StylommatophoraFamily: ArionidaeGenus: GeomalacusSpecies: Geomalacus maculosusThe Kerry slug, also known as the Kerry spotted slug, is an air-breathing land slug found in Ireland, north-western Spain, and central-to-northern Portugal. It usually measures 7 to 8 cm (2.8 to 3.1 in) in length and is dark-grey or brown with yellowish spots.The name Kerry in the common name for this slug is derived from County Kerry in the south-west of Ireland where the slugs that were used for the formal scientific description were collected. As a round-backed slug, it has no keel on its back, unlike the slugs in the families Limacidae and Milacidae.The Kerry slug is protected by conservation laws in the three countries in which it occurs. It is currently listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.Field slugOrder: StylommatophoraFamily: AgriolimacidaeGenus: DerocerasSpecies: Deroceras agresteThe field slug, also known as gray field slug, milky slug, and northern field slug, is an air-breathing land slug found in Asia and northern and central Europe. It measures up to 5 centimeters long and is pale brown and tan in color. It lives in moist grassy and marshy habitat types and feeds on dead and living plant material.Worm slugSuperfamily: LimacoideaFamily: BoettgerillidaeGenus: BoettgerillaSpecies: Boettgerilla pallensThe worm slug is an air-breathing land slug found in much of Europe, parts of North America and parts of South America. It is a very narrow and slender slug, almost worm-like and sharply keeled.

            "desc": "Snakes are a very large group of long reptiles. There are over 2,500 different species of snakes on our planet. Snakes live in a variety of land and water habitats. The most abundant snakes and the largest snakes are found in tropical climates such as rainforests. Snakes are found on every continent in the world except Antarctica where it is too cold for them to survive. There are also no snakes native to Hawaii, Iceland, Ireland or New Zealand.",
            "snake characteristics": "Snakes have a long, narrow body with scales covering their skin. Snakes have no eyelids, no external ear openings and no legs, although a few snakes, such as boa constrictors and pythons have vestigial (concealed or hidden) hind legs which are tiny, clawed digits known as \u2018anal spurs\u2019 which are used to grasp during mating. As they grow, snakes shed their old skin and the film that covers their eyes regularly. Like other reptiles, snakes are cold-blooded.Snakes have been around for millions of years. Snakes existed during the dinosaur periods. Snakes were very modern reptiles compared to the dinosaurs. Snakes first appeared during the late Cretaceous period (about 146 million years ago), towards the end of the time of the dinosaurs. So the late dinosaurs, like Tyrannosaurus Rex and Triceratops were around when the first snakes evolved. A snakes diet would have been warm-blooded mammals and they could see whether potential prey was warm or cold blooded. As most or all dinosaurs were cold-blooded, it was very rare for a snake to make a meal out of them.Less than one-third of all snakes are venomous and fewer than 300 may be fatal to humans.Brahminy blind snakes are the smallest snakes in the world measuring two inches in length. The anaconda is probably the largest snake and can reach lengths of 38 feet.Snakes are found in many habitats including in the water, forests, deserts and prairies.Like most reptiles, snakes are ectotherms which means they must regulate their own body temperature. Snakes bask in the sun to warm themselves up and move to cooler locations to cool themselves down. Snakes hibernate during the winter months.",
            "snake senses": "While snake vision is unremarkable (generally being best in arboreal species and worst in burrowing species), it is able to detect movement. Some snakes, like the Asian vine snake, have binocular vision (in which both eyes are used together). In most snakes, the lens moves back and forth within the eyeball to focus. In addition to their eyes, some snakes (pit vipers, pythons and some boas) have infrared-sensitive receptors in deep grooves between the nostril and eye which allow them to actually see radiated heat.Snakes have no external ears, however, they do have a bone called the \u2018quadrate\u2019 under the skin on either side of the head which focuses sound into the cochlea. Their sense of hearing is most sensitive to frequencies around 200 \u2013 300 Hz.A snake smells by using its forked tongue to collect airborne particles then passing them to the Jacobson\u2019s organ (a sensory organ) in the mouth for examination. The fork in the tongue gives the snake a sort of directional sense of smell. The part of the body which is in direct contact with the surface of the ground is very sensitive to vibration, therefore a snake is able to sense other animals approaching.",
            "snake diet": "All snakes are carnivorous (meat-eaters). Snakes eat rodents and other mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, amphibians, insects and eggs. Some snakes (like cobras, vipers and rattlesnakes) are venomous and kill or paralyze their prey by injecting poison through hollow fangs. The venom from venomous snakes paralyzes the nervous system, causes heart and lung failure, or causes internal bleeding of their prey.Some snakes like boas and the anacondas, kill their prey by squeezing it to death, the squeezing does not always crush their victims but rather prevents it from breathing and suffocates it. Snakes do not chew their food or even bite it into pieces they just swallow their food whole.After eating, snakes become inactive while they digest their food. Digestion is an intensive activity, especially after the consumption of very large prey. In species that feed only at irregular intervals, their entire intestine enters a reduced state between meals to conserve energy and the digestive system is \u2018up-regulated\u2019 to full capacity within 48 hours of prey consumption. So much metabolic energy is involved in digestion that in such species as the Mexican rattlesnake, an increase of body temperature rises to as much as 14 degrees Celsius above the surrounding environment. Because of this, a snake disturbed after recently eating will often regurgitate its prey in order to be able to escape the perceived threat. However, when undisturbed, the digestive process is highly efficient, dissolving and absorbing everything but hair and claws, which are excreted along with uric acid waste. Snakes have been known to occasionally die from trying to swallow an animal that is too big. Snake digestive fluids are unable to digest most plant matter, which passes through the digestive system mostly untouched.A big meal will keep some snakes hunger at bay for a long time. Anacondas and pythons can live for up to a year after eating large prey without having to find food. Snakes hunt mostly at night.",
            "snake reproduction": "Reproduction in snakes varies between species \u2013 some lay eggs, just like the dinosaurs did, some give birth to live young, just like mammals. The eggs and hatched young are not cared for by either parents, with the exception of some species of Python. Baby rattlesnakes are one species for example, that are born with little parental concern, ready with all their faculties to get on with life.Some species are ovoviviparous and retain the eggs within their bodies until they are almost ready to hatch. Recently, it has been confirmed that several species of snake are fully viviparous, such as the green anaconda, nourishing their young through a placenta as well as a yolk sac, highly unusual among reptiles. Retention of eggs and live birth are commonly, but not exclusively, associated with cold environments, as the retention of the young within the female allows her to control their temperature more effectively than if the developing young were in external eggs.Snakes are believed to live for more than 20 years in the wild, however, in captivity, some species will live as long as 50 years.",
            "snake conservation status": "Snakes are classed as an endangered species and are under the protection of the Endangered Species Act. Their main threats are being killed on roads and habitat destruction."

It breeds on The Snares, a group of islands off the southern coast of the South Island in New Zealand. Snares Island is a marine sanctuary which permits no humans. Currently there are about 30,000 breeding pairs of Snares penguins on the islands. This habitat offers a moderate climate with enough vegetation for nest building and roosting. Snares penguins are closely related to the Fiordland penguins. ",
            "characteristics": "Snares Penguins are a medium-sized, yellow-crested penguin that grow to approximately 60 centimetres in height. Snares Penguins have dark blue-black upper parts and white under parts.Snares Penguins have a bright yellow eyebrow-stripe which extends over the eye to form a drooping, bushy crest. They have bare pink skin at the base of its large red-brown beak.",
            "diet": "Snares Penguins eat a variety fish, squid and krill which populate the warm waters of Southern New Zealand. As most penguin species do, they feed by shallow pursuit diving, using their webbed feet and strong flippers to propel them through the water at speeds up to 15 miles per hour.",
            "behaviour": "Breeding season for the Snares penguin begins in early summer and there is often much fighting and jockeying for territory and resources within the colonies.Preferring forest or shaded vegetation, mated pairs scrape out shallow holes in the ground which they line with grasses, leaves, twigs and branches.",
            "reproduction": "Two eggs are laid but only one chick survives. The egg is kept warm by both parents for 31 to 73 days. Once the eggs hatch the male broods and cares for the chick for 3 weeks. When the chicks are 3 to 4 weeks old they form a cr\u00e8che with other chicks. Both parents feed the chick daily until it molts at about 75 days. At this time it will go to sea to provide for itself.",
            "predators": "While they have no natural land predators, Snares penguins do have to contend with the usual sea-going mammals like Hooker\u2019s sea lions.",

It breeds north of the timberline in Greenland, Canada, Alaska, and the northeastern tip of Siberia, and spend winters in warm parts of North America from southwestern British Columbia through parts of the United States to Mexico. This bird belongs to the genus Anser and the family Anatidae. Both white and dark varieties of this goose exist, with the latter often known as blue goose. The name snow goose derives from the typically white plumage. The snow goose feeds on roots, leaves and grasses, using their bills for digging up roots in thick mud. Their most common predators are artic foxes and gull-like birds called jaegers. They usually nest in colonies and travel in large flocks made of many family units.",
            "lifespan": "The exact lifespan of the snow goose is unknown but it is believed they have quite long lifespans. They may live for up to 26 years.",
            "diet": "The snow goose is mainly a herbivore and eats eat roots, leaves, grasses, and sedges. Their main sources of food include saltgrass, wild millet, spikeruch, feathergrass, panic grass, seashore paspalum, delta duckpatato, bulrush, cordgrass, cattail, ryegrass, wild rice, berries, aquatic plants and invertebrates, and agricultural crops.In northern breeding grounds, their most common food source is American bulrush, but in the south during winter, they feed on the aquatic vegetation in wetlands and estuaries. They also hunt for food in agricultural fields, eating oats, corn and winter wheat.To forage, they use their strong bills to dig up roots in thick mud. They also graze and shear plants off at ground level, or rip entire stems from the ground.",
            "behavior": "Snow geese are social animals that travel in large flocks made of many family units and fly during both night and day during migration. Snow geese frequently travel and feed alongside greater white-fronted geese.They are strong fliers, walkers, and swimmers, and spend most of their time feeding and resting. They forage on foot and sleep while sitting, standing on one leg, or swimming.The males are territorial toward other males, and the females toward other females. These animals are very vocal and can often be heard from more than a mile away. They are particularly known for their loud squawking and honking.",
            "reproduction": "Snow geese breed from May to mid-August. They are monogamous, with long-term pairs forming in the second year, although breeding does not usually start until the third year. Snow geese most often nest in colonies and females are strongly philopatric, meaning they will return to the place they hatched to breed.A female will select a nest site and build a nest on an area of high ground. The nest is lined with plant material and may be used year after year. The female will lay one egg a day until she reaches a full clutch of about 3 to 5. The eggs are incubated for 23 to 25 days while the male guards the nest and the mother. The hatched young are called goslings.Goslings in the white phase have a body that is a dirty white in color with black wing tips, and in the immature blue phase they are a slate gray with little or no white. In both immature snow geese color phases they have red feet and legs but they are not as bright as the adult goose. Goslings may eat fruits, flowers, horsetail shoots, and fly larvae.The young grow rapidly and are fully fledged within forty-five days, with females reaching sexual maturity between 2 and 4 years old. They remain with their family until this time.\u00a0Snow Goose Location and HabitatThe snow goose breeds north of the timberline in Greenland, Canada, Alaska, and the northeastern tip of Siberia. They reside in the vicinity of the coast, from the high arctic to the subarctic and prefer areas within 10 km of ponds, shallow lakes, coastal salt marshes, or streams.Following the hatching of goslings, families move to brood-rearing territories with a lot of grasses and bryophytes, including tidal marshes and wet areas near ponds. In the winter, they prefer open habitats like marshes, grasslands, marine inlets, freshwater ponds, and agricultural fields.",
            "migration": "Snow geese are a migratory species and spend more than half the year on their migration to-and-from warmer wintering areas. They can travel more than 3,000 mi (4,800 km). They leave their breeding grounds in September, and begin to arrive at the St. Lawrence River area in October and stay until early November when they continue to their American wintering grounds. Their main wintering grounds are along the gulf coast of Louisiana and Texas between the Mississippi delta and Corpus Christi, Texas. They leave their wintering grounds in March and head north over the New England states and over central Quebec, Canada.Snow Goose Conservation StatusThe snow goose is currently listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. The population of greater snow geese was in decline at the beginning of the 20th century, but has now recovered to sustainable levels. In fact, these animals are considered to be overabundant in some areas. The breeding population of the lesser snow goose currently exceeds 5 million birds. Non-breeding geese (juveniles or adults that fail to nest successfully) are not included in this estimate, however, so the total number of geese is likely higher.Snow geese in North America have increased to the point where the breeding areas and wintering grounds are both becoming severely degraded, which is affecting other species using the same habitat.There have been periodic hunting seasons established to help curb the growing population. There are restrictions, however. About 400,000 Snow Geese are now hunted annually in the US and Canada.",
            "predators": "The main predators of the snow goose are artic foxes, wolves, bears, bald eagles, or golden eagles. The biggest threat occurs is during the breeding season, in the first couple of weeks after the eggs are laid and then after hatching. During this time, the eggs and nestlings are at risk from arctic and red foxes, glaucous gulls, herring gulls, parasitic jaegers, caribou, polar bears and black bears, gray wolves, common ravens, long-tailed jaegers, and snowy owls.\u00a0Snow Goose FAQsWhere does the snow goose live?The snow goose lives in North America. Their breeding grounds are around Greenland, Canada and Alaska, but in the winter they travel south to warmer areas, such as Louisiana and Texas. They like to live close to water sources, like ponds, shallow lakes, coastal salt marshes, and streams.What does the snow goose eat?The snow goose is mainly herbivorous and eats roots, leaves, grasses. However, these birds will also eat aquatic invertebrates.Is the snow goose white?Some snow geese are white. However, a dark variety of this goose exists, and is often known as the blue goose. The two color morphs of the snow goose were once thought to be separate species, but they are now considered two color phases of the same species because they are found together throughout their ranges and interbreed.How rare is the snow goose?This goose is actually not that rare \u2014 in some areas, they are considered to be overabundant. While their population declined at the beginning of the 20th century, it has now recovered and the breeding population currently exceeds 5 million birds. However, unless you live in an area that the goose resides, they are a very rare sight!\u00a0"

            "desc": "The Snow Leopard is sometimes known as the \u2018Ounce\u2019. It is a large cat native to the mountain ranges of Central Asia and well known for its beautiful fur. The snow leopards range in central and south Asia is rugged mountainous regions of approximately 1,230,000 square kilometres, which extends through 12 countries: Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The total wild population of the snow leopard is estimated at between 4,000 and 7,500 individuals. There are also 600 \u2013 700 snow leopards in zoos around the world. Although sharing its name with the common leopard, the snow leopard is not believed to be closely related to the Leopard or the other members of the Pantherine group and is classified as the sole member of the genus \u2018Uncia uncia\u2019.",
            "description": "The Snow Leopard has a white fur coat with brownish/yellow tinges that is covered with rings of brown/black rosettes/spots. The markings help camouflage it from prey. Their fur is long and woolly and helps protect the cat from extreme cold. Snow Leopards have heavy fur on their tail and the bottom of their paws are covered with fur for protection against the cold snow.The snow leopards head, which has small ears and a distinctive heavy brow, is rounded and comparatively small for their body size, which can be up to 1.3 metres in length and weigh up to around 70 kilograms. Their long tail, which can measure as much as 90 centimetres, helps the cats balance as they move over rugged and often snowy terrain. The powerful limbs of the snow leopard are relatively short for their body size and are supported by large, powerful paws.Due to the under-development of the fibro-elastic tissue that forms part of the vocal apparatus, the snow leopard cannot give a full, deep roar and this along with differences in skull characteristics help to separate them from their fellow \u2018big cats\u2019.",
            "habitat": "During the summer, the snow leopard inhabits mountainous meadows above the tree line in rocky alpine regions at an altitude of 2,700 metres (8,900 feet) to 6,000 metres (20,000 feet). In winter, snow leopards descend to forests at lower altitudes.The snow leopard is generally associated with generally rocky terrain such as high valley ridges, rocky outcrops and mountain passes. The snow leopard is rarely associated with dense forestation. An individual snow leopard inhabits a well defined home range, however, it does not defend its range aggressively when trespassed by other individuals. A snow leopards home range can vary greatly in size. It can be as small as 5 square miles or as large as 15 square miles.",
            "diet": "Snow Leopards are opportunists when it comes to feeding. They are strictly carnivores and eat whatever meat they can find. One of the most beautiful of the cats, snow leopards are also exceptional athletes capable of making huge leaps over ravines. They can also bring down prey almost three times their own size including domestic livestock. Their prey includes the ibex, markhor, bharal, deer, boar, marmots, pikas and small rodents.The snow leopard is an ambush predator and will attack its prey from above when possible. It is an agile animal that can jump as far as 14 metres which helps it catch prey and traverse through the mountains. It is common that the snow leopard will remain close to its kill and return over a period of 3 to 4 days to feed.",
            "behaviour": "Snow Leopards are crepuscular (active at dawn and dusk) in their hunting activities. Commonly, the cat is a solitary hunter, however, it may share the task with its mate during breeding season.",
            "reproduction": "The gestation period for the female snow leopard is around 98 days. Due to harsh weather conditions in the alpine regions, cubs are usually born in springtime with mating taking place in late winter. This ensures that a food source is abundant and less effort is needed to secure a kill. Females give birth in rocky dens lined with their fur. The litter size is usually between 1 \u2013 4 cubs. The cubs weigh between 320 \u2013 708 grams at birth and have a daily average weight gain of approximately 48 grams per day. The cubs follow their mother on hunts at 3 months old and remain with her through their first winter.The life span of a snow leopard is normally 15 \u2013 18 years, however, in captivity it can live up to 20 \u2013 21 years.",
            "conservation status": "In 1972, the IUCN placed the snow leopard on its Red List of Threatened Species as \u2018Endangered\u2019. Due to the high demand for their coats, snow leopards are illegally hunted for the fur trade. The pelts are a sought-after commodity in places like Central Asia, Eastern Europe and Russia where they are turned into coats and other garments. Snow leopard bones and body parts are also used for traditional Asian medicine.There are numerous agencies working to conserve the snow leopard and its threatened mountain ecosystems. These include the Snow Leopard Trust, the Snow Leopard Conservancy and the Snow Leopard Network. Their focus on research, community programs in snow leopard regions and education programs are aimed at understanding the cats needs as well as the needs of the villagers and herder communities impacting the snow leopards life and habitat."

It is larger than other hares and weighs around 3 to 4 pounds as an adult. The snowshoe hare is appropriately named because it has very large back feet. It looks as if it is wearing large shoes made for walking in the snow. These large feet prevent the hare from sinking into the deep snow as it hops and walks, as the toes can spread out to act like snowshoes. Their feet also have fur on the bottom, which protects them from the cold and gives them traction in the snow.During the winter, the snowshoe hares fur turns white in color to help it camouflage from predators. During summer, its fur turns a rusty/brown color. Throughout the year, however, its flanks remain white and there are distinguishable black tufts of fur on the edge of its ears.",

Their overall appearance is somewhat like a rodent, however, it is a member of the order Soricomorpha and should not be confused as a member of the order Rodentia. \u00a0 The Southern Short-tailed Shrew is very similar in appearance to the Northern Short-tailed Shrew except that it is smaller measuring about 3 \u2013 5 inches in length and weighing about 8 grams. The Shrew\u2019s tail is always less than half the length of the head and body. Their color is greyish-black, sometimes with a silvery or brownish cast. The Southern Short-tailed Shrew has a protruding snout and short external ears which are almost concealed by its soft, dense fur.",
            "habitat": "The Southern Short-tailed Shrews preferred habitat includes deciduous or coniferous forests, fields, grassy areas near water, salt marshes and wet open areas. Adequate cover and food appear to be more important in determining their presence than the type of soil or vegetation.Southern Short-tailed Shrews burrows occupy two different zone levels. One level being several centimetres beneath the ground or sometimes upon the ground, the other level somewhat deeper at around 40 \u2013 60 centimetres below the surface. The two levels are joined at irregular intervals. Most burrows are made beneath logs and sometimes joins the log which is then honeycombed. Rotten wooded logs are preferred as these are easier to work with.",
            "behaviour and diet": "Southern Short-tailed Shrews tend to be more sociable than the Northern Shrews. Burrows can contain several individuals who work together and seldom fight. Certain males and females remain close together during pre breeding season.This Shrew is active day and night and throughout the year. Their home range is 0.5 \u2013 1.0 acre. Populations are as high as 25 per acre, usually fewer. The Southern Short-tailed Shrew builds its own tunnels in the ground or snow and also uses those of other animals. Runways are used for food storage. Their nest is built of dry leaves, grass and hair, at a diameter from 6 \u2013 8 inches beneath logs, stumps, rocks, or debris.The Southern Short-tailed Shrews diet consists of insects, annelids, vegetable matter, centipedes, arachnids, mollusks, vertebrates and crustaceans. It has been known to store snails for the winter. The saliva is venomous and is injected into the wounds of its prey by the teeth. The Southern Short-tailed Shrews venom is strong enough to kill mice, but is not lethal to humans.",
            "reproduction": "The breeding season of this Shrew lasts from February to November and females have 2 or 3 litters per year. The gestation period lasts from 21 to 30 days. Each litter consists of two to six young. The young are reared in nests of grasses and leaves by which entry is gained through a tunnel. The nests for the young are much larger than their resting nests.",
            "venom": "An interesting feature of the Southern Short-tailed Shrew is the venom produced by the sub maxillary glands, which is present in the saliva and may be introduced into wounds made by the teeth. Injections of 6 milligrams of an extract prepared from the sub maxillary gland are strong enough to kill mice but there is little likelihood of the venom having any serious effect on man.",
            "predators": "Reproduction of the Southern Short-tailed Shrew is potentially high which makes their predator list rather high too. Known predators include the milk snake, black snake, red-tailed hawk, red-shouldered hawk, sparrow hawk, broad winged hawk, barn owl, short-eared owl, barred owl, horned owl, long-eared owl, screech owl, fox, weasel and skunk.

It is the only living bear species native to South America. The Spectacled Bear is the closest living kin of the short-faced bears of the Middle Pleistocene to Late Pleistocene age. The Spectacled Bear is one of the most endangered bear species in the world, the most endangered being the Giant Panda Bear which is their closest living relative today. Females are called \u2018Cows\u2019, males are called \u2018Boars\u2019 and the young are called \u2018Cubs\u2019. ",
            "description": "Spectacled Bears are generally smaller bears of the Ursidae family. Males are significantly larger than females (33% larger) and grow over 5 feet (1.5 metres) in length and weigh up to 340 pounds (154 kilograms). Females rarely weigh more than 180 pounds (82 kilograms).Spectacled Bears are so named because of the large white circles or semicircles of white fur around their eyes giving them the appearance of wearing spectacles. The shaggy fur of the Spectacled Bear is black with beige sometimes red colored markings on its face and upper chest. Because of the warm climate where they live, their fur is reasonable thinner than most other bear species and they do not have to hibernate. All other types of bear have 14 pairs of ribs, however, the Spectacled Bear only has 13.They have long, curved, sharp claws that are used for climbing and for digging into insect mounds such as ant hills and termite hills for food. Their front limbs are longer than their back limbs which helps them to climb trees more easily. Spectacled Bears have very strong jaws and wide, flat molars to help them chew through tough vegetation such as tree bark.",
            "habitat": "The Spectacled Bears preferred habitats are tropical mountain forests and alpine grasslands. They live mainly in the lush high altitude forests clothing the slopes of the Andes Mountains climbing as high as 14,000 feet (4,300 metres). The bears are much more numerous on the eastern side of the Andes, where they are less vulnerable to human colonization. The bears come down from the mountains only in search for food and have been observed on coastal deserts and steppe lands.",
            "diet": "These bears are primarily herbivores but are generally classed as omnivores. They mainly travel through forests collecting ripe fruit, berries, cacti and honey. During periods when ripe fruit is not available, they will also feed upon bamboo hearts, corn and epiphytes \u2013 plants that grow on other plants called bromeliads. Occasionally, they will supplement their diet with insects, rodents and birds. On average, only around 7% of the bears diet is carnivorous.",
            "behaviour": "Spectacled Bears are nocturnal and are mainly active at night especially during the twilight hours. During the day, they shelter in caves, under tree roots or on tree trunks. They are arboreal creatures and expert climbers and spend a great deal of time foraging in trees. Their survival is highly dependant on the ability to climb even the tallest trees of the Andes forests.Once the bears are up in the trees, they often build feeding platforms from broken branches. The bears use these platforms to reach for more food.Spectacled Bears are not territorial, however, they do tend to isolate themselves from others in order to avoid competition. If they do encounter other bear or even a human, these shy bears react in a docile but cautious manner. However, they will attack if they feel threatened or a mothers cubs are in danger, like other bears, mother bears are very protective of their young.Spectacled Bears are also solitary animals and are normally only seen together during the mating season. Because they are solitary animals, these bears are usually very silent creatures. It is only when they do encounter another bear that they can be very vocal.",
            "reproduction": "Being a tropical species of bear, breeding takes place all year round but mainly April to June. Spectacled Bears reach maturity and begin to breed between the age of 4 and 7 years.Female Spectacle Bears give birth to 1 \u2013 2 cubs every 2 \u2013 3 years. Gestation period is 6 \u2013 7 months. Breeding pairs stay together for a few weeks after mating occurs. The female is capable of planning her pregnancy and birth by making sure the birth occurs about 90 days prior to the peak of the fruit season so food supplies are ample. If a season occurs where food supplies are scarce, the female bear can delay implantation whereby the embryos can simply be absorbed into the mothers body and she will not give birth that year.The female bear will construct a \u2018den\u2019 prior to giving birth. Cubs weigh 10 \u2013 18 ounces at birth and are helpless and their eyes remain closed for the first month. The cubs will stay with their mother for at least 2 years, riding on her back when they are small, before being chased away by adult males seeking to mate with the female.The life span of the Spectacled Bear can be 25 years in the wild and 36 years in captivity.",
            "conservation status": "Spectacled Bears are listed as vulnerable on the World Conservation Union\u2019s Red List of Threatened Species. The population of Spectacled Bears is under threat for a number of reasons. They are hunted by locals who believe they will eat their livestock, even though these bears do not eat large amounts of meat. Extensive farming and logging have led to habitat loss. The Spectacled Bears gall bladder is valued in Oriental medicines, so they are hunted for this reason also. Some estimates suggest that there are only around 3,000 Spectacled Bears surviving in the wild today."

The largest of the tropical owl species, this owl gets its name from \u201cspectacles\u201d of white feathers around their eyes and throat. Its other feathers are mostly brown, with a creamy coloured breast. Spectacled owls feed on mice and insects, and will also take larger mammals. They are a largely nocturnal animal and generally unsociable with others of its kind. Because the spectacled owl occurs over such a large range and is abundant over this range, its population is not considered to be threatened or endangered.\u00a0 The spectacled owl is the largest of all tropical owl species, with females being larger than males.

Its distribution range includes: Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guyana, French Guiana, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, Suriname, Trinidad & Tobago, United States and Venezuela. The Spectacled Caiman is an extremely adaptable species found in virtually all lowland wetland and riverine habitats throughout its range, although it generally prefers areas of still water. The Spectacled Caiman can tolerate salt water as well as fresh, therefore, it is the most common of all crocodilian species. The extensive Panatal floodplain provides a perfect habitat for the caiman during the rainy season.",
            "caiman reproduction": "Female Spectacled Caimans become sexually mature at between 4 and 7 years depending on the population. Male Spectacled Caimans mature at larger sizes than females, but at similar ages (1.4 months and 4 to 7 years). Social status affects growth rate and breeding. Less dominant animals grow less quickly due to stress and often do not get the chance to breed.Gonads (an organ in animals that produces reproductive cells) begin to increase in size towards the end of the dry season (April to May) and peak at the start of the wet season (May to June). Courtship and mating generally occur between May and August and the eggs (from 14 to 40, average size being around 22) are laid during the wet season (July to August) in a mound nest constructed from soil and vegetation. The location of the nest is generally under cover, but some are sited in more open areas or on floating mats of vegetation.Nests may be shared by females, an activity which may help to increase the survival of juveniles from each parent.Nest predators include large Tupinambis lizards (a large, carnivorous South American lizard), which can destroy up to 80% of nests in an area. Female Spectacled Caimans will remain close to nests in an attempt to deter predators.When the juveniles hatch after around 90 days, there is usually a plentiful supply of invertebrate food available due to the timing of hatching. In the period following hatching, juveniles will remain in groups close to the female and will follow her around even over land between different pools.One female may take over the maternal duties for multiple groups of hatchlings (pods) from different parents. During this time, social hierarchies are established between the juveniles.Caiman Conservation StatusCrocodile Specialist Group (1996). Caiman crocodilus. 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. IUCN 2006. Retrieved on 06 May 2006.The Spectacled Caiman has actually benefited from commercial utilisation and over-hunting of other species within its range (the American Crocodile (crocodylus acutus), the Pit Viper (c. intermedius) and the Black Caiman (melanosuchus niger)), taking over habitat from which it would otherwise have been out-competed by healthy populations.Despite pressure from hunting and also collection for the pet trade, however, existing surveys suggest that populations are in relatively good condition in most areas (e.g. Venezuela).This seems to reflect the adaptability of the species, its reproductive potential and the increase in available habitat through the removal of competing species and an increase in man-made water bodies (e.g. Brazilian Panatal, Colombia, Venezuela).However, it is these factors which make it difficult to determine the overall status of the species, as populations are faring less well in other areas \u2013 surveys reveal severe depletion in El Salvador.\u00a0"

Spider monkeys are restricted to arboreal habitats, mainly in the top of the tree canopy. They range from sea level to higher ground. A recent intelligence comparison gives spider monkeys a value of a little above a gorillas intelligence, so it is reasonable to believe that spider monkeys are among the most intelligent New World monkeys. They are called spider monkeys because they look like spiders when they are suspended by their tails.",
            "characteristics": "The male Spider Monkey has a body length of 38 \u2013 48 centimetres, a tail length of 63 \u2013 82 centimetres and weighs around 9 \u2013 10 kilograms. The female Spider Monkey has a body length of 42 \u2013 57 centimetres, a tail length of 75 \u2013 92 centimetres and weighs 6 \u2013 8 kilograms. Males and females look very similar. Spider monkeys are usually all black, but some have flesh colored rings around their eyes and white chin whiskers.Their hair is generally coarse and stringy and they lack any under fur. Spider Monkey colors can be golden, red, buff, brown or black, with hands and feet generally black. These monkeys depend highly on their keen binocular vision. They have slender bodies and limbs with long narrow hands.The Spider Monkey has a prehensile tail that is muscular and tactile and is used as an extra hand. The tail is sometimes longer than the body. Both the underside and tip of the tail are used for climbing and grasping and so the spider monkey uses it like a fifth hand. When swinging by the tail, the hands are free to gather food.The Spider Monkey has hooked-shaped hands because its thumbs are either absent or reduced to a stump. Hands are like hooks with long, narrow palms, long curved fingers and no thumb. Head is small and their muzzle is prominent. They have thumbs on their feet only.The spider monkeys tail and supple shoulder joints allows it to swing quickly under branches (brachiate) without fear of snagging thumbs. Its feet are greatly elongated and their big toe is prehensile, working like hands to grasp thinner branches, as well as for better grip as it walks upright on two legs on broad branches.It may even stand upright on a branch using its tail as a third limb in a tripod arrangement with its two legs. When the monkey is on the lookout, it stands or walks on two feet, using the tail to hold on to a support.\u00a0",
            "diet": "Spider monkeys are frugivores preferring a diet of 90% fruit and seeds, feeding on the mature soft parts of a wide variety of fruits in which the seeds are swallowed along with the fruit. Spider monkeys also eat young leaves, flowers, aerial roots, sometimes bark and decaying wood, as well as honey.A very small part of the diet consists of insects, insect larvae and birds eggs. When feeding, they may hang by their tails and reach out for food with their hands.Spider monkeys can also pick up things with their tails. They eat large quantities of food over a relatively short period of time and they tend to feed by suspension while hanging, climbing or moving. They do not pick fruit and carry it to another location to be eaten.The lead female Spider monkey is often observed determining the forage route for the group. However if food is scarce they tend to divide into smaller groups. The largest groups of monkeys, sometimes up to 100 monkeys, are found in a big tree loaded with fruits.When they feed in a large tree, spider monkeys continuously adjust their positions so they are not too close to one another.Late comers wait until earlier arrivals leave before entering the tree. It appears that spider monkeys can be quarrelsome feeders if they are too close to one another and this spacing out reduces any conflict.During those months of the year when they have to depend on small, scattered sources of fruit, such as from palm trees, lone individuals and smaller aggregations are found moving through the forest. They avoid quarrelling at food sources with only enough ripe fruit at any one time to feed a few monkeys.In captivity Spider monkeys are fed celery, bananas, raisins, apples, oranges, carrots, monkey chow, dog chow, lettuce and wheat bread.\u00a0",
            "habitat": "Spider Monkeys live high in the canopy of the rainforest and seldom venture to the rainforest floor. Spider monkeys live in evergreen rainforests, semi deciduous and mangrove forests, lowland rainforests to mountain forests. In these forests they live mostly in the upper canopy, preferring undisturbed high forest, almost never coming to the ground. Spider monkeys prefer wet forests rather than dry forests.\u00a0",
            "behaviour": "Spider monkeys have been called \u2018the supreme acrobat of the forest\u2019. In the wild, the Spider monkey rarely comes down to the rainforest floor. Acrobatic and swift, Spider monkeys move through the trees, with one arm stride covering up to 40 feet.Spider monkeys are characterized by their long, slender limbs and great agility. They travel in small bands in forest trees, moving swiftly by making tremendous leaps, sprawling out like spiders and grasping tree limbs with their prehensile tails.Spider monkeys live in medium-sized, loosely associated groups of about 30 individuals. The females have a more active leading role than males, so their social system is thought to be matriarchal. Within the group, adult males can coexist peacefully, although there is a clear hierarchy determined by age.The group is centred on the females and their young. Males are dominant over females, but it is the females that make the main decisions for the group. Males may forage in small groups. Females and offspring often forage alone.At night Spider monkeys use sleeping trees which are usually tall enough so that the crown is free from the canopy beneath it having a broad open crown that has horizontally forked branches for prolonged resting postures. The sleeping trees are often chosen for their ability to provide a ready source of food. Sleeping high in a tree above the canopy also affords security from predators.Since the thumb is absent, the Spider monkeys grooming is not as developed as in other primates. They scratch themselves with hands and feet, but most of their social grooming is mothers grooming their young.Groups defend their ranges. Male Spider monkeys will mark their territory with secretions from chest glands. Anyone stumbling into spider monkey territory receives an unpleasant \u2018welcome\u2019 of screams, barks and rattling branches and thrown branches or faeces.The interactions will often begin with males, often along with one or two females, calling, which will bring other group members into the area.When males are within 100 metres of each other, they will mutually threaten with a great deal of bluster. They chase about in the trees, shaking branches and whoop and growl at each other. These noisy sessions can easily last for an hour or more but they seem to be strictly male affairs. Females remain quietly in the background. But troops rarely come to blows.Sometimes a male will occasionally scent mark branches by smearing saliva and a secretion that comes from a gland on his chest onto the branches, presumably to deposit his scent in the area.\u00a0",
            "reproduction": "The gestation period of the Spider Monkey is about 7 \u2013 8 months. Every 2 \u2013 3 years, a female spider monkey will give birth to one infant. No one else besides the mother looks after the baby.The spider monkey baby is continuously carried by the mother, clinging to her and at about 5 months of age it will begin riding on her back, wrapping its tail around the mothers tail for added security. It will be dependent on its mothers milk for 2 years.Infant spider monkeys at the age of 24 to 50 months old never ride on their mothers back but they will still stay close to her. They spend their time exploring, or chasing, grappling and jumping on others. They will play with others their same age or with adults. The Spider Monkey life span in the wild is about 27 years and 33 years in captivity.\u00a0",
            "conservation status": "The spider monkey is critically endangered, which means it is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the immediate future.Considered good to eat and because of their large body size, spider monkeys have been severely hunted throughout their range. They are easy to locate because they are noisy and travel in big groups.So spider monkeys are often extinct in areas easily accessible to people. There is also a profitable pet trade. They are also affected by habitat destruction, particularly logging, which removes the tall trees that they depend upon. They are also vulnerable because they have low maturation and reproduction rates.Three of the spider monkey species, the white-bellied spider monkey, brown-headed spider monkey and white- whiskered spider monkey are listed as Endangered by either USESA or IUCN. This means that these species have at least a 20% chance of going extinct in the wild within 20 years or 5 of their generations.The black-handed and black spider monkeys are listed as Vulnerable by IUCN \u2013 there is at least a 10% probability of extinction within 100 years. Only the black-faced black spider monkey is considered at Lower Risk (CITES II.) The population is estimated at 2,000 in isolated pockets.\u00a0",

            "desc": "Spiders are classified in the order Araneae, one of several orders within the larger class of arachnids, a group which also contains scorpions, mites, ticks and opiliones (harvestmen). There are more than 40,000 described species of spider. They are found all over the world, from the tropics to the Arctic. Spiders are even found living underwater in silken domes they supply with air and on the tops of mountains. Spiders occur in a large range of sizes from 6 millimetres to 10 \u2013 12 inches. All spiders have eight legs, although a few ant-mimicking species use their front legs to imitate antennae, which spiders lack. They are invertebrates (which means they do not have a backbone). They are predatory animals that have no wings and no chewing mouth parts. Instead, like other arachnids, they have a tiny proboscis which they use to suck up the liquid parts of their prey. However, spiders are able to eat their own silk.",
            "spider vision": "Most spiders have eight eyes in various arrangements. Their eyes are single lenses rather than compound eyes, ranging from simple light/dark-receptors to eyes rivaling those of a pigeon (in some jumping spiders). Some species of the Haplogynae family have six eyes, although some have eight (Plectreuridae), four (Tetrablemma) or even two (most Caponiidae) eyes. Sometimes one pair of eyes is better developed than the rest, or even, in some cave species, there are no eyes at all. Several families of hunting spiders, such as jumping spiders and wolf spiders, have fair to excellent vision. The main pair of eyes in jumping spiders even see in color.",
            "spider web": "Spiders produce seven kinds of silk (a thin, strong protein strand), ranging from sticky stuff to trap and wrap their prey to super strong threads for support. They also use their silk as parachutes and to shelter themselves and their young. The various types of silk are produced by different specialized silk glands and nozzles called spinnerets most commonly found on the end of the abdomen.No one spider is able to produce the full range of silk. Many species use it to trap insects in webs, although there are also many species that hunt freely. Silk can be used to aid in climbing, form smooth walls for burrows, build egg sacs, wrap prey and temporarily hold sperm, among other applications.",
            "spider venom": "All spiders except those in the families Uloboridae and Holarchaeidae and in the suborder Mesothelae (together about 350 species) have fangs and can inject venom to protect themselves or to kill their prey. Only about 200 species, however, have bites that can pose health problems to humans. Many larger species have bites that may be quite painful, but will not produce lasting health concerns. Read\u00a0 more in our post about venomous spiders!",
            "spider digestion and circulation": "Digestion is carried out internally and externally. Spiders that do not have powerful chelicerae, secrete digestive fluids into their prey from a series of ducts perforating their chelicerae. These digestive fluids dissolve the preys internal tissues. Then the spider feeds by sucking the partially digested fluids out. Other species with more powerfully built chelicerae masticate the entire body of their prey and leave behind only a relatively small residue of indigestible materials.Spiders have an open circulatory system which means they do not have true blood, or veins to convey it. Rather, their bodies are filled with haemolymph, which is pumped through arteries by a heart into spaces called sinuses surrounding their internal organs.",
            "spider reproduction and life cycle": "Spiders are oviparous, which means their young come from eggs. The spider life cycle progresses through three stages: the embryonic, the larval, and the nympho-imaginal.Spiders reproduce by means of eggs, which are packed into silk bundles called egg sacs. They often use elaborate mating rituals (especially jumping spiders) to allow conspecifics to identify each other and to allow the male to approach and inseminate the female without triggering a predatory response. If the approach signals are exchanged correctly, the male spider must (in most cases) make a timely departure after mating to escape before the females normal predatory instincts return and eats him. Male spiders are usually smaller than female spiders.The time between when an egg is fertilized and when the spider begins to take the shape of an adult spider is referred to as the \u2019embryonic stage\u2019. As the spider enters the larval stage, it begins to look more and more like a full grown spider. It enters the larval stage as a prelarva and, through subsequent molts, reaches its larval form, a spider-shaped animal feeding off its yolk supply.After a few more molts (also called instars) body structures become differentiated. Soon, all organ systems are complete and the animal begins to hunt on its own. It has reached the nympho-imaginal stage.This stage is differentiated into two sub-stages: the nymph, or juvenile stage and the imago, or adult stage. A spider does not become sexually mature until it makes the transition from nymph to imago. Once a spider has reached the imago stage, it will remain there until its death. After sexual maturity is reached, the general rule is that they stop molting, but the females of some non-araneomorph species will continue to molt the rest of their lives.",
            "spider life span": "Many spiders may only live for about a year, but a number will live two years or more, overwintering in sheltered areas. The annual influx of \u2018outdoor\u2019 spiders entering into houses in the autumn is because they search for a warm place to spend the winter. It is common for female tarantulas to live up to twenty years.How do spiders protect themseleves?All spiders will attempt to protect themselves by biting, especially if they are unable to flee. Some tarantulas have a second kind of defence, a patch of urticating hairs, or urticating setae, on their abdomens, which is generally absent on modern spiders. These ultra-fine hairs causes irritation and sometimes even allergic reactions in the attacker. Certain other species have specialized defence tactics. For example, the golden wheeling spider (Carparachne aureoflava) of the desert of Namibia escapes tarantula hawks (a species of wasp that lays its eggs in a paralyzed spider so the larvae have enough food when they hatch) by flipping onto its side and cart wheeling away.\u00a0"

These Dolphins in general all share common characteristics.\u00a0Spinner Dolphins have slender bodies and long, thin beaks (except for the Atlantic short-snouted spinner). Their flippers are small and pointed at the tips. Their coloring is in shades of dark grey, light grey and white. Most Spinner Dolphins have white bellies.",
            "spinner dolphin behaviour": "Spinner Dolphins congregate in groups that vary from just a few dolphins to great schools numbering in the thousands. These Dolphins are famous for their acrobatic displays in which they will spin longitudinally along their axis as they leap through the air. They are also keen bow-riders. The reason for the animals spinning is not known.One suggestion is that the great cauldron of bubbles created on exit and re-entry may act as a target for echolocation by other individuals in the school. It may also be simply play-acting. Individuals have been spotted completing at least 14 spinning jumps in quick succession.",
            "diet": "Spinner Dolphins tend to do most of their hunting at night as the \u2018scattering layer\u2019 of marine life, which has spent the day at depths of 3000 feet, rises toward the surface to feed on microscopic plant material. Their diet is composed of fish, jellyfish, euphausiids (or krill), squid, shell-less snails, as well as copepods (a group of small crustaceans found in the sea and nearly every freshwater habitat).Before diving into the layer, the pod of dolphins gather together in a kind of rally as if they are about to embark on a dangerous journey. These dolphins are taking a great risk because other predators have gathered as well, such as sharks, which are natural predators of dolphins.Spinner Dolphins form small subgroups and spread out across the sea. Many times, the dolphins will dive down into the dark oceans at 800 feet, or more. Even though Spinner Dolphins have more teeth than any other dolphin (between 45 to 65 sharp, pointed teeth in each side of both the upper and lower jaws), they do not use them to chew their prey but rather to grasp and immobilize their prey.",
            "spinner dolphin communication": "Spinner Dolphin sounds appear to be in the form of click-whistles and pulse sounds which are a mix of echolocation and communication. Echolocation sounds enable dolphins to track objects in dim or dark water and to see much further than their eyes will allow. Their complex array of whistle sounds are the way that dolphins talk to one another. The spinners can even identify themselves with sounds they make while trailing bubbles from their blowholes.They also communicate by slapping the water with various body parts. For instance, \u2018nose-outs\u2019 occur when beak is thrust from the surface. This action is commonly used when the pod is emerging from a rest period. \u2018Tail slaps\u2019 are often used to indicate impending danger or to signal a dive.Head slaps, side slaps and back slaps are most frequently seen as the school begins to pick up speed. Last, and most spectacular, are the spins themselves. Many animals spin repeatedly, with each spin tending to get smaller and smaller, finally finishing up with an emphatic side slap.",
            "reproduction": "Females reach sexual maturity at about 4 to 7 years, males at about 7 to 10 years. A newborn calf averages 32 inches (80 centimetres) in length. The gestation period is 10 and a half months and calving is between 2 to 3 years. Calves nurse from 1 to 2 years.",
            "spinner dolphin predators": "Known predators of the Spinner Dolphins are sharks, killer whales and possibly false killer whales, pygmy killer whales and pilot whales.\u00a0Spinner Dolphin ConservationSpinner Dolphins are classed as an endangered species.Whitebelly and eastern spinner dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific have suffered enormous population losses as a result of entanglement in the nets of tuna fishermen. It is not yet known why they swim in herds above schools of yellowfin tuna. Fishermen are aware of this behaviour and instead of looking for the tuna, they seek out the spinner dolphins instead, knowing the yellowfin tuna will be beneath them. When they find them, they encircle the herd with large nets called \u2018purse seine\u2019 nets, capturing the dolphins along with the tuna.It is believed that the stock has declined by as much as 80% since the 1960s, when purse seining operations began. They do well in captivity and have been displayed in Hawaii and elsewhere in the U.S., Indonesia, the Philippines and Hong Kong."

There are around 60 species of these achelate crustaceans which are split into 12 genera. Spiny lobsters are found in almost all warm seas, including the Caribbean and the Mediterranean Sea, in coastal waters off Southeast Asia and Australia, and off the coast of South Africa. These lobsters are characterized by their lack of front claws on the front of their bodies and their very thick and oversized antennae, which is where the word \u2018spiny\u2019 comes from.",
            "lifespan": "Spiny lobsters have a relatively long lifespan. Some species of this animal can live for up to 50 years old!\u00a0",
            "diet": "The spiny lobster is an omnivore, feeding on live prey, decaying matter, and plants. Typical prey include sea urchins, snails, crabs, sea hares, mussels, and clams. They spend their day hiding, and come out at night to feed.\u00a0",
            "behavior": "Spiny lobsters are nocturnal animals and spend the day hiding in crevices and rocks. They only occasionally venturing out at night to seek food. To deter predators, it flexes its tail to escape backwards and lets out a loud screech made by the antennae of the spiny lobsters rubbing against a smooth part of the exoskeleton.Spiny lobsters are social animals, although recent research shows that healthy lobsters move away from infected ones, leaving the diseased lobsters to fend for themselves.These animals undertake migration. During migration, groups of up to 50 spiny lobsters move in single file, keeping contact with each other with their antennae. They navigate using scent and taste, as well as through their ability to detect the Earth\u2019s magnetic field.\u00a0",
            "reproduction": "The time and age at which spiny lobsters mate and reproduce depends on their species, location and water temperature. Some species spawn at certain times of the year, while others can reproduce all year round. On average, the spiny lobster reaches sexual maturity at around 5 to 9 years for females and 3 to 6 years for males.Males transfer spermatophores directly into the female\u2019s sternum during mating. The female can carry between 120,000 to 680,000 fertilized eggs, which she does so for around 10 weeks before they hatch.Once hatched, the spiny lobster larvae do not resemble adults. They are zooplankton that feed on plankton and go through several molts and larval stages. They sink to the bottom of the ocean, where they eat small crabs, amphipods, and isopods until they are big enough to take larger prey.It can be difficult to know the exact age of a spiny lobster because of the amount that it molts. In some areas, these animals cannot be caught until they are a certain size, because this means they will be of a certain age, too.\u00a0",
            "location and habitat": "Spiny lobsters live in tropical oceans worldwide, most commonly in the Caribbean and Mediterranean, in coastal waters off Southeast Asia and Australia, and off the coast of South Africa. They are mostly found at the bottom of the ocean floor, where their prey can also be found.\u00a0Conservation StatusSpiny lobsters are commercially fished across almost all their range. While there is insufficient data for conservation status classification and most are listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List, it is safe to say these animals are at threat from overfishing.They are caught for their meat, which in some areas is exported worldwide, and in others is kept more of a local delicacy. They are of huge economic importance to many places and, in some areas, spiny lobster fisheries are the largest commercial fisheries. For example, in the Bahamas, they are the biggest food export.Climate change and change to the spiny lobster habitat may also affect their numbers.Despite this, while populations of spiny lobsters are declining, it is not thought that any are at risk from extinction soon.\u00a0",

For example, they are the biggest food export of the Bahamas.However, they also have some natural predators, too. In the wild, they can be eaten by sea otters, octopuses, sharks, and bony fishes.\u00a0Spiny Lobster FAQsHow many species of spiny lobster are there?There are at least 60 species of spiny lobster! These species are split into 12 extant genera. We go into more detail about these below.Can you eat spiny lobster?Yes! Spiny lobsters are edible and are actually caught for their meat across their range. In some areas, they are exported for consumption worldwide, while other catches are kept closer to their place of origin and served as a local delicacy. Often, lobster tails are sold separately.Some species of this lobster are captured in lobster traps or hand caught by divers and sold live in tanks. Gill nets and trammel nets are also used to catch these lobsters.Where do spiny lobsters live?Spiny lobsters reside all over the world, in tropical oceans. They are mostly found in the Caribbean and Mediterranean and off Southeast Asia, Australia and South Africa. They live on the bottom of the seabed, under rocks and in crevices.What do spiny lobsters eat?Spiny lobsters are omnivores. They eat both dead and alive sea urchins, snails, crabs, sea hares, mussels, and clams. They also eat plants.How do lobsters communicate?Lobsters cannot produce verbal sounds because they do not have any vocal chords. In fact, they communicate mostly using urine. To put it very simply, they squirt pee at each other\u2019s faces to communicate!Lobsters urinate from their faces so this is easy for them to do. Pheromones are injected into their urine, and so, when they pee, they release these pheromones and can lets other lobsters know how they are feeling.Do lobsters mate for life?It is a popular theory that lobsters mate for life, but in reality, it isn\u2019t true. These animals can create a monogamous bond, but it only lasts for two weeks.How long can lobsters live out of water?Lobsters can live for around one to two days out of water, if they are kept cool, moist and refrigerated. Because they are gill breathers, they can be kept alive for a short amount of time with newspaper and/or seaweed. This helps to keep them moist.\u00a0Spiny Lobster SpeciesThere are about 60 species of spiny lobster, split into 12 extant genera: Jasus, Justitia, Linuparus, Nupalirus, Palibythus, Palinurellus, Palinurus, Palinustus, Panulirus, Projasus, Puerulus and Sagmariasus.Here are some of the most well-known spiny lobsters.Caribbean spiny lobsterGenus: PanulirusSpecies: Panulirus argusThe Caribbean spiny lobster can be found on reefs and in mangrove swamps in the western Atlantic Ocean. They can be found at depths of up to 100 m (330 ft).They are generally olive greenish or brown, but can be tan to mahogany. There is a scattering of yellowish to cream-colored spots on their carapace and larger yellow to cream-colored spots on the abdomen. They have no pair of antennae that are longer than the body. Their body can be 60 cm (24 in) long.The Caribbean spiny lobster is a popular human food is the most important food export of the Bahamas. In Florida, there is a season where the spiny lobster may be taken, usually from the beginning of August to the end of March, to protect the species during its main breeding season.European spiny lobsterGenus: PanulirusSpecies: Palinurus elephasThe European spiny lobster is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, from southern Norway to Morocco and the Azores, and in the Mediterranean Sea. It lives on rocky exposed coasts below the intertidal zone, mainly at depths of 20 to 70 metres (66 to 230 ft).These lobsters are reddish-brown with yellow spots. Their antennae are very heavy and spiny, are tapering and even longer than the body. They can reach up to 60 cm (24 in) long.The European spiny lobster is widely caught for food around the Mediterranean Sea, mostly with lobster pots, and is also caught less intensively off the Atlantic Coasts of Ireland, Portugal, France and England. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.Painted rock lobsterGenus: PanulirusSpecies: Panulirus versicolorThe painted rock lobster is found in tropical reefs in the Indo-Pacific. It occurs in the shallow tropical waters, in coral reef ecosystems and on seaward edges of the reef plateau, at depths up to 15 metres (49 ft). It is one of the three most common varieties of spiny lobster in Sri Lanka, alongside Panulirus homarus and Panulirus ornatus.These lobsters are white, pink and black in color, with a green abdomen with transverse black and white bands. The legs are dark blue to black with white stripes and the tail is blue-green. Its first pair of antennae are double ended and the second hard and spiny. The painted rock lobster usually grows up to 40 centimetres (16 in) long.The painted rock lobster is commercially exploited, which has led to its rarefaction and even disappearance in many places. Despite this, it is still listed as Least Concern by the IUCN Red List, possibly due to the fact its range includes many protected areas.California spiny lobsterGenus: PanulirusSpecies: Panulirus interruptusThe California spiny lobster is found in the eastern Pacific Ocean from Monterey Bay, California, to the Gulf of Tehuantepec, Mexico. They live among rocks at depths of up to 65 m (213 ft)The California spiny lobster is one of the largest spiny lobster species and typically grows to a length of 30 cm (12 in).

They reside in shallow rocky reefs and muddy substrates, at depths down to 40 m (131 ft).They are a greenish-grey color with a thin white band near the hind edge of each segment, which makes them easily distinguishable from other spiny lobster species. They can grow to a length of about 40 cm (16 in).The mud spiny lobster is caught for human consumption. Despite the fact its population is declining due to fishing, it is still listed as Least Concern by the IUCN Red List.Southern rock lobsterGenus: JasusSpecies: Jasus edwardsiiThe southern rock lobster, also known as the red rock lobster, or the spiny rock lobster, is found throughout coastal waters of southern Australia and New Zealand including the Chatham Islands. They live in and around reefs at depths ranging from 5 to 200 metres (16 to 660 ft) deep at the continental shelf.These lobsters can be dark red and orange above with paler yellowish abdomens, or grey-green brown with the paler underside. They usually grow to 230 millimetres (9.1 in) in length and can often exceed 8 kilograms (18 lb)!The southern rock lobster is not commercially farmed yet and is currently listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.Western rock lobsterGenus: PanulirusSpecies: Panulirus cygnusThe western rock lobster is found off the west coast of Australia, from Hamelin Bay to the North West Cape. They vary in color from a brownish purple to a pale color and have a maximum weight of 5 kg (11 lb). They measure 80 to 100 millimetres (3.1 to 3.9 in) in length.This spiny lobster makes up 20% of value of Australia\u2019s total fishing industry, with the annual catch being 8,000 to 15,000 tonnes. Despite this, they are still listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.Longlegged spiny lobsterGenus: PanulirusSpecies: Panulirus longipesThe longlegged spiny lobster is found in the tropical Indo-Pacific region and resides on shallow rocky and coral reefs usually at depths less than about 18 m (59 ft), although can be found as deep as 122 m (400 ft).hhere are two subspecies; P. l. longipes and P. l. bispinosus. These lobsters are usually dark brown or bluish-brown in color and there are numerous circular white spots on their abdomen and fewer spots on other parts of the body.The longlegged spiny lobster is caught throughout most of its range for human consumption and it is likely that it is being overfished in parts of its range. Despite this, it is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.Cape rock lobsterGenus: JasusSpecies: Jasus lalandiiThe Cape rock lobster, also known as the West Coast rock lobster, is found off the coast of Southern Africa, in shallow waters. It can reside as deep as 46 metres (150 ft) and is usually found on rocky bottoms.This spiny lobster is orange to red-brown in color with a tail fan of orange, blue and green. It may grow up to a total length of 46 centimetres (18 in).The Cape rock lobster is widely caught for its meat, with over 6,500 t being caught annually. To prevent this spiny lobster from being overfished, individual fishing quotas are allocated by the Republic of South Africa to fishermen and companies.It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.Spotted spiny lobsterGenus: PanulirusSpecies: Panulirus guttatusThe spotted spiny lobster, also known as the Guinea chick lobster, is found in the tropical West Atlantic and Caribbean Sea but it also extends into the Gulf of Mexico. It resides on rocky reefs in shallow water, at depths down to about 23 metres (75 ft).This spiny lobster has a length of 15 cm (6 in), with a purplish-black body color and round white spots. Its legs are dark and are also spotted white.The spotted spun lobster is caught for its meat, but is mostly marketed locally and eaten fresh. Because it is not currently the subject of commercial fishing, its populations have remained stable and is currently listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.Brown spiny lobsterGenus: PanulirusSpecies: Panulirus echinatusThe brown spiny lobster is found in the tropical western Atlantic Ocean and central Atlantic Islands, off the coasts of northern Brazil and Cape Verde, Saint Helena, Ascension Island, Tristan da Cunha and the Canary Islands. It resides about 35 m (115 ft) deep, on rocks and among boulders.This spiny lobster is brown in color with large white rounded spots. It differs from other species by having just two large spines on the antennular plate. Males usually grow to 19 cm (7.5 in) and females 15 cm (6 in).The brown spiny lobster has a wide distribution and seems to be very common within that range. However, it is harvested in most of the areas in which it is found and in Saint Helena and the Cape Verde Islands is fished commercially. It is thought to be declining in population due to fishing, although is still listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.Hawaiian spiny lobsterGenus: PanulirusSpecies: Panulirus marginatusThe Hawaiian spiny lobster is found on the Hawaiian Islands to the Northwest where the Pearl and Hermes Atoll is. They are usually found in shallow waters but have been found up to 143 m deep.This spiny lobster is yellowish, reddish and brownish in color, with a distinct blue tail. They can reach a total body length of about 40 cm.The Hawaiian spiny lobster has historically been caught commercially, particularly because they are easy to catch due to being found in shallow waters. Despite this, they are now a protected species in Hawaii and therefore guarded by specific laws to preserve their population. They are not allowed to be caught between May to August and no females with eggs may be taken. There is also a minimum size limit on individuals allowed to be taken.Easter Island spiny lobsterGenus: PanulirusSpecies: Panulirus pascuensisThe Easter Island spiny lobster is found around Easter Island and the Pitcairn Islands in the Pacific Ocean. It resides at depths of up to 5 metres (16 ft), on rocky shores.This spiny lobster can reach a total length of between 15 to 25 centimetres (6 to 10 in) and is dark greenish purple in color. Its first pair of antennae are forked and the second pair are long, thick and spiny. The base of its tail fan has pale spots.The Easter Island spiny lobster is a popular food in its range, with its main threat thought to be tourism through fishing. This lobster is often the seafood dish of choice to serve to tourists at local restaurants. Despite this, it is listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List.St Paul rock lobsterGenus: JasusSpecies: Jasus paulensisThe St Paul rock lobster is found in the waters around Saint Paul Island in the southern Indian Ocean and around Tristan da Cunha in the southern Atlantic Ocean. It is quite uncommon throughout its range, usually residing at depths between 10 and 35 m (33 and 115 ft) but occasionally down to about 60 metres (200 ft).This spiny lobster usually reaches a total length of about 34 cm (13 in). They are fished commercially, although they are listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List.Juan Fern\u00e1ndez rock lobsterGenus: JasusSpecies: Jasus frontalisThe Juan Fern\u00e1ndez rock lobster is found around the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez and Desventuradas Islands in the south-eastern Pacific Ocean.

The St. Andrew\u2019s Cross Spider is very similar in appearance to the closely related north Queensland species, Argiope aetherea (another common, large orb-web spider). The X shape is called the St. Andrew\u2019s cross because it is believed that the saint was martyred on a cross of this shape rather than the conventional cross shape. \u00a0",
            "st andrew\u2019s cross spider habitat and spider webs": "Like many other spiders, only the female St. Andrews Cross spider builds the webs. These spiders build medium-sized orb webs, occupied day and night, on low shrubby vegetation.These orb webs are 38 \u2013 50 millimetres wide and contain only 2 stabilimentum (conspicuous silk structures). Argiope versicolor, which is found inland, makes the \u2018full\u2019 cross with 4 stabilimentum. The zigzag lines of their webs match their leg positions, which lead some people to suggest that this helps give the appearance of longer legs. Some spiders build a single vertical line, yet others a patch of zigzags in the centre of the web. No matter what the design is, this spider sits right in the middle of the web at all times.When prey is caught in the web, the spider throws out broad swathes of white silk to immobilise the prey, then rapidly rotates it to tighten the binding before administering the fatal bite. Small spiders which are unable to rotate the prey, run around the prey instead as they throw out binding silk.When threatened, the spider responds, either by dropping from the web or shaking it so vigorously that both spider and stabilimentum become a blur which confuses the attacker. These measures do not always succeed, as indicated by empty, damaged webs and the presence of these spiders as food in the mud cells of wasps.",
            "st andrew\u2019s cross spider diet": "St. Andrews Cross spiders prey includes flies, moths, butterflies, beetles and bees. These are usually secured by silk wrapping into a neat parcel before being bitten \u2013 although smaller prey may be bitten first.",
            "reproduction": "Mating occurs in summer-autumn The male spider is much smaller than the female and unassumingly marked. When it is time to mate, he spins a companion web alongside the females. After mating, the female lays her eggs, placing her egg sac into the web. The sac contains between 400 and 1,400 eggs. These eggs hatch in autumn, however, the spiderlings overwinter in the sac and emerge during the spring. The egg sac is composed of multiple layers of silk and designed to protect its contents from damage; however, many species of insects have been observed to parasite the egg sacs.",
            "venom": "The bite of the St Andrews Cross Spider is of low risk to humans. St Andrews Cross Spiders are a non-aggressive group of spiders. There are no reported instances of any serious consequences of human contact with these spiders except the fright of walking into their large web and the spider crawling over the person involved.St Andrews Cross Spiders are spectacular and may be quite alarming if one is not familiar with them, however, they are not dangerous. They might bite if grabbed, however, other than for defence they have no interest in biting humans. Their venom is not regarded as a serious medical problem for humans.\u00a0"

            "desc": "Stag beetles belong to the family Lucanidae. They are a group of about 1,200 species. Stag beetles can be found in Southern and central Europe. In Britain, they are found in southern and southeastern areas of England. Some species grow to 8 centimetres (3\u00bc inches), but most are about 5 centimetres (2 inches). Stag beetles have a dark, violet-brown elytra (wing cases) with reddish-brown antlers (females antlers are much smaller than the males).  Adult male stag beetles emerge in May or June, depending on the weather, followed shortly after by the females. The male has strong wings underneath the wing cases (elytra) and he flies at dusk in search of females. The flight can be rather erratic and the beetle sometimes flies indoors through open windows or doors, attracted by the light.",
            "s reproduction": "Mating rituals involve the male stag beetle opening his antlers wide and walking around actually \u2018showing off\u2019. Two males will fight if they interested in the same female. Injuries are rare, however, the stronger beetle will turn its opponent on its back. It is more a show of aggression and dominance than a dangerous fight.After mating, the female finds an area of moist decaying wood in which to lay her eggs. She will seek out logs and old tree stumps in parks, gardens and hedgerows. When she has laid her eggs, she dies and the male does not last much longer.Each egg hatches into a creamy colored larvae, looking like a fat, wrinkly grub with an orangey-brown head and six stubby legs. It has tough jaws for tearing up and chewing decaying wood. This type of food is not very nourishing, so it takes three to five years before the larvae is ready to turn into a pupa.The adult beetle develops inside this pupae case, which remains hidden inside a decaying tree stump all through the winter. The fully-formed adult beetle will not emerge until the weather becomes warmer in May or June of the following year. The cycle then starts over again, as the males fly off in search of a mate. The flight season lasts only until August and by the time winter arrives, all the adult beetles have died.Facts About Stag BeetlesThe English name is derived from the large and distinctive mandibles found on the males of most species, which resemble the antlers of deer stags.A well-known species in much of Europe is \u2018Lucanus cervus\u2019, referred to in Britain as \u2018the\u2019 stag beetle (it is the largest British terrestrial insect).Stag beetles inhabit broad-leaved woodlands, especially oak, but also parks and gardens where there are hedgerows, tree stumps and logs.Male stag beetles use their jaws to wrestle each other for favoured mating sites, but despite their often fearsome appearance they are not normally aggressive to humans.Female stag beetles are usually smaller than the males, with mandibles in normal proportion for a beetle.Unfortunately, the stag beetle is now rare in Britain, mainly due to loss of suitable habitat.\u00a0"

            "desc": "Stellers sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas) is a an extinct sirenian described by Georg Wilhelm Steller in 1741. Most of what we know about Steller\u2019s sea cow comes from Steller\u2019s observations. It belonged to the order Sirenia and the family Dugongidae, of which the dugong (Dugong dugon) is the sole living member. The other living members of the order Sirenia are three species of manatee, which are often called sea cows, but are a different species to Steller\u2019s. The sea cow was found only around the Commander Islands in the Bering Sea between Alaska and Russia, and would have reached weights of 8 to 10 t (8.8 to 11.0 short tons) and lengths up to 9 m (30 ft). It had a forked tail, like those of whales or dugongs, and fed mainly on kelp. Stellers sea cow became extinct in the 18th century and was hunted to extinction for its meat, fat, and hide. It was a very slow-moving animal, meaning it was easy to catch and was therefore extinct within 27 years of its discovery.",
            "steller\u2019s sea cow lifespan": "The lifespan of the extinct Steller\u2019s sea cow is unknown.",
            "steller\u2019s sea cow diet": "Sea cows were herbivores and actually considered to be algivores, as their main source of food was kelp. It is probable they fed on many different types of kelp. However, they fed only on the soft parts of the plant, which meant that the tougher part often turned up washed up on the shore. It is thought Steller\u2019s sea cow also fed on seagrass, but not as much as kelp.",
            "steller\u2019s sea cow behavior": "Sea cows were highly social, living in small family groups. These animals were monogamous, with mothers fiercely protecting their young and males defending their females. Steller reported that as a female was being captured, a group of other sea cows attacked the hunting boat by ramming it, and after the hunt, her mate followed the boat to shore, even after the captured animal had died.Herds of these marine mammals would often congregate in shallow waters near the shore, sometimes so close that hunters could simply wade out to them. They were also often found near the mouths of stream or rivers, which suggests they could not tolerate drinking marine water.Steller\u2019s sea cow spent most of the day feeding, only lifting its head every 4 to 5 minutes for breathing. Because of its buoyancy, it is thought the sea cow only had access to food no deeper than 1 m (3.3 ft) below the tide. Steller also noted that the sea cow grew thin during winter, which may have indicated a period of fasting when there was low kelp growth.The sea cow was a slow moving animal that, during grazing, swam by moving its tail from side to side. They used their fore limbs for swimming, feeding, walking in shallow water, and for defending itself. After feeding, they slept on their backs.These aquatic mammals were not very vocal. They only made heavy breathing sounds, raspy snorting similar to a horse, and sighs.",
            "reproduction": "There is little known about the Steller\u2019s sea cow reproduction habits. We know they were monogamous and it is thought their mating season was around the early spring, with most calves born in the autumn. Despite this, offspring were observed to be born all year round.The litter size was one calf, and their gestation period was over a year long. Both parents exhibited parental care towards the calves.",
            "steller\u2019s sea cow location and habitat": "Stellers sea cow was thought to inhabit the North Pacific Ocean, however their range was limited to the coastal waters of the Komandorskiye and Blizhnie Islands in the Bering Sea. Despite this, fossils have been found as far south as the southern coast of California.These animals were found mostly in cold, shallow, coastal marine waters rich in algae and sea grass. Herds could also be found near the mouths of streams or freshwater rivers.Steller\u2019s Sea Cow Conservation StatusIt is not known when Stellers sea cow became extinct, but it is thought the last individual had died out by 1768. The main reason for their extinction was hunting by humans, with almost all of the animal being used for something.Their meat was said to have tasted similar to corned beef, though it was tougher, redder, and needed to be cooked longer. It was abundant on the animal, and slow to spoil, too. The fat could be used for cooking and as an odorless lamp oil, and the milk from females could be drunk or made into butter. Their leathery hide was also used to make clothing such as shoes and belts.Often, because sea cows would gather in shallow areas, hunters would simply wade out to an individual, spear it, and then allow the animal to swim off, hoping that it would later die and drift to shore. The hardest part of hunting these animals was getting them back to the shore because they were so heavy.",
            "predators": "The natural predators of Stellers sea cow, and whether it actually had any, are unknown. However, it has been guessed that these animals were probably hunted by killer whales and sharks. That being said, the buoyancy of the sea cow would have made it difficult for a killer whale to kill, and the kelp forests in which the sea cow lived may have deterred sharks from going near them.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "desc": "Stingless bees are a large group of bees, comprising the tribe Meliponini (sometimes called stingless honey bees) in the family Apidae. They are closely related to the common honey bees, carpenter bees, orchid bees and bumblebees. The common name is slightly misleading, as a great many bee species, especially in the family Andrenidae, are incapable of stinging. Stingless bees can be found in most tropical or subtropical regions of the world, such as Australia, Africa, Southeast Asia and parts of Mexico and Brazil. The majority of native eusocial bees of Central and South America are stingless bees, although only a few of them produce honey on a scale such that they are farmed by humans.",
            "stingless bee behaviour": "Unlike true honey bees, whose female bees may become workers or queens strictly depending on what kind of food they receive as larvae (queens are fed royal jelly and workers are fed pollen), the caste system is commonly based simply on the amount of pollen consumed.As stingless bees are harmless to humans, they have become an increasingly attractive addition to the suburban backyard. Most stingless beekeepers do not keep the bees for honey but rather for the pleasure of conserving a native species whose original habitat is declining due to human development. In return, the bees pollinate crops, garden flowers and bushland during their search for nectar and pollen.",
            "stingless bee hives": "Stingless bees usually nest in hollow trunks, tree branches, or rock crevices but they have also been encountered in wall cavities, old rubbish bins, water metres and storage drums. Many beekeepers keep the bees in their original log hive or transfer them to a wooden box, as this makes it easier to control the hive.Stingless bees store pollen and honey in large egg-shaped pots made of beeswax, typically mixed with various types of plant resin (sometimes called \u2018propolis\u2019).These pots are often arranged around a central set of horizontal brood combs, where the larval bees are housed. When the young worker bees emerge from their cells, they tend to remain inside the hive, performing different jobs. As workers age, they become guards or foragers.Unlike honey bees, stingless bee larvae are not fed directly. The pollen and nectar are placed in a cell, an egg is laid, and the cell is sealed until the adult bee emerges after pupation (\u2018mass provisioning\u2019). At any one time, hives can contain anywhere from 300 \u2013 80,000 workers, depending on species.",
            "stingless bee honey production": "In warm areas of Australia, these bees can be used for minor honey production. They may also be kept successfully in boxes in these areas. Special methods are being developed to harvest moderate amounts of honey from stingless bees in these areas without causing harm.Stingless bees also collect nectar, which they store in an extension of their gut called a crop. Back at the hive, the bees ripen or dehydrate the nectar droplets by spinning them inside their mouthparts until honey is formed. Ripening concentrates the nectar and increases the sugar content, though it is not nearly as concentrated as the honey from true honeybees. It is much thinner in consistency and more prone to spoiling.Unlike a hive of commercial honeybees, which can produce 75 kilograms of honey a year, a hive of stingless bees produces less than one kilogram. Stingless Bees produce a different tasting honey which is a mix of sweet and sour with a hint of lemon. The taste comes from plant resins which the bees use to build their hives and honey pots and varies depending on the flowers and trees visited.",
            "stingless bee pollination": "Australian farmers rely heavily on the introduced Western honey bee to pollinate their crops. However, for some crops native bees may be better pollinators. Stingless bees have been shown to be valuable pollinators of crops such as macadamias and mangoes. They may also benefit strawberries, watermelons, citrus, avocados, lychees and many others.Research into the use of stingless bees for crop pollination in Australia is still in its very early stages, but these bees show great potential.Native Americans previously and still do keep these bees as pets."

The Stoat is also known as the Short-tailed weasel and the Ermine. Stoats are found throughout mainland Britain in a variety of habitats. Stoats are absent from Mediterranean countries and Southern Europe. They are considered to be the most widespread mustelid. The Stoat pre-breeding season population is estimated to be 462,000 adults. The Stoat has an average head and body length of between 16 and 31 centimetres and stoats in Britain can weigh from 90 to 445 grams. Male stoats usually measure 29 centimetres with a tail length of 11 centimetres and females around 26 centimetres with a 9 centimetre tail length. Male stoats are larger than females.",

Where there is suitable food, they occur in a wide range of habitats from lowland forests and even towns.Stoats make nests of grass and leaves in hollow trunks, mole hills, walls, banks, burrows, rock crevices (dry stone walls for example) or thickets. The female stoat is territorial in the breeding season, however, male stoats are not.",
            "diet": "Stoats are largely carnivorous and their primary food source is the rabbit, despite being many times its own weight, supplemented with small rodents, (such as voles and mice), hares and birds. It also eats insects, fish, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates. When food is scarce they will eat carrion (dead animal carcasses). It is a very skilful tree climber and, like a squirrel, can descend a trunk headfirst.The stoat is capable of killing animals much larger than itself. When it is able to obtain more meat than it can eat, it will engage in \u2018surplus killing\u2019 and often stores the extra food for later. Stoats kill their prey by a bite to the back of the neck and may travel as far as 8 kilometres in one hunt. Stoats are fierce predators and can move at speeds of 20 miles per hour when hunting.In most areas in which stoats and weasels co-exist, the weasel generally takes smaller prey and the stoat slightly larger prey. The larger male stoats generally take larger prey than females.",
            "behaviour": "The stoat is territorial and intolerant of others in its range, especially others of the same sex. The stoat typically uses several dens, often taken from prey species. It usually travels alone, except when it is mating or is a mother with older offspring.Stoat communication occurs mainly by scent, since the stoat has a sensitive olfactory system (relating to sense of smell). As a result, much of this communication is missed by human observers. However, stoats are believed to identify females in estrus by scent and also the sex, health and age of prey.Some kinds of rodents such as voles have counter-adapted by being able to shut down reproduction (which makes females slower and easier to catch) if they smell the odour of stoats. The stoats visual resolution is lower than that of humans and color vision is poor, although night vision is superior. Tactile information is presented by the vibrissae, or whiskers. When alarmed, a stoat can release a powerful musky smell from its anal glands.",
            "reproduction": "Stoats mate in May to June followed by a period of delayed implantation. Mating occurs during the breeding season with multiple partners and is often forced by the male, who does not help raise the young. Implantation of the fertilised egg in the wall of the uterus is delayed for 280 days, however, the gestation period after this is just 21 \u2013 28 days, so the young are born in April to May the following year. In spite of being such a small animal, the stoats gestation is among the longest reported for mammals (11 months) because of the delayed implantation.Female stoats produce 1 litter of 5 \u2013 12 young per year. The young are called \u2018kits\u2019. The young are weaned at 5 weeks and are fully independent and able to kill their own prey at 12 weeks. Male stoats will sometimes mate with young female kits in the nest, so that they are pregnant before they even leave their mothers. The average life span of a stoat is 1 \u2013 1.5 years, however, they can live up to 7 years of age.\u00a0Stoat Conservation StatusStoats are relatively common and are therefore not classed as endangered.

They regularly scavenge carrion and the remains of another animals kill. They use their powerful jaws to gnaw and crush bones.Hyenas are capable of digesting parts of prey other animals cannot. Parts such as hooves, horns, hair and ligaments are regurgitated into pellets. They often cache their food such as bones, pieces of flesh, or meat, in shallow holes dug with their snouts. They will also carry any surplus meat found at a scavenger site.Striped Hyenas can drink various types of water such as salt water, fresh water and soda. Water is consumed every night if it is available, however, the Striped Hyena can survive for long periods of time without water as it is adapted to live in desert conditions. Striped Hyenas forage alone or in pairs.",
            "behaviour": "Striped Hyenas are nomadic and will move from water hole to water hole, however, they never move more than 6 miles from a water source. They are solitary hunters but sometimes gather into small family groups, called \u2018clans\u2019 to scavenge carrion (dead animal carcasses). They have smaller home ranges than the Spotted or Brown Hyena.Striped Hyenas mark the territories with their scent gland secretions from their anal pouch. Like Brown Hyenas, Striped Hyenas are thought to be less vocal then their spotted cousins although they all have elaborate greeting rituals.",
            "reproduction": "There is no specific breeding season for the Striped Hyena. After a gestation period of 90 \u2013 92 days a litter of 2 \u2013 4 helpless cubs are born in nesting dens. Hyena cubs are born blind and their ear canals are closed. Their coats are white to grey with clear black stripes. After 7 \u2013 8 days, the cubs are able to open their eyes and their teeth develop after 3 weeks.Cubs can eat solid food after a month, however, weaning can vary from 8 weeks to 12 months while learning foraging skills from their mother. Both male and female provide parental care. Female Striped Hyenas have 6 teats whereas the Brown Hyena only has 4. The life span of the Striped Hyena is 24 years in captivity.",
            "conservation status": "The Striped Hyena is classed as \u2018Near Threatened\u2019 by the IUCN. Although it is extinct in Europe, it can, on rare occasions be observed in Anatolia, Turkey. It is often hunted or poisoned throughout its range, and although it has a fairly large population, it is scattered over a wide area and often isolated from other populations. Habitat destruction may also be a major concern."

Around 75 may live on Peninsular Malaysia. The main threats against this subspecies are habitat loss and illegal poaching.The Eastern Sumatran Rhinoceros or Bornean Rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis harrissoni), were once common throughout Borneo, now only about 25 individuals are estimated to survive. The known population on Borneo lives in Sabah. There are unconfirmed reports of animals surviving in Sarawak and Kalimantan. This subspecies is named after Tom Harrisson, who worked extensively with Bornean zoology and anthropology in the 1960s. The Bornean species is markedly smaller than the other two.The Northern Sumatran Rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis lasiotis), once roamed in India and Bangladesh, however, it has been declared extinct in these countries. Unconfirmed reports suggest that there may be a small population still surviving in Burma, but the political situation in the country has prevented verification. The name \u2018lasiotis\u2019 is derived from the Greek for \u2018hairy-ears\u2019. Later studies showed that their ear-hair was not longer than other Sumatran Rhinos, but D.s. lasiotis remained a subspecies because it was significantly larger than the other subspecies.Sumatran Rhinoceros Conservation StatusThe Sumatran Rhino is critically endangered due to destruction of its rainforest habitat. Known populations of this rhino are small and widely scattered, its forest habitat is dwindling fast and the threat of poaching is ever-present. Today, the world population of the Sumatran rhino may be below 300 individuals in the wild and so far captive breeding attempts have been unsuccessful.If the Sumatran Rhino is to survive much longer, urgent measures are needed to save the forests where it still occurs. Like all rhino, the Sumatran rhino is extremely low in population and although they live in protected areas, illegal horn poaching still occurs and threatens this rare species more each day. Most remaining habitat is in inaccessible mountainous areas of Indonesia, where the government has shown no inclination to discourage clearing of rhino habitat for the benefit of the timber industry.The Sumatran Rhinoceros is the last surviving species in the same group as the extinct woolly rhinoceros.\u00a0"

Tapirs spend most of their day underwater, using their snouts like snorkels, to keep cool in their hot forest environment and also to avoid predators.Tapirs are surprisingly agile swimmers given their size. Tapirs are also able to sink to the riverbed and walk along the bottom, just like rhinos can. When submerged, they allow small fish to pick parasites of their bodies. Tapirs will also wallow in mud during the day which helps them keep cool and eliminates insects from their skin.Tapirs are agile climbers, clambering up steep hillsides and river banks with apparent ease. During the night, tapirs emerge into more open country where they browse on vegetation and will follow one of several well-trodden trails to a favourite watering hole.Tapirs are solitary animals who spend most of their time alone except for females and their young. Because of their solitary lifestyles, tapirs can become aggressive towards each other on chance meetings. In order to avoid these chance meetings, tapirs mark their grounds with urine and alert each other of their presence by making loud vocalizations including high-pitched squeaks, shrills and whistles.Tapirs have very few natural predators because they are large animals and the thick skin on their necks makes it more difficult for a predator to grasp the animal. Most threats come from large cats such as Jaguars and Tigers, also snakes such as the Anaconda and Crocodiles when in water. Tapirs can also run rather quickly despite their size and are able to quickly find safety in the thick undergrowths of the forests or in water. When faced with a predator, a Tapir is able to defend itself using its strong jaws and sharp teeth.\u00a0",

            "reproduction": "Tapirs mate all year round but mostly during the rainy season. Young are born just before the rains begin in the following year. Mating can take place either in or out of the water. Breeding pairs will mate several times while the female is in estrous.

Young tapirs such as the Brazilian Tapir often have reddish/brown coats that are striped and flecked with white. This pattern provides them with camouflage in the dappled forest shade.Their hair will turn black as they develop, usually around 4 \u2013 7 months. The young tapirs are weaned between 6 \u2013 8 months at which time they are nearly fully grown. Tapirs reach sexual maturity at between 3 \u2013 4 years old with females reaching maturity earlier than males. The life span of a tapir is up to 35 years in the wild.\u00a0Tapir ConservationTapirs have considerably reduced in numbers due to hunting for their meat and hide. Habitat loss is also a major threat to the tapir. The Brazilian Tapir and the Malayan Tapir are now classed as \u2018Vulnerable\u2019.The Baird\u2019s Tapir and the Mountain Tapir are both classed as \u2018Endangered Species\u2019 with the Mountain Tapir being the most threatened species. There are a number of conservation efforts in progress.The Tapir Specialist Group are currently striving to help the Tapir with its survival with programs to save, restore and manage the four species of tapir.\u00a0"

            "habitat": "The Tawny Eagle prefers open dry habitats such as deserts, steppes, open grasslands, savannas and mountainous regions. They tend to avoid dense forests as these may restrict their movement.",
            "diet": "Like most Eagles, the Tawny Eagles are generalist carnivores and formidable hunters. Their diet relies mainly on fresh carrion of animals that have recently been killed. They also eat insects and kill small animals such as smaller birds, rabbits and small reptiles including lizards and snakes. It will even tackle mammals as large as Hares. The Eagle will make a rapid dive from its perch when the prey is spotted, and seize it in its sharp, powerful talons.As an opportunistic scavenger, the Tawny Eagle will also steal prey from other raptors. Birds who do this are known as \u2018kleptoparasites\u2019. These magnificent birds of prey can be observed alongside other large raptors, such as Vultures, ripping into carcasses.Tawny Eagles are the only type of eagle that regularly scavenge from humans.Tawny Eagles do spend time near water where they can drink safely.",
            "behaviour": "Tawny Eagles, like other Eagle species, are diurnal \u2013 active by day, sleeping at night. Tawny Eagles tend to occupy the same territory for many years, sometimes even decades, in pairs.The Tawny Eagle is generally a silent bird but males will emit a crow-like barking or \u2018kwok kwok\u2019 noise when displaying to a female or when aggravated. Tawny Eagles are gregarious outside of the breeding season and flocks of 20 or more birds are commonly observed.Tawny Eagles are strong fliers and can fly at elevations of 600 \u2013 2400 metres (1,968 \u2013 14,760 feet). They particularly fly only when air thermals can assist their soaring and usually perch on a tree or telegraph pole during the day scanning the ground for food.When Tawny Eagles reach adult size, they probably do not have many predators, if any at all. Tawny Eagles are important members of the ecosystems in which they live.Tawny Eagles are monogamous and pair for life. Before mating occurs, the male Eagle performs undulating displays and then mutual soaring displays take place in the air. The pairs or the single male will perform high circling flying over the nesting site. Sometimes, the male performs \u2018pot hooks\u2019 which involves dives and swoops with little wing flapping. The female may turn over and present her claws in response to the male swooping over her. Males and females may lock claws in flight. Actual mating usually occurs at or near the nesting site.",
            "reproduction": "Tawny Eagles breed once a year. Breeding season falls from April to July.The female Eagle lays 1 \u2013 3 eggs in a nest made from sticks and twigs which is made in trees or on the ground. Both male and female make the nests together. Nests are generally abandoned after 1 \u2013 3 years. The eggs hatch after being incubated by the female for 39 \u2013 45 days. Incubation is occasionally done by the male.Chicks become fledglings at around 84 days and become independant at around 120 days although some will remain with their parents until the following breeding season. The chicks are fed mainly by the male and then by both parents when the young become fledglings.Siblings can be aggressive towards each other, sometimes resulting in the death of the younger hatchling. The conflicts occur during the first few days of hatching.Young Tawny Eagles have a less contrasting appearance than the adults. They are paler, sometimes white, and more streaked than the adults.

            "behaviour": "The tawny frogmouth is not a raptor despite its owl-like appearance and unlike owls, it catches its prey in its beak instead of its talons. Another way that frogmouths differ from owls is that, owls fly around at night, hunting for prey, while the frogmouth will just sit there on a low branch and wait for food to come to them. When it does hunt, it usually pounces from a low, elevated perch such as a fence post or road sign, onto small terrestrial animals crossing bare, open ground.They tend to live in pairs that maintain permanent territory which extends 40 \u2013 80 hectares (0.4 \u2013 0.8 square kilometres).Tawny Frogmouths are vocal birds and produce loud clacking sounds with their beaks and a soft, deep, continuous, \u2018ooo-ooo-ooo\u2019 sound. They can be heard emitting a soft warning buzz, similar to a bee, when startled. These owl-like creatures are nocturnal and hunt during the night, spending the day roosting on a tree branch close to the tree trunk or a dead log.When Tawny frogmouths feel threatened, they remain perfectly motionless. They close their eyes and point their beak straight and rely on their remarkable camouflage for protection.\u00a0",
            "reproduction": "Tawny Frogmouths are monogamous and pairs will remain together until one of them dies. Breeding season is from August to December. The same nesting site is used each year, therefore, nest repairs have to be made to loose sticks, twigs and untidy platforms and new leaves are used to line the inside. Sometimes the nest with be lined with their own feathers which are camouflaged with lichen, moss and spider webs. Nests are generally 15 metres off the ground.The female lays 2 \u2013 3 eggs in the nest and both male and female take turns to incubate them, the female at night and the male during th day. After the eggs have been incubated for around 30 days, the frogmouth chicks hatch out and are covered in downy feathers.

These fish are easily recognized with their interesting and protruding teeth, similar to those of a wolf, from which it gets its common name. However, the similarities between the animals stop there! These teeth are very strong and allow the Atlantic wolffish to crush the hard shell of mollusks and crustaceans almost instantly. The Atlantic wolffish population is rapidly being depleted in US waters, which is most likely down to overfishing. They are listed as a Species of Concern according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s National Marine Fisheries Service, however are Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List.",

With their special teeth, they are well-designed to eat these type of animals and can crush them while chewing. They also eat large hermit crabs, sea clams, cockles, large whelks, sea urchins, and green crabs, and starfish. They do not eat any other type of fish.Atlantic wolffish are an important predator of sea urchins and green crabs, whose populations escalate rapidly and can negatively affect the health of a marine system",
            "atlantic wolffish behavior": "Wolffish are primarily stationary fish and rarely move from their rocky homes. They do not like to travel far, but will take short journeys to search for food.",
            "atlantic wolffish reproduction": "Atlantic wolffish form breeding pairs in spring to summer and mate in the fall. Their method of fertilizing their eggs is much different from most fish species, as females do not deposit eggs in the open ocean for the male to fertilize. Instead, the eggs are fertilized inside the female. One female can produce anywhere from 5,000 to 12,000 eggs in her lifetime! The size of the fish affects the number of eggs, with larger females laying more.Both the males and females help to protect the eggs once they have been laid on the ocean floor. The eggs are the largest of any fish, with sizes of 5.5 to 6mm diameters. They have an opaque, yellowish tint and clump together. The eggs hatch after anywhere between three and nine months, depending on the water temperature.During the larvae stage, they stay at the bottom of the ocean close to the hatch site. It can take a few hours to one week before the larvae are ready to venture into the water column, where they\u2019re pelagic for two weeks to two months.Atlantic wolffish do not reach sexual maturity until quite late, at around eight to ten years old.\u00a0Atlantic Wolffish Location and HabitatAs their name suggests, Atlantic wolffish are found in the North Atlantic Ocean. They inhabit both the west and east coasts of the Atlantic. In the west Atlantic, they are present as far north as the Davis Strait, of the Canadian territory of Nunavut, populating the shores of Greenland, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia, extending as far south as Cape Cod. The most dense populations are in Georges Bank, the Gulf of Maine and the Great South Channel. In the east Atlantic, they range from Russia\u2019s White Sea and Novaya Zemlya, through the Nordic countries and British Isles, to the Bay of Biscay.This wolffish species are benthic dwellers, living on the hard ocean floor, frequently seen in nooks and small caves. They prefer cold water, in water temperatures of \u22121 to 11 \u00b0C (30 to 52 \u00b0F), and therefore live at depths of 20 to 500 m (66 to 1,640 ft).The wolffish contains a natural antifreeze to keep their blood moving smoothly even in near-freezing waters.Atlantic Wolffish Conservation StatusThe exact population of the Atlantic wolffish is unknown, but it is thought the number is declining. They were listed as a Species of Concern by the U.S. Marine Fisheries Service in 2004. However, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has not yet moved this species to an Endangered status.Atlantic wolffish are often caught unintentionally by fisherman in their fishing nets. They are also at risk of otter trawling, where large nets are dragged along the ocean floor, which can cause significant damage to the wolffish\u2019s rocky habitat and catch them in the nets during the process.The slow sexual maturity rate of Atlantic wolffish can put the species population at severe risk from humans. If wolffish are captured for commercial fishing before they reach the age of sexual maturity, the amount of these fish in our seas is going to decline rapidly.Climate change and global warming is another risk to Atlantic wolffish. These animals thrive in very cold waters, and the increasing temperature of the seas can not only affect the wolffish but also their habitat and prey.",
            "atlantic wolffish predators": "Atlantic wolffish do not have many natural predators in their environments. The only predator that would attack them is the Atlantic cod. However, young wolffish are at risk of being eaten by Atlantic cod, Greenland sharks, gray seals, haddock, and some spotted wolffish.Humans are much more of a threat to Atlantic wolffish than other animals are. While fishing for Atlantic wolffish is illegal, they are often caught accidentally by fishermen.\u00a0"

It has two subspecies \u2014 the nominate species and H. l. washingtoniensis. Despite their name, bald eagles are not actually bald, but have feathers that are mainly brown with a white head and tail. The common name bald eagle derives from an older meaning of the word, \u201cwhite headed\u201d. The bald eagle is the national symbol of the United States. In the late 20th century, these eagles were almost extinct, but populations have since recovered. It is now listed as Least Concern by the IUCN Red List.",
            "bald eagle lifespan": "The bald eagle has a lifespan of anywhere between 15 and 30 years. However, they can live for even longer in captivity. Bald eagle eggs and juvenile bald eagles do not have a very high survival rate, but adult birds tend to have a 90% annual survival rate.",
            "bald eagle diet": "Bald eagles are opportunistic carnivores and therefore eat a wide variety of prey. The species mainly target prey which is much smaller than themselves, with most live fish caught weighing 1 to 3 kg (2.2 to 6.6 lb) and most waterbirds preyed weighing 0.2 to 2.7 kg (0.44 to 5.95 lb).In the winter, bald eagles often eat small mammals and carrion, such as ground squirrels, rabbits, hares, raccoons, beavers, montane voles, Norway rats, sea otter pups, elk, moose, deer fawn, armadillos, skunk, caribou, bison, wolves and arctic foxes.When hunting by a river for fish, the speed of a river flow can greatly impact their hunting success. These birds do not submerge themselves to obtain prey, but instead use their strong talons to remove fish near the water surface. When hunting ground animals, perch and observe before descending on their prey and lifting it from the ground with their talons. They are also known to pirate prey from other raptor species, such as ospreys.Bald eagles do not forage for food when there are humans around. In case of food scarcity, bald eagles often gorge and store food in their crop for later digestion. They can also survive for several days without food.",
            "bald eagle behavior": "Bald eagles are generally solitary birds, but may be seen in large groups of up to 400 individuals in areas where there is an abundance of food. Pairs of bald eagles also bond during the nesting season.These North American birds spend most of their time resting \u2014 up to 91% of their day is spent resting! \u2014 and the rest of the time is spent hunting for food. They are usually less active in the winter or when there are strong winds or rain that could interfere with their hunting.These eagles have very strong wings and are therefore very powerful fliers. They can reach speeds of 56 to 70 km/h (35 to 43 mph) when gliding and flapping, and about 48 km/h (30 mph) while carrying fish. They tend to soar using slow, heavy wing beats, which allow them to travel far distances. They can walk, too, but they are slightly awkward about it! They tend to rock their bodies as they move.Southern birds are resident and remain on breeding territory all year round. However, northern birds are migratory, particularly if the open water within their range freezes during the winter, making it impossible to obtain food. They will then migrate to the south or to the coast. Migration generally takes place during the daytime, usually between the local hours of 8:00 am and 6:00 pm, when thermals are produced by the sun. Birds return to their nesting sites at varying times, as soon as weather allows.Contrary to popular belief, bald eagles have relatively weak, high pitched, thin vocalizations, composed of chirps, whistles and harsh chatters. They tend to communicate more with wing displays rather than with vocalizations.",
            "bald eagle reproduction": "Bald eagles are monogamous and are believed to mate for life. They do not migrate with their mate, but perform displays when they come together for the breeding season. The breeding season takes place in and around March depending on the season, which is early compared to most raptors that mate in April or May.The bald eagle begins to build its nest in either January or February. When they are old enough to breed, they often return to the area where they were born. Bald eagle nests are composed of sticks and are the largest of any bird in North America. The nest is used repeatedly over many years and with new material added each year may eventually be as large as 4 m (13 ft) deep, 2.5 m (8.2 ft) across and weigh as much as 1 metric ton. Nests are usually built in large trees near water, but may occasionally be built on the ground if there are no trees.These eagles typically produce 1 brood of 1 to 3 eggs per season and are generally incubated for about 35 days. Incubation takes place from mid-March to early May. The eggs are round to oval and are generally whitish and range from 58 to 85 mm (2.3 to 3.3 in) long and 47 to 63 mm (1.9 to 2.5 in) wide.Both the male and female take turns incubating the eggs, but the female does most of the sitting. The parent not incubating will hunt for food or look for nesting material during this stage. During the nestling period, young are fed 4 to 5 times per day. For the first two to three weeks of the nestling period, at least one adult is at the nest almost 100% of the time. However, after five to six weeks, parents may leave and perch in a tree nearby.Bald eagles are the largest semi-altricial birds in North America and weigh approximately 60 grams at hatching and may gain up to 180 grams per day. Immediately after hatching, bald eagles have dark eyes, with pink legs and skin and flesh colored talons, although their skin darkens to a bluish hue and their legs become yellow within the first 18 to 22 days of their life. Throughout their first year, they have dark brown bodies, eyes and beaks.The baby bald eagles leave the nest when they are between 8 and 14 weeks old, although they may remain dependent until they are 18 weeks old. Before leaving the nest, the young eaglets pick up and manipulate sticks, play tug of war with each other, practice holding things in their talons, and stretch and flap their wings. Bald eagles reach sexual maturity at around 5 years old.By the time they are two years old, the bald eagles\u2019s eyes lighten, becoming grayish-brown, they develop a light colored superciliary line and their body becomes mottled white. During their 3rd year, their bills and eyes begin to turn yellow and the coloration of their head feathers lighten, although their body remains mottled. In their 4th year, their body becomes mostly dark and their head and tail become mostly white, with some beige around their eyes and crown and isolated dark spots on their tail. By the time they are five years old, they will have developed their adult plumage.\u00a0Bald Eagle Location and HabitatBald eagles are found throughout North America. They are native to Canada, the United States, portions of Mexico and several islands including Saint Pierre and Miquelon, but some of the mot densely populated areas are Florida, Alaska, the Pacific Northwest and near some rivers and lakes in the Midwest.They are mostly found near large water sources, such as sea coasts, coastal estuaries and inland lakes and rivers, usually no more than 3 km from one of these areas. Their habitats can vary, but are mostly decided on based on prey availability. They will perch, nest and roost in tall, coniferous trees or hardwood trees, surrounded by smaller trees. The trees must have good visibility, be over 20 m (66 ft) tall, have an open structure, and be in close proximity to prey.The bald eagle may also nest on the ground, on cliffs, on cellular phone towers, on electrical poles and in artificial nesting towers. They generally try to avoid areas where there will be a lot of human disturbance.Bald Eagle Conservation StatusBald eagles are currently listed as a species of least concern according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species due to their increasing population and large range. However, this wasn\u2019t always the case.The bald eagle population was negatively affected throughout the 1900s by hunting, habitat destruction and the use of pesticides and insecticides, such as DDT. The Bald Eagle Protection Act was put into effect in 1940, but their populations still continued to decline. Fortunately, after the ban of DDT in 1972, their population has increased dramatically, but they were still listed on the Endangered Species Act in 1978.Their population has continued to grow since the ban in 1972, and the bald eagle was officially removed from the U.S. federal government\u2019s endangered species list on July 12, 1995.Bald eagles can be kept in captivity in the United States, but a permit is required to do so.",
            "bald eagle predators": "Adult bald eagles have very few predators, which allows them to nest on the ground without much worry. Most non-human-related mortality involves nestlings or eggs. The eggs and young are often preyed upon by magpies, gulls, ravens, crows, black bears, raccoon, bobcats, wolverines and arctic foxes. A study found that immature bald eagles have a survival rate of 89% in rural habitats and 65 to 72% in suburban habitats.\u00a0Bald Eagle FAQsWhere does a bald eagle live?Bald eagles are found across North America, particularly in areas close to large bodies of water, such as estuaries, large lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and some seacoasts. Some of these birds migrate to warmer areas during the winter when water sources near to them freeze over.They usually nest, rest and perch in tall trees where they have good views of the area around them for spotting prey.How big is a bald eagle?A bald eagle is a very big bird with a body length of between 70 to 102 cm (28 to 40 in) and a wingspan between 1.8 and 2.3 m (5 ft 11 in and 7 ft 7 in)! Males are usually larger than females.How much does a bald eagle weigh?Bald eagles weigh between 3 and 6.3 kg (6.6 and 13.9 lb)! This allows them to hunt very large prey, including fish that can weigh up to 3kg!How tall is a bald eagle?Adult males are around 90 cm (36 inches) long and have a wingspan of 2 metres (6.6 feet). Females, which grow somewhat larger than males, may reach 108 cm (43 inches) in length and have a wingspan of 2.5 metres (8 feet).What does a bald eagle eat?Bald eagles are opportunistic feeders. They are carnivores and have a huge range in their diet, with more than 400 species of animal included in their diet! Their diet mostly consists of fish, but they\u2019ll also eat waterfowl and small mammals. They use their very strong talons to pick up their food and pierce vital organs, killing the prey before they eat it. These birds also pirate prey off other birds sometimes!How long does a bald eagle live for?A bald eagle usually lives for between 15 and 30 years in the wild, but may live even longer in captivity.\u00a0"

            "desc": "The burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) is one of the smallest owl species. Also known as the shoco, they are found in both North and South America, primarily in grasslands, deserts, and other open habitats. These owls are long-legged, sandy coloured, and have bright-yellow eyes. Unlike other owls, the burrowing owl is very active during the day and nests in underground burrows. The burrowing owl population is not considered to be vulnerable or endangered, and they are listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.\u00a0 Burrowing owls measure between 19 to 25 cm tall and weigh roughly between 127 to 255 grams. They usually have a wingspan of between 53 to 61 cm. Compared to the rest of their body, their tail is short, but their legs are long, which allow them to sprint fast on foot."

            "desc": "The harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja), also known as the American harpy eagle or Brazilian harpy eagle, is a neotropical species of eagle, distributed throughout Central to South America. It is one of the largest extant species of eagle in the world, and the largest and most powerful in its range, weighing between 4 to 9 kg (8.8 to 20 lb). The harpy eagle belongs to the Accipitridae and subfamily Harpiinae, and the genus Harpia. It is the only member of its genus and is most closely related to the crested eagle (Morphnus guianensis) and the New Guinea harpy eagle (Harpyopsis novaeguineae). Along with the genus Harpia, the genus\u2019 Harpyopsis and Morphnus form the subfamily Harpiinae. The name harpyja and the word \u201charpy\u201d in the common name harpy eagle both come from Ancient Greek harpyia (\u1f05\u03c1\u03c0\u03c5\u03b9\u03b1). These birds are usually found in the tropical lowland rainforests in mid to upper levels of rainforest canopies, where they are able to find their prey \u2014 sloths and primates. They also eat lizards, birds and small rodents.",
            "harpy eagle lifespan": "A healthy harpy eagle has an average lifespan of between 25 to 35 years. However, if a harpy eagle becomes sick or injured, their chances of survival are dramatically reduced due to the inability to hunt and capture prey.",
            "harpy eagle diet": "Harpy eagles are carnivores at the top of the food chain, with their main prey being tree-dwelling mammals found in the top canopy where they reside, such as sloths and monkeys. The most common species of monkeys taken by harpy eagles are capuchin monkeys, saki monkeys, howler monkeys, titi monkeys, squirrel monkeys, and spider monkeys.Other prey taken by harpy eagles include land mammals like porcupines, squirrels, opossums, anteaters and armadillos, and reptiles such as iguanas, tegus, and snakes. They may also prey on bird species such as macaws and parrots.Harpy eagles have been known to take domestic livestock, including chickens, lambs, goats, and young pigs. For this reason, these birds are often killed by farmers when seen on their land, which has led to a decline in their population. Despite the view that harpy eagles pose a large threat to livestock, the chances of these animals being taken by the eagle is actually fairly small.The harpy eagle is extremely strong, and its talons allow it to take prey equal to its own body weight. Males usually take relatively smaller prey, with a typical range of 0.5 to 2.5 kg (1.1 to 5.5 lb) or about half their own weight, while females take larger prey, around 2.7 kg (6.0 lb).",
            "harpy eagle hunting habits": "Harpy eagles usually use perch hunting, in which they scan for prey activity while briefly perched between short flights from tree to tree. Once they have spotted their prey, they can attack it from either above or below, preferring to strike quickly before the victim is aware of their presence.They may also \u201csit-and-wait\u201d, meaning they perch for long periods on a high point near an opening, a river, or a salt lick. They have also been observed tail-chasing; pursuing another bird in flight, rapidly dodging trees and branches.They grab their prey by using their long talons and powerful legs. They are also powerful enough to carry their prey away to a perch to feed. If the prey is too heavy to carry, then the eagle will partially eat it before returning to the nest.",
            "behavior": "The harpy eagle is a generally solitary animal that prefers to hunt alone or with a breeding partner. They use their excellent eyesight that allows them to see prey less than an inch large from about 650 feet away, and their ability to carefully maneuver through dense forests with their wings to catch their prey. They also use their good sense of hearing, which makes up for their relatively poor sense of smell.These birds of prey are diurnal and hunt during the day. Harpy eagles can travel at speeds of up to 50 mph for short periods of time, although they cannot sustain this speed for very long. They use their long tail feathers to help them navigate.Harpy eagles are largely silent when away from the nest. At the nest, adults can call out a weak, melancholy scream. Males call out as they approach the nest with food, although vocalizations in both parents decreases as the nestlings age, while the nestlings become more vocal. The nestlings call \u201cchi-chi-chi\u201d which is usually in response to rain or direct sunlight.",
            "harpy eagle reproduction": "Harpy eagles are a monogamous species that appear to form lifelong bonds with their chosen mates. They share the duties of raising young, including building a nest. Pairs of harpy eagles will often rub their bills together, which is believed to be part of mate bonding.Harpy eagles build nests 90 to 140 feet above the ground primarily in kapok or silk-cotton trees where the young chicks are safe from almost all potential predators except for other birds. The nests consist of sticks, vegetation, and animal fur and are about five feet in diameter. They usually use the same nesting site each year.A pair of these eagles usually only raises one chick every 2 to 3 years. The mating season begins with the rainy season around April or May, during which time the pair will mate several times over the course of a few days. After mating, the female will typically lay two eggs at a time, but raise only a single chick. If two chicks hatch, then the parents will usually leave the second one to starve. If the first chick dies, however, then there is a good chance the second egg will survive.The egg is incubated for around 56 days, during which time the female takes on most of the incubation duties and the male searches for food. After the chick has hatched, both parents take care of it, protecting it and bringing it food. Prey that is brought to the nest is normally medium-sized, between 1 to 4 kg (2.2 to 8.8 lb). Males tend to bring smaller prey than females.Harpy eagle chicks can stand and walk at around 35 days. They will remain all-white for the first six to seven months of age, after which it will gain its adult feathers. The chick also fledges at the age of 6 months, but the parents continue to feed it for another 6 to 10 months.Harpy eagles reach sexual maturity at around 4 to 6 years of age.\u00a0Location and HabitatThe harpy eagle is found throughout Central and South America, from southern Mexico to the eastern part of Bolivia, southern Brazil, and northern Argentina. Harpy eagles are almost extinct in Central America due to habitat loss, and are most common in Brazil.They mostly reside in the mid to upper levels of canopies of tropical lowland rainforests, where they are able to catch their prey such as primates and sloths. Harpy eagles generally prefer undisturbed forests but will also hunt along open patches of land.Harpy Eagle Conservation StatusThe harpy eagle is considered to be Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The exact population of these birds is unknown, but there is thought to be less than 50,000 individuals remaining in the wild. They are already almost extinct in much of Mexico and Central America.The population of the eagle declined as a result of forest fragmentation, shooting, and nest destruction, resulting in near extirpation of the species. The destruction of the Amazon rainforest plays the biggest part in the decline in this eagle, and experts worry that at some point the loss of the Amazon may become irreversible. On top of that, these birds only reproduce every 2 to 3 years, and thus the population may never fully recover.There have also been reports of harpy eagles being shot by farmers who perceive the eagles as livestock predators.Despite this, there are efforts underway to help protect the harpy eagle. Conservation organizations such as the Peregrine Fund are trying to prevent the further loss of population numbers and reintroduce the species into its former habitat. The Peregrine Fund is also using a captive-breeding and release project to help restore numbers in the wild.A research project is occurring in Brazil, at the National Institute of Amazonian Research, through which 62 known nesting locations are being monitored by researchers and volunteers from local communities.In Belize, the Belize Harpy Eagle Restoration Project began in 2003 and captive-bred harpy eagles were released in the Rio Bravo Conservation and Management Area in Belize, chosen for its quality forest habitat and linkages with Guatemala and Mexico.Local governments are also working to preserve the remaining rainforest habitat for these animals. What\u2019s more, programs are being set up to educate farmers and hunters to increase awareness and understanding of these eagles.",
            "predators": "Harpy eagles are apex predators, meaning adults do not really have any predators of their own. Hatchling harpy eagles may be at risk from predation by other harpy eagles, but this type of predation is a rare occasion as the parents defend the nest and their territory.",
            "importance": "Harpy eagles are apex predators of their rainforest ecosystems, helping to keep populations of other animals in their ecosystem regulated.They are the national bird of Panama and Parana, Brazil, and are occasionally used in ceremonial rituals by indigenous hunters.The bird appeared on the reverse side of the Venezuelan 2,000 bol\u00edvares fuertes note. They were also the inspiration behind the design of Fawkes the Phoenix in the Harry Potter film series.\u00a0Harpy Eagle FAQsHow big is a harpy eagle?The harpy eagle is the largest and most powerful raptor found throughout its range, and one of the largest eagles in the world. Females are generally larger than males, and can weigh between 6 to 9 kg (13 to 20 lb), while males may weigh 4 to 6 kg (8.8 to 13.2 lb).Their total length may measure from 86.5 to 107 cm (2 ft 10 in to 3 ft 6 in)!These birds are so big and strong that they can carry prey the same weight as their body, while flying!How big is the Harpy Eagle Wingspan?The Harpy Eagle is one of the largest flying birds in the world with a wingspan of 176 to 224 cm (5 ft 9 in to 7 ft 4 in).Where do harpy eagles live?They live in Central and South America. They can be found in tropical lowland rainforests in the mid to upper levels of rain forest canopies. This is because their prey is found in these areas.How fast do harpy eagles fly?Harpy eagles can fly fast \u2014 at speeds of up to 50 mph. However, they can only maintain this speed for short periods of time.What do harpy eagles eat?The main foods this eagle likes to eat are monkeys and sloths. However, they will also eat reptiles, land mammals, and other birds. They have also been known to eat livestock, although this is quite rare.\u00a0"

            "desc": "The leopard (Panthera pardus) is one of the five extant species in the genus Panthera, a member of the cat family, Felidae. Other members of the genus are the lion, the jaguar, the snow leopard and the tiger. Leopards are characterized by their striking fur of dark spots grouped in rosettes, that allow them to camouflage against their habitat. These big cats are also known for their strength, opportunistic hunting behavior and the ability to run very fast, at speeds of up to 58 km/h (36 mph). The leopard is found across sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. There are nine different sub-species of Leopard which differ in their appearance and geographic location, with the African Leopard being the most common and widespread. The others are the rare Amur Leopard, Sri Lankan Leopard, Javan Leopard, Indochinese Leopard, North-Chinese Leopard, Persian Leopard, Arabian Leopard and Indian Leopard.",
            "lifespan": "Leopards have a lifespan of between 10 and 12 years in the wild. In captivity, they have been known to live for up to 27 years.Leopard cubs have a survival rate of only 41% to 50%. Lions, tigers, spotted hyenas and African wild dogs prey upon leopard cubs.",
            "diet": "Leopards are carnivores and favor prey that is medium in size, with a body mass ranging from 10 to 40 kg (22 to 88 lb). It is thought males eat 3.5 kg (7 lb 11 oz) of prey daily, while females eat 2.8 kg (6 lb 3 oz). They have been recorded to eat over 100 species of animal, but the most common are ugulates, including small antelopes, gazelles, deer, pigs, primates and domestic livestock. However, they are opportunistic carnivores and will also eat birds, reptiles, rodents, arthropods, and carrion when available.Leopards will scavenge food off cheetahs, solitary hyenas and other small carnivores, too, but will also eat much smaller prey to avoid intense competition for food from other large carnivores like tigers and hyenas, with which they share parts of their natural range.These animals are very strong and have the ability to take prey that is much larger than themselves. They prey primarily at night and use their excellent vision and hearing to track down prey. The leopard will stalk its prey and tries to approach as closely as possible, typically within 5 m (16 ft), and, finally, will pounce on it and kill it by suffocation. It kills small prey with a bite to the back of the neck, but holds larger animals by the throat and strangles them.They usually hunt on the ground, but have been observed to ambush prey by jumping down on it from trees.Because leopards are so strong, they can drag their prey to safety, and will even drag carcasses heavier than themselves up into trees. It eats small prey immediately but will drag larger prey to trees, caves or bushes.In very hot areas, leopards meet their water requirements by the bodily fluids of prey and succulent plants. These animals drink water every two to three days and feed infrequently on moisture-rich plants such as gemsbok cucumbers, watermelon and Kalahari sour grass.",
            "behavior": "Leopards are solitary animals that only really associate in the mating season. Female leopards will interact with their offspring even after weaning, and have been observed sharing kills with their offspring when they can not obtain any prey, but it is uncommon to see other leopards interacting. Males interact with their partners and cubs at times. Most leopards tend to keep 1 km (0.62 mi) apart.They are territorial animals within the species, and they mark their territory with urine, feces, and claw marks. However, they often share their home range with many other animals, including big cats. Leopards will often hunt at different times to other big cats within the area, and will take smaller prey to avoid confrontation with these animals.Leopards are mainly active from dusk till dawn, although in some areas are nocturnal, and rest for most of the day. They usually rest in thickets, among rocks or over tree branches. Over the course of one night, they can travel has far as 75 km (47 mi). They can run at over 58 km/h (36 mph), leap over 6 m (20 ft) horizontally, and jump up to 3 m (9.8 ft) vertically. This means they can climb trees very well. They are also comfortable in water and are adequate swimmers.The leopard produces a number of vocalizations, including growls, snarls, meows and purrs. Cubs call their mother with a urr-urr sound. The whiteish spots on the back of leopards ears are thought to play a role in communication, too, although it is unsure what exactly for.",
            "leopard reproduction": "Leopards have no distinctive breeding season and females are able to reproduce every couple of months. Breeding usually peaks during the rainy season in May. In China and southern Siberia, leopards mainly breed in January and February.Females have a 46 day long cycle and are in estrus for 7 days. Both males and females have multiple mates throughout their lifetime, with females attract potential mates by excreting pheromones in their urine. Females initiate mating by walking back and forth in front of a male and brushing up against him or swatting him with her tail.The gestation period for leopards is 96 days, after which two to three cubs are born. Leopard cubs weigh less than 1 kg at birth, and their eyes remain closed for the first week. Mothers leave their cubs in the protection of dense bush, rock clefts, or hollow tree trunks for up to 36 hours while hunting and feeding.Mothers move their den sites frequently, which helps prevent the cubs from falling prey to lions and other predators. The cubs learn to walk at 2 weeks of age and regularly leave the den at 6 to 8 weeks old, around which time they begin to eat solid food. Juveniles have woolly fur, and appear to be dark-colored due to the densely arranged spots.The cubs are completely weaned by 3 months old and independent at just under 20 months old. Often, siblings maintain contact during the early years of independence.Males usually do not have much to do with their partners or cubs after copulation, however on occasion they have been observed interacting.Females usually give birth once every 15 to 24 months and stop reproducing around 8.5 years old. They reach sexual maturity at around 2.5 years old.\u00a0Leopard Location and HabitatLeopards are the widest ranging of all the big cats and are found throughout sub-Saharan Africa, in some parts of Western and Central Asia, Southern Russia, and on the Indian subcontinent to Southeast and East Asia. The different subspecies of leopard are found in different areas, with the African leopard (the most widespread of all the subspecies) being native to most of sub-Saharan Africa.Contemporary records suggest that the leopard occurs in only 25% of its historical global range. The leopard is considered locally extinct in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Jordan, Morocco, Togo, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Lebanon, Mauritania, Kuwait, Syria, Libya, Tunisia and most likely in North Korea, Gambia, Laos, Lesotho, Tajikistan, Vietnam and Israel.These animals inhabit woodlands, grassland savannas, rainforests and forests, as well as mountainous, scrub, and desert habitats. Leopards can be found in many different areas, as long as there is a good source of cover and an ample supply of food.Home range sizes vary depending on the habitat and the food available but those of male leopards are significantly larger than those of females. Female ranges often overlap the ranges of a number of both males and other females.Leopards have actually been known to both live and hunt in areas close to urban activity, and have adapted to this as human activity has increased. It is thought that this is one of the primary reasons that the species is not yet critically endangered.Leopards often inhabit the same areas as tigers, lions, cheetahs, spotted hyenas, striped hyenas, brown hyenas and wolves. Some of these animals steal the leopards kill and even kill leopard cubs. However, leopards retreat up a tree in the face of direct aggression and generally do not confront these animals.\u00a0Leopard Conservation StatusLeopards are declining in parts of their geographic range due to habitat loss and fragmentation, and hunting for trade (Big five game) and pest control. As a result, leopards are listed as \u201cVulnerable\u201d on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.Humans are the biggest threat to leopards. Leopards are often captured for the pet trade and are targeted by trophy hunters as well. With the global population of humans growing, more and more of the leopard\u2019s habitat is being lost. Despite this, leopards seem to be quite resilient to habitat disturbance and will tolerate the presence of humans.Leopards are protected throughout most of their range in west Asia. While habitat reserves and national parks exist throughout their geographic range in Africa, a majority of leopards live outside these protected areas. They are extinct in many countries in which they used to live, and, despite being one of the big cats, 5 of 9 subspecies are listed as endangered or critically endangered.Some leopards are kept in captivity. While they have longer lifespans and often breed well in captivity, it is extremely difficult to return a captive-bred big cat to the wild and this almost never happens.A 2014 survey indicated that there are around 12,000 to 14,000 leopards existing in the wild today.",
            "leopard predators": "Adult leopards are apex predators and therefore do not have many predators of their own. They are very well camouflaged in their environment thanks to their spots. Generally, the biggest natural threat to leopards are other leopards, although they have been known to be killed by occasional lions and tigers if they can get close enough. Typically, when an adult is killed, it is due to a territorial confrontation.Leopard young, however, are susceptible to being preyed on, and have a survival rate of only 41% to 50%. They can be taken by hyenas, lions, tigers, snakes, jackals and birds of prey. This usually happens when their mother is off hunting for food and they cannot defend themselves.Learn about other animals from Africa\u00a0"

        "The Numbat": {
            "image": "https://animalcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Numbat-340x200.png",
            "desc": "The numbat (Myrmecobius fasciatus), also known as the noombat or walpurti is a marsupial belonging to the Myrmecobiidae and the genus Myrmecobius. The numbat was once widespread across southern Australia, but is now restricted to several small colonies in Western Australia. This makes it an endangered animal, and it is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. The numbat first became known to Europeans in 1831. It was discovered by an exploration party who were exploring the Avon Valley under the leadership of Robert Dale. The numbat genus Myrmecobius is the sole member of the family Myrmecobiidae, one of four families that make up the order Dasyuromorphia, the Australian marsupial carnivores. Two subspecies of the numbat have been described, but one of these \u2014 the rusty colored Myrmecobius fasciatus rufus \u2014 has been extinct since at least the 1960s, and only the nominate subspecies (M. fasciatus fasciatus) remains alive today.",
            "lifespan": "The average lifespan for males or females in the wild is four to five years, as compared to seven years for a female and eleven years for a male in captivity. Their lifespan is generally short because they are preyed on by foxes, raptors, and cats.",
            "diet": "The numbat\u2019s diet consists primarily of termites and they eat approximately 15,000 to 20,000 termites per day. They use their elongated snout for getting into logs and small holes to locate the termites and use their long tongue to retrieve the termites. Other features the termites possess for preying include complex salivary glands and their razor-sharp claws that are used for digging into termite galleries in the soil.The digestive system of the numbat is relatively simple, and lacks many of the adaptations found in other entomophagous animals, presumably because termites are easier to digest than ants, having a softer exoskeleton.Although the numbat finds termite mounds primarily using scent, and has a very strong sense of smell, allowing the animal to find termite galleries are as far as 50 mm below the surface of the soil, it also has the highest visual acuity of any marsupial. This is likely an adaptation for its diurnal habits, and vision does appear to be the primary sense used to detect potential predators.",
            "numbat behavior": "The numbat is diurnal and the only marsupial that is fully active by day. They synchronize their day with termite activity, which is temperature dependent. In winter, the numbat feeds from mid-morning to mid-afternoon, but in summer, they rise earlier, and take shelter during the heat of the day and feed again in the late afternoon.Adult numbats are typically solitary and territorial. They establish a territory of up to 1.5 square kilometers (370 acres) early on in life and defend it from others of the same sex, and generally remain in that territory for the rest of their lives. Male and female territories occasionally overlap, and males will venture out of their territory for breeding.Numbats sleep in nests at night, usually hollow logs, trees, or burrows, which are around 1-2 meters long. They line these with soft plant material such as grass, leaves and flowers, and will block the entrance to prevent predators from getting in.When numbats roam, they walk or trot with a jerky movement. They can reach speeds of 32 km per hour when threatened. Occasionally they will stop to feed, while continuing to scan their surroundings for predators. When sitting, they take on the appearance of dasyurids, which are small carnivorous marsupials of Australia. Sitting vertically on their hind feet, numbats will keep their forepaw raised in alert. When excited or stressed, numbats arch their tail over their back and erect their fur.",
            "numbat communication": "These animals produce a variety of vocalizations, which are mainly used during the breeding season. If a female and male are both interested in one another, they will vocalize this by producing a series of soft clicks. However, a female will also produce a growling noise if she is rejecting a males advances.Numbats will also make noise when they are protecting their territory. These are usually hissing growls, which are similar to sounds the species makes when they are handled.Outside of this, the only other time thry can be heard is when a mother is caring for her young. The mother communicates with them by soft chirping sounds.",
            "numbat reproduction": "Leading up to the mating season, males will venture out to find a mate. When a male desires a certain female, he will follow her and pay particularly close attention to her cloacal region by sniffing it. Both the male and female will vocalize to one another, producing sounds that are composed of a series of soft clicks.When a male has found a female, he smears an oily, foul-smelling substance from his sternal gland around the female\u2019s territory, which wards off other males.Numbats breed in February and March. Copulation can take less than one minute to an hour and the male may leave immediately in order to mate with another female, or he may stay in the den until the breeding season is over. Numbats are not monogamous and males may mate with multiple females in one year.Female normally produce one litter a year. The gestation period is around 14 days, after which around four young are born. When born, newborn numbats range in length from less than 20 mm to 75 mm, and the snout is extremely shortened. The young nurse for up to 9 months, until about July or August. In late September, the young begin to forage for themselves, becoming independent and moving to a territory of their own by November.When the young reach the length of approximately 30 mm, a light downy coat arises, and this coat eventually bears the characteristic white stripes when they reach about 55 mm in length.Males play no part in raising the young. The reproductive cycles are seasonal, with the female producing one litter per year. The female is polyestrous, which means she has several estrous cycles during a single breeding season. Thus, females that have failed to conceive or have lost their young may conceive again with a subsequent mate.\u00a0Location and HabitatThe numbat were originally found across southern Australia from Western Australia across as far as northwestern New South Wales. However, since the arrival of Europeans, numbat have become extinct in 99% of their range. The species has survived only in several remnant populations in two small patches of land in the Dryandra Woodland and the Perup Nature Reserve, both in Western Australia. In recent years, it has, however, been successfully reintroduced into a few fenced reserves, including some in South Australia (Yookamurra Sanctuary) and New South Wales (Scotia Sanctuary).Numbats were historically found semi-arid and arid woodlands and grasslands. However, today they are found in areas of eucalypt forest. These are located at an elevation of approximately 317m, in the wettest edge of the former range because of the abundance of old and fallen trees. The logs of eucalypt woodlands play a great role in aiding in the survival of numbats.The numbat needs to live in an area where there are many termites for them to eat. If areas are too wet or too cold, termites will not flourish, and, thus, neither will numbats.Numbat Conservation StatusNumbats are currently listed by the US Fish & Wildlife Service and the IUCN Red List an Endangered. The numbat population has decreased rapidly in recent years, and it is thought that less than 1,000 remain in the world.The introduction of predators such as red foxes and raptors is mostly to blame for the decrease in their population, as well as other predators of the numbat such as rabbits and rats. Deforestation has also had a big effect on this species, resulting in habitat loss including the loss of logs and hollow trees. Deforestation has also contributed to the reduction in termites, which is the numbat\u2019s primary food source.Conservation efforts have been made to help with this endangered species, which include captive breeding, reintroduction programs, protected areas, and red fox control programs.",
            "predators": "Because of the small size of the numbat, they are easy prey to many animals. The most common predators of these animals are red foxes, raptors and feral cats. They can also be taken by carpet pythons, and large lizards, such as sand goannas.The numbat is constantly on alert when roaming and feeding and detects threats from predators primarily by sound (hearing the predator\u2019s approach) and vision (seeing their approach). They will freeze if they sense they are in danger, or run at fast speeds into their burrow. Numbats may also try to ward off predators by producing low-throaty growls along with a repetitive \u201ctut tut tut.\u201d",
            "numbat importance": "Numbats are very important to the ecosystem because they help to control termite populations. Ants can also accidentally be consumed by them, when they eat termites. There are no known adverse effects of numbats on humans.\u00a0\u00a0"

Adult Pumas are slender and agile cats who measure 2.4 metres (8 feet) in length from nose to tail (tail length is 80 centimetres (33 inches).They stand between 60 \u2013 76 centimetres (2 \u2013 2.5 feet) tall at the shoulder and weigh around 53 \u2013 72 kilograms (115 \u2013 160 pounds) in males and 34 \u2013 48 kilograms (75 \u2013 105 pounds) in females.Pumas have a plain colored fur ranging from tawny to silver grey or reddish brown. Pumas have lighter patches on their underparts including the jaws, chin and throat. Pumas have round heads and upright ears.Their front legs are larger than their hind legs and adapted for grasping prey. There are 5 retractable claws on their forepaws plus one dew claw and 4 on the back paws. Pumas have muscular necks and strong jaws. Pumas have acute hearing and excellent vision which makes them formidable hunters.The name of a male is referred to simply as a \u2018Puma\u2019, the female is referred to as a \u2018she-Puma\u2019 and the young are called \u2018cubs\u2019.\u00a0",
            "puma habitat": "The Puma has an extensive habitat range. It prefers habitats with dense underbrush and rocky areas for stalking, but it can also live in open plains, coniferous and tropical forests, swamps and deserts.\u00a0",
            "puma cat diet": "The Puma is a carnivorous stalker and ambush predator and pursues a wide variety of prey. Their main diet is ungulates such as deer, horses, elk, cattle and sheep. Basically, the puma will eat any animal it can catch, even animals as large as a moose.Pumas will stalk their prey through bushes and trees and across rock ledges before powerfully leaping onto the back of their victim and delivering a suffocating neck bite. The pumas agile spine is adapted for this killing technique.When large prey are killed, the puma is known to cover them with bush and return to feed over a period of days. They subsidise their diets with large insects and small rodents.\u00a0",
            "puma cat behaviour": "Puma Cats are territorial animals and territories depend on terrain, vegetation and the abundance of prey. Pumas are reclusive and will avoid areas where there are human settlements. Female territories are usually half the size of male territories which can measure between 58 to 386 square miles.Females mark their territories using scrape mark, urine and faeces which are also used to attract mates. Males may scrape together a small pile of leaves and grasses and then urinate on it as a way of marking their territory.Groups of pumas will only contain mothers and their young. Adult pumas only meet for breeding. Pumas are crepuscular and are most active at dawn and dusk.Pumas are vocal cats and are well known for their low pitched hisses, growls, purrs and screams. As they have the largest hind legs in the cat family, pumas are able to leap very high up to 5.4 metres (18 feet). Horizontal jumps can measure between 6 and 12 metres (20 \u2013 40 feet).They are very fast cats and can run at speeds of 35 miles per hour, although it is best adapted for short, sharp, powerful sprints. Pumas are good climbers and are capable of swimming.",
            "puma reproduction": "Female pumas reach sexual maturity between 1 \u2013 3 years. One litter of cubs is born every 2 \u2013 3 years. Females are in estrous for 8 days of a 23 day cycle. After a gestation period of 91 days, a litter of 1 \u2013 6 cubs are born.Maternal dens are usually caves or other covered areas offering protection for the cubs. Cubs are spotted and born with blue eyes and rings on their tails. Cubs are weaned around 3 months after birth and as they develop they accompany their mother to kill sites.At 6 months old, cubs hunt for small prey of the own. Female pumas will guard her cubs fiercely and successfully fight off animals as large as Grizzly Bears. Cubs will leave their mother to establish their own territory at around 2 years old. The life span of a puma cat in the wild is between 8 \u2013 13 years and 18 \u2013 19 years in captivity.\u00a0Puma Conservation StatusPumas are classed a \u2018Near Threatened\u2019 by the IUCN. The total breeding population of pumas is less than 50,000 individuals and continues to decline. Pumas have no particular threats from other animals besides humans, although it interacts with other large predators such as the Brown Bear and Grey Wolf in which it competes for prey.In some parts it may have to compete with the Jaguar and the American Alligator. When the puma cat and jaguars range overlaps, jaguars will dominate the larger prey and the puma will take the smaller prey.As of 1996, puma cat hunting was prohibited in Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, French Guiana, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, Venezuela, and Uruguay. Cougars are generally hunted with packs of dogs, until the animal is \u2018treed\u2019. When the hunter arrives on the scene, he shoots the cat from the tree at close range.The Cougar cannot be legally killed in California except under very specific circumstances, such as when an individual is declared a public safety threat.However statistics from the Department of Fish and Game indicate that cougar killings in California have been on the rise since 1970s with an average of over 112 cats killed per year from 2000 to 2006 compared to 6 per year in the 1970s."

            "desc": "Skunks are mammals in the family Mephitidae, of the order Carnivora. There are 10 extant species of skunk in three genus. Skunks are recognized by their unique appearance and warning coloration, and their ability to spray a liquid with a strong, unpleasant scent from their anal glands. Skunks can be found solely in the New World, across North America and South America. The different genus can be found in different areas. They inhabit woodlands, deserts, grasslands, and rocky montane areas, but do not occur in dense forest. These animals are mainly omnivorous, eating vegetation, insects and other small invertebrates, and smaller vertebrates. Skunks are generally abundant and are not considered to be endangered. However, certain species are considered rare or possibly threatened due to hurting by humans and demand for their fur.",
            "skunk species": "There are ten living species of skunk. These are:Genus: ConepatusConepatus chinga \u2013 Molina\u2019s hog-nosed skunkConepatus humboldtii \u2013 Humboldt\u2019s hog-nosed skunkConepatus leuconotus \u2013 American hog-nosed skunkConepatus semistriatus \u2013 striped hog-nosed skunkGenus: MephitisMephitis macroura \u2013 hooded skunkMephitis mephitis \u2013 striped skunkGenus: SpilogaleSpilogale angustifrons \u2013 southern spotted skunkSpilogale gracilis \u2013 western spotted skunkSpilogale putorius \u2013 eastern spotted skunkSpilogale pygmaea \u2013 pygmy spotted skunk\u00a0Skunk CharacteristicsThe different skunk species vary in size, ranging from 15.6 to 37 in (40 to 94 cm) long and 1.1 lb (0.50 kg) to 18 lb (8.2 kg). The smallest genus is Spilogale, containing the spotted skunks, while the largest of the skunks is the genus Conepatus, containing hog-nosed skunks.These animals are recognized by their their striking color patters. Skunks are usually black, but are sometimes brown, and have a prominent, contrasting pattern of white fur on their faces, backs and bushy tails. All skunks are striped, even from birth. They may have a single thick white stripe across the back and tail, two thinner stripes, or a series of white spots and broken stripes (in the case of the spotted skunk).These stripes across their back and tail are known as their warning coloration, and are there to ward off any predators.Skunks have moderately elongated bodies with relatively short, well-muscled legs and long front claws for digging. They have five toes on each foot. Their tail is thickly furred.",
            "skunk spray": "Skunks are probably best known for their anal scent glands, which can produce spray. They have two glands, one on each side of the anus, which produce a mixture of sulfur-containing chemicals such as thiols (traditionally called mercaptans), which have an offensive odor. This spray is so powerful it can ward off bears and other potential attackers. It can even cause irritation and even temporary blindness, and is sufficiently powerful to be detected by a human nose up to 5.6 km (3.5 miles) downwind!Muscles next to the scent glands allow skunks to spray with a high degree of accuracy, as far as 3 m (10 ft). They carry just enough of the chemical for five or six successive sprays, and require up to ten days to produce another supply.Skunks do not spray other skunks, except among males in the mating season.",
            "lifespan": "Skunks can live up to 7 years in the wild, although 5 to 6 years is more typical. They can live up to 10 years in captivity.Between 50% and 70% of juvenile skunks do not survive the first year, due to both predation and disease.",
            "diet": "Skunks are omnivores and eat vegetation, insects and small invertebrates, and smaller vertebrates. Their most common foods of choice are larvae, earthworms, grubs, rodents, lizards, salamanders, frogs, snakes, birds, moles, and eggs. They also commonly eat berries, roots, leaves, grasses, fungi and nuts.They are nocturnal animals and forage for food during the night. They root along the ground and dig up their prey. While they do not have good eyesight to find their prey, they do have an excellent sense of smell.",
            "behavior": "Skunks are usually solitary animals when they are not breeding, although may gather together for communal warmth in the coldest parts of their range. They are not typically aggressive towards each other, but males will defend females during the mating season.They are crepuscular, but also hunt during the night, spending the day sheltering in their burrows which they can dig with their powerful front claws.Aside from using their spray and their warning coloration to deter predators, skunks also hiss, foot-stamp and exhibit threat postures. While skunks do not spray each other, they will fight with their teeth and claws over den space.Skunks do not actually hibernate during the winter, but do go into their dens for extended periods of time. During this time, they remain generally inactive and feed rarely, going through a dormant stage. Over winter, multiple females (as many as 12) huddle together.These animals are not vocal, but sometimes communicate with grunts, growls, and hisses.",
            "reproduction": "Not a lot is known about the reproductive habits of the skunk. They are seasonal breeders and the breeding season lasts two to three months, but the time of the breeding season varies among species. It is usually in the spring time. Skunks are polygynous and males may fight with one another to breed with a female.The gestation period is around 66 days. Before giving birth, the female excavates a den to house her litter of kits. The litter size varies from 2 to 10 kits, which are born blind, deaf, but already covered by a soft layer of fur. About three weeks after birth, they first open their eyes and the kits are weaned about two months after birth. Young skunks generally stay with their mother until they are ready to mate, which is at around one year of age.Females are very protective of their young and will spray any predators, but males play no part in raising their young.\u00a0Skunk Location and HabitatThe different species of skunk live in different areas of the New World. Mephitis ranges from southern Canada to Costa Rica, Conepatus ranges from the Southern United States to Argentina, and Spilogale ranges from Southern British Columbia in the west, and Pennsylvania in the east, south to Costa Rica.These animals are usually found in relatively open forests, grasslands, agricultural areas, meadows, open fields, and rocky montane areas. They spend the day undercover, usually in burrows or under the cover of rocks or logs. They can dig the burrows themselves, or may use the dens of other species, such as marmots or badgers. Males and females occupy overlapping home ranges through the greater part of the year, typically 2 to 4 km2 (0.77 to 1.54 sq mi) for females and up to 20 km2 (7.7 sq mi) for males.Some skunks are also agile climbers, and can be found in trees in search of food or to avoid predators.Skunk Conservation StatusSkunks are not generally thought to be in any danger of population decline, and they are generally abundant across their range. However, some species are considered rare or possibly threatened, and the Palawan stink badger is currently listed as vulnerable on the IUCN red list, due to human induced habitat degradation and fragmentation.Humans are adult skunks largest threat. Skunks are considered to be pests due to their smell and their occasional predation on domestic poultry and eggs. They are often shot or killed by humans. Skunks also have very bad eyesight, which often results in them wandering out onto roads and being hit by cars.The pelts of skunks are sometimes traded, although they are currently not in high demand.",
            "predators": "Despite their warning coloration and their stink, skunks are still at risk of predation from larger carnivores such as coyotes, foxes, pumas, civets, American badgers, and lynx. Eagles and owls, particularly great-horned owls, are known to prey on skunks.Juvenile skunks are much more likely to be preyed on than adults, with 50 to 70% not making it through the first year of life.\u00a0Skunk FAQsWhat do skunks eat?Skunks are omnivores and eat a variety of different foods. These include larvae, earthworms, grubs, rodents, lizards, salamanders, frogs, snakes, birds, moles, and eggs. They will also eat berries, roots, leaves, grasses, fungi and nuts.Do skunks hibernate?Skunks do not actually hibernate, but in the coldest months will stay huddled in their dens and become pretty inactive. During this time they eat very little and sleep quite a lot.Are skunks nocturnal?Skunks are commonly active during the night, but they are actually crepuscular, meaning they are most active during the twilight period. They shelter in their burrows during the day.Where do skunks live?Skunks live in different areas depending on their species. Hooded and striped skunks range from southern Canada to Costa Rica, hog-nosed skunks range from the Southern United States to Argentina, and spotted skunks range from Southern British Columbia in the west, and Pennsylvania in the east, south to Costa Rica.They spend the day in burrows in open forests, grasslands, agricultural areas, meadows, open fields, and rocky montane areas. They can either dig these burrows themselves, or use dens leftover by other species.\u00a0"

            "desc": "Slipper lobsters make up the family Scyllaridae in the order Decapoda. There are around 90 species of these achelate (clawless) decapod crustaceans, split into 21 genera, which are placed in four subfamilies: Arctidinae, Ibacinae, Scyllarinae and Theninae. Slipper lobsters are not true lobsters, but are more closely related to spiny lobsters and furry lobsters. They are recognizable because of their large antennae, flat bodies, and the fact that they do not have two large front claws. Most slipper lobsters live in warm oceans across the world from the surface all the way down to depths of about 500 metres (1,600 ft). There is quite a variation among the species of slipper lobsters in terms of size and weight, but all are edible and many species are of great economic importance to fisheries.",
            "slipper lobster lifespan": "The exact lifespan of the slipper lobster is unknown, but it is thought that they may live for up to 10 to 15 years in the wild.\u00a0",
            "slipper lobster diet": "Slipper lobsters are carnivores and eat mollusks like limpets, oysters, and other sea anemones including sea urchins and worms. They also eat crustaceans, polychaetes and echinoderms. These lobsters also scavenge on dead animal matter. They use their jaws and limbs to crack open shellfish.\u00a0",
            "slipper lobster behavior": "Slipper lobsters are nocturnal, spending the day hiding in cracks and crevices to help them escape from predators. They mostly live on their own, and it is thought that they probably communicate with others within their species, although it is not known how.While these animals do not have front claws that they can use to defend themselves from predators, slipper lobsters can escape predators by using their flat body; they can lie very flat in the substrate and the bottom of the ocean and go largely unnoticed by preying sea creatures.They also use their unique coloring to help camouflage themselves from predators, and can cling to rocks so they really blend in.In general, these lobsters move pretty slowly on the seafloor, but when they have to be faster or flee, they tuck or curl and uncurl their tail under their abdomens while walking or swimming.\u00a0",
            "slipper lobster reproduction": "Male slipper lobsters deposit a sperm packet, scientifically known as a spermatophore, on the underside of a female lobster during mating. Then the female lobster releases a large number of eggs (up to 100,000 eggs!). She carries these beneath her body for around two weeks, during which time the color of these changes from orange to brown. These eggs then hatch into very small floating larvae.Young slipper lobsters go through around ten developmental stages or phases when hatched out of the egg. This can take up to a year after which the larva moults into a \u201cnisto\u201d stage that lasts a few weeks. From here, almost nothing is known about the transition to the adult stage, although it is thought they continue to grow through a series of moults.\u00a0Slipper Lobster Location and HabitatSlipper lobsters live in warm oceans around the world. The exact areas in which they live varies depending on the species. They are typically bottom dwellers of the continental shelves, found at depths of up to 500 metres (1,600 ft).\u00a0Slipper Lobster Conservation StatusAll species of slipper lobster are edible, and most are caught for their meat. Some species have much higher commercial value than others, with some species only being sold when they have been accidentally caught by fishermen. Slipper lobster tails are very popular throughout the world.There is not an accurate population count for most species of slipper lobster, but it is thought that they are not endangered or threatened. Their numbers may be declining, however, due to overfishing and climate change.",
            "predators": "The main predators of slipper lobsters are bony fish.\u00a0Slipper Lobster FAQsCan you eat slipper lobster?Yes! All species of slipper lobster are edible, and most are caught and sold for their meat. These animals have huge economic importance in many areas, and slipper lobster meat can be very sought after.How many species of slipper lobster are there?There are around 90 species of slipper lobster! These are split into 21 genera.Where do slipper lobsters live?Slipper lobsters live all over the world. They can be found in warm seas, such as the Pacific Ocean, and live on the bottom of the seabed amongst substrate.What do slipper lobsters eat?Slipper lobsters eat a variety of molluscs, including limpets, mussels and oysters, as well as crustaceans, polychaetes and echinoderms.How do lobsters communicate?Lobsters cannot produce verbal sounds because they do not have any vocal chords. In fact, they communicate mostly using urine. To put it very simply, they squirt pee at each other\u2019s faces to communicate!Lobsters urinate from their faces so this is easy for them to do. Pheromones are injected into their urine, and so, when they pee, they release these pheromones and can lets other lobsters know how they are feeling.Do lobsters mate for life?It is a popular theory that lobsters mate for life, but in reality, it isn\u2019t true. These animals can create a monogamous bond, but it only lasts for two weeks.How long can lobsters live out of water?Lobsters can live for around one to two days out of water, if they are kept cool, moist and refrigerated. Because they are gill breathers, they can be kept alive for a short amount of time with newspaper and/or seaweed. This helps to keep them moist.\u00a0Slipper Lobster TaxonomyThere are four subfamilies of the family Scyllaridae \u2014 Arctidinae, Ibacinae, Scyllarinae and Theninae \u2014 with 21 genera split amongst these.

Let\u2019s take a look at some of the most known species, and their common names and scientific names, in greater detail.Flathead lobsterGenus: ThenusSpecies: Thenus orientalisThe flathead lobster is found in the Indo-West Pacific area, from East Africa to China and southern Japan. They reside at a depth of 8 to 70 m.These slipper lobsters get their name due to the fact they have a flat head. They have a pale reddish-brown hue, with upper parts being a mild purple-brown color with orangish-yellow legs. They measure around 9.8 in (25 cm) in length and can weigh over 1.1 lb (0.5 kg).The conservation status of flathead slipper lobster is Least Concern. Given their range, they are the most commonly found slipper lobsterMediterranean slipper lobsterGenus: ScyllaridesSpecies: Scyllarides latusThe Mediterranean slipper lobster is found in the Mediterranean Sea and in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. They live on rocky or sandy substrates at depths of 4 to 100 metres (13 to 328 ft).They can grow to a total body length about 45 centimetres (18 in), although rarely more than 30 cm (12 in), and can weigh as much as 1.5 kilograms (3.3 lb). They are cryptically colored, allowing them to blend in with their surroundings.The Mediterranean slipper lobster is edible, but it is a relatively rare species, and is therefore of little interest to fisheries. However, it is caught in small numbers throughout its distribution. Its population numbers are unknown and is therefore listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List.Balmain bug lobsterGenus: IbacusSpecies: Ibacus peroniiThe Balmain bug lobster, also known as the butterfly fan lobster, is found in shallow waters around Australia. They live at depths of 20 to 450 metres (66 to 1,476 ft).It is reddish brown in color, measuring up to 23 cm (9 in) long and 14 cm (6 in) wide. They usually weigh around 120 grams (4.2 oz), but the weight can range from 80 to 200 g (2.8 to 7.1 oz).The Balmain bug lobster is the most commercially important species in the genus Ibacus. Only the tail contains edible meat and it is sometimes reported as tasting of garlic. Despite commerical fishing, they are listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.Ridged slipper lobsterGenus: ScyllaridesSpecies: Scyllarides nodiferThe ridged slipper lobster is found in the Western Atlantic region, around Bermuda and the coast of the USA south of Cape Lookout, North Carolina, and around the entire Gulf of Mexico. They typically reside at depths between 2 and 91 m on a sandy substrate, sometimes mixed with mud, shells or corals.This slipper lobster has unique coloring, with white and red striped bands on its legs. They have a total body length of about 35 cm. The ridged slipper lobster is currently listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. It is only minimally commercially fished.Japanese fan lobsterGenus: IbacusSpecies: Ibacus ciliatusThe Japanese fan lobster is found in the western Pacific Ocean from the Philippines to the Korean Peninsula and southern Japan. It is the only species of Ibacus not known to occur around the coast of Australia. The Japanese fan lobster lives on soft substrates at depths of 49 to 324 metres (161 to 1,063 ft), at temperatures of 14 to 24 \u00b0C (57 to 75 \u00b0F).This slipper lobster is reddish brown in color and has a total length up to 23 centimetres (9.1 in). Its body appears to \u201cfan out\u201d more than other slipper lobsters, hence its name.The Japanese fan lobster is harvested throughout its range, although there is little data on the quantities being caught. It is listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List.Small European locust lobsterGenus: ScyllarusSpecies: Scyllarus arctusThe small European locust lobster is found throughout the Mediterranean Sea, and in eastern parts of the Atlantic Ocean, from the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands as far north as the English Channel. It lives at depths of 4 to 50 m on muddy or rocky substrates.This slipper lobster is relatively small, around 5 to 10 cm (2.0 to 3.9 in) in length. It is reddish-brown in color, with a dark brown spot in the centre of each abdominal somite, although this is not sharply defined.The small European locust lobster is the subject of small scale fishery, but its scarcity and its small size make it an unattractive target. It is currently listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.Spanish slipper lobsterGenus: ScyllarusSpecies: Scyllarus aequinoctialisThe Spanish slipper lobster is found in the western Atlantic Ocean from South Carolina to S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil, including the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea and Bermuda. They usually reside between 0.6 and 64 m, on a substrate of sand or rocks, often on the outer reefs.This slipper lobster can grow up to 30 centimetres long, with a carapace 12 cm long. They are yellowish to reddish with brown spots. One of their main features is a horseshoe shaped black spot just behind its carapace on the first tail segment, which is flanked by two more black spots.The Spanish slipper lobster is fished, but is not of great economic importance. It is eaten, but is not one of the main exports in its areas. Its meat sometimes serves as bait in lobsterpots.Blunt slipper lobsterGenus: ScyllaridesSpecies: Scyllarides squammosusThe blunt slipper lobster is found throughout the Indo-West Pacific region, from Australia (Queensland, New South Wales, West Australia), Japan, Hawaii, Melanesia, New Caledonia to East Africa. It resides at depths from 7.5 m to 71 m.This slipper lobster is predominantly a light reddish brown color mixed with yellow in some areas. The first segment of its tail is a light yellow with three characteristic circular brown marks on it. Their eyes are ringed with orange dots. It has a total body length about 40 cm.The blunt slipper lobster is highly sought-after, particularly because of its large size and well developed fleshy tail. However, it is scarce and lives in inaccessible places and therefore is not commercially fished.Sculptured mitten lobsterGenus: ParribacusSpecies: Parribacus antarcticusThe sculptured mitten lobster is found along the western coast the Atlantic Ocean from Florida to northern Brazil, along the southern coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean, and in Hawaii and Polynesia in the South Pacific Ocean. It usually resides in the shallow water of lagoons and coral or stone marine reefs, preferably with a sandy bottom, at a depth of 0 to 20 m.These slipper lobsters are yellowish in color, mottled with brown and black patches. The lateral margin shows large teeth banded with yellow, orange and light purple. They can reach about 20 cm in length.The sculptured mitten lobster is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. The taste of these lobsters is always praised, but there is no special fishery for them. The species is considered too small and the abdomen too flat to be of commercial interest. It is sold fresh or cooked and used for local consumption.Japanese mitten lobsterGenus: ParribacusSpecies: Parribacus japonicusThe Japanese mitten lobster is found the northwestern coast of Japan, west of Maizuru, and on the Pacific coast of Japan, from Tokyo Bay to southwest of the Ryukyu Islands, and even further south the Pacific Ocean towards the northeast coast of Taiwan. It resides on the reefs of continental shelves, at depths of up to 20 meters (66 feet).This slipper lobster can grow to a length of up to 16 centimeters, with females being larger than males. Its carapace and upper abdomen are brown, its anterior edge has a bluish tinge, and its lower body and legs are yellowish brown. It also has protrusions on the side of its back that are purple.The Japanese mitten lobster is fished locally, trapped in gill nets by local fishermen and sold for its meat. However, it has little economic importance and is not fished on a wide commercial scale. It is currently Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List.Galapagos slipper lobsterGenus: ScyllaridesSpecies: Scyllarides astoriThe Galapagos slipper lobster is found in the Eastern Pacific, around the Gulf of California and Mexico and around the Gal\u00e1pagos Archipelago and Ecuador. It resides in shallow water, around 10 m deep, on rocky substrate.It has a total length up to about 25 cm and has a unique maroon color. There is no special fishery for this species, but animals are occasionally caught and used for food. They are caught too infrequently to be of economic importance.Small Spanish lobsterGenus: ArctidesSpecies: Arctides guineensisThe small Spanish lobster is found in the Bermuda Triangle. It was described in 1799, making it one of the first slipper lobsters to be described. These slipper lobsters reach a maximum length of 20 centimetres (7.9 in). They are listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. The species is too rare to be of much economic interest.Aesop slipper lobsterGenus: ScyllaridesSpecies: Scyllarides haaniiThe Aesop slipper lobster is found in the eastern and western Indian Ocean and throughout the Pacific Ocean. It is a wide-ranging benthic species but is not really abundant anywhere. It resides at depths of 10 to 135 m (30 to 440 ft), in coral reefs and rocky bottoms.This species is thought to be the largest of the Scyllarides genus, and can grow to a maximum body length of 50.5 cm (20 in), but more commonly ranges between 16 and 30 cm (6 and 12 in) in length.The Aesop slipper lobster is targeted by fisheries and is caught frequently, but due to its wide distribution and occurrence in at least one protection area, it is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.Three-spot slipper lobsterGenus: ScyllaridesSpecies: Scyllarides delfosiThe three-spot slipper lobster is found in the Western Atlantic region, along the north coast of South America from Venezuela to Brazil. It resides in substrate mud, at depths between 42 and 80 m.It has one circular central spot and two irregularly shaped lateral spots on its dorsal surface, hence its name. This slipper lobster has a total body length of 25 cm. It is not commercially fished in large quantities and is listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List.Hooded slipper lobsterGenus: ScyllaridesSpecies: Scyllarides deceptorThe hooded slipper lobster is found in the Western Atlantic region, from southern Brazil south to northern Argentina. It resides at depths between 45 and 200 m.This slipper lobster has a body length measuring between 13 to 27 cm. It is not specifically fished and is too rare to be of economic importance, but the hooded slipper lobster is occasionally caught in traps.Red slipper lobsterGenus: ScyllaridesSpecies: Scyllarides herklotsiiThe red slipper lobster is found from Senegal south to Ponta do Pinda, Angola. It usually lives at depths of 5 to 70 metres (16 to 230 ft), but has been recorded from depths as great as 200 m (660 ft). It prefers sandy and rocky substrates.This species can reach a total length of 32 centimetres (13 in), but does not generally exceed 25 cm (9.8 in) long. It is not commercially fished and is only taken by accident. It is listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List.Cape slipper lobsterGenus: ScyllaridesSpecies: Scyllarides elisabethaeThe Cape slipper lobster is found in the Indo-West Pacific region, around South Eastern Africa. They usually reside at depths between 37 to 380 m, on a substrate of fine sediments, mud or fine sand. Their body has a total length of around 20 cm. They are not of great economic importance.Clamkiller slipper lobsterGenus: ScyllaridesSpecies: Scyllarides tridacnophagaThe clamkiller slipper lobster is found in the Indo-West Pacific region, around the Red Sea, East Africa (Somalia, Kenya), Gulf of Aden, Pakistan and the west coast of Thailand. Its depth ranges from 5 to 112 m. It has a total body length of about 30 cm. Due to its size, it is commercially caught for its meat.Smooth fan lobsterGenus: IbacusSpecies: Ibacus novemdentatusThe smooth fan lobster is found in the Indo-West Pacific region and usually resides from 37 to 400 m deep. Its total body length is usually about 19 cm, with a carapace length of 3 to 7.7 cm. In Korea and Japan, as well as in Taiwan, this species is sold at the markets.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "image": "https://animalcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Spotted-Hyena-340x200.png",
            "desc": "The spotted hyena (scientific name: Crocuta crocuta), also known as the laughing hyena, is a hyena species native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is the sole extant member of the genus Crocuta and is the largest known member of the family Hyaenidae, which contains only three other species: the brown hyena, the aardwolf and the striped hyena. It differs from these animals in appearance though, with its vaguely bear-like build, its rounded ears, its less prominent mane and its spotted pelt. The spotted hyena is found in many types of open, dry habitat including semi-desert, savannah, acacia bush, and mountainous forest. It is the most common large carnivore in Africa, thanks to its great adaptability and opportunism when it comes to hunting and feeding. It is also very fast, and can run at speeds of up to 60 km/h.",
            "spotted hyena lifespan": "The spotted hyena is thought to live for up to 25 years in the wild, and up to 40 years in captivity.\u00a0",
            "spotted hyena diet": "The spotted hyena is the most carnivorous member of the Hyaenidae and is a predator, not a scavenger, unlike the brown and striped species of hyena. The most commonly taken prey by these animals are wildebeest, zebra, antelope, Thomson\u2019s gazelle,Grant\u2019s gazelle, greater kudu, impala, giraffe, cape buffalo, springbok, gemsbok, bushbuck, suni, gerenuk, Warthog, hare, springhare, ostrich eggs, bat-eared fox, golden jackal, porcupine and puff adder. They will also feed on carcasses of much larger animals, such as African elephants and lions.Spotted hyenas are one of the top predators in Africa. They usually hunt in groups of 2 to 5 individuals, although zebra are hunted in larger groups. They use their keen sense of sight, hearing and smell to hunt live prey and to detect carrion from afar.During a hunt, spotted hyenas often run through ungulate herds in order to select an individual to attack. They also often chase their prey long distances at speeds up to 60 km/hr.\u00a0",
            "spotted hyena behavior": "Spotted hyenas can be active both day and night, depending on their needs and whether there are humans around, but they are generally nocturnal. Thanks to their good eyesight and sharp hearing, they can hunt for food when it is dark. This also helps to keep them cool.\u00a0",
            "clans": "Spotted hyenas are the most social of the order Carnivora and live in social groups called clans, which may contain between 3 and 80 members. Larger spotted hyena clans generally occur in prime territory with large prey concentrations.Spotted hyenas are matriarchal with females dominant to all males, and females remain in their natal clan for their entire lives, while males disperse upon reaching sexual maturity. Cubs take the rank directly below their mothers at birth. So when the matriarch passes away, their youngest female cub will take over as matriarch.Once a male joins another clan, he enters a dominance queue that the other males respect. As more males enter the queue and older males die, the male will move up through the social rank. Lower ranking males spend a long time developing relationships with females in the clan, following females for periods of days or weeks and eventually gaining favor with the females.Despite the fact that spotted hyenas are members of large groups, they are only seen in these clans at kills, when defending the territory, or at a communal den. At all other times, they congregate in small groups or are seen alone.\u00a0",
            "territory": "Spotted hyena territory can range from less than 40 km2 to over 1,000 km2. These territories are marked using vocal displays and scent marking. Scent marks are deposited from a secretion of the anal gland and from a secretion of glands on the feet. These animals also use communal latrines to mark territory boundaries.Territories are usually respected, with members of clans observed giving up on chasing prey when the prey crosses into another clan\u2019s range. Despite this, in times of food shortage, territorial boundaries will be ignored.Males are more likely to enter another clan\u2019s territory than females are, as they are less attached to their natal group and will leave it when in search of a mate. Hyenas can be accepted into other clans if they are persistent in wandering into a territory.\u00a0",
            "communication": "These animals use both vocalizations and body language to communicate with each other. They have an extensive vocal range and the spotted hyena is often called the laughing hyena thanks to their \u201cgiggling\u201d.Other sounds range from whoops, fast whoops, grunts, groans, lows, yells, growls, soft grunt-laughs, loud grunt-laughs, whines and soft squeals. These sounds can be used for greetings, excitement, impatience, fear and aggression.Body language includes greeting ceremonies between clan-members, during which two individuals stand parallel to each other and face opposite directions. Both individuals raise their hind legs and lick each other\u2019s anogenital area.Spotted hyenas may also lower their hindquarters when being attacked, fold their ears and bare their teeth when afraid, and carry their tail forward on their back when excited. Chemical communication is used too in the form of scent marking.\u00a0",
            "intelligence": "Spotted hyenas are thought to be very intelligent animals. For example, they seem to plan on hunting specific species in advance, using scent marking before setting off to hunt zebras.They also have been recorded using deceptive behaviour, including giving alarm calls during feeding when no enemies are present, thus frightening off other hyenas and allowing them to temporarily eat in peace.Similarly, mothers will emit alarm calls when attempting to interrupt attacks on their cubs by other hyenas.\u00a0",
            "spotted hyena reproduction": "Spotted hyenas are polygynous. Members of both sexes may copulate with several mates over the course of several years. Females usually favour younger males born or joined into the clan after they were born.Males perform a bowing display to females before mating. The male lowers his muzzle to the ground, advances quickly toward the female, bows again, and then paws the ground close behind the female. Because of the dominance of females, males are timid and will retreat immediately if the alpha female shows any aggression.Spotted hyenas are non-seasonal breeders, although a birth peak does occur during the wet season. Female hyenas are polyestrous, with an estrus period lasting two weeks. Copulation is difficult because of the females pseudo-penis, but it lasts a relatively short time \u2014 between 4 and 12 minutes.Spotted hyenas give birth in dens, which are the focal point of a clan. Dens are used by several females at once, and it is not uncommon to see up to 20 cubs at a single site. These den sites might be used for years, while some clans prefer to use several different dens within a year.Dens are usually not dug by the spotted hyenas themselves and are abandoned burrows of warthogs, springhares and jackals. They usually have more than a dozen entrances, and are mostly located on flat ground. The tunnels are oval in section, and are wider than they are high.The gestation period for spotty hyenas is around 110 days and the average litter consists of two cubs. After copulation, males play no part in raising the young. The cubs are born with soft, brownish black hair, and weigh 1.5 kg on average. They are also born with their eyes open and with 6 to 7 mm long canine teeth and 4 mm long incisors.Cubs will often attack each other shortly after birth. This is particularly apparent in same sexed litters, and can result in the death of the weaker cub. Mothers are very protective of their cubs and will not allow other adults, particularly males, approaching them.Cubs will nurse from their mother for 12 to 16 months, though they can process solid food as early as three months. Also at around three months, the cubs begin to lose the black coat and develop the spotted, lighter colored coat.Spotted hyenas each sexual maturity at the age of three years and females are capable of producing a litter every 11 to 21 months.Although individual spotted hyenas only care for their own young, and males take no part in raising their young, cubs are able to identify relatives as distantly related as great-aunts throughout their lives.\u00a0Spotted Hyena Location and HabitatThe spotted hyena\u2019s range once encompassed almost all of Africa and Eurasia. The causes of the species\u2019 extinction in Eurasia are still largely unknown. It is thought that they became extinct from Western Europe loss of lowland habitats favoured by the animals 12,500 years ago.Nowadays, the spotted hyena is fairly widespread throughout sub-Saharan Africa, although its distribution is patchy in some places, particularly in West Africa. Mostly, these animals can be found in Tanzania, Ethiopia, Kenya, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Congo, Sudan, Central African Republic, Cameroon, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Mali, Senegal, and Sierra Leone.The spotted hyena resides in many types of open, dry habitat including semi-desert, savanna, acacia bush, and mountainous forest. It is not present in the most extreme desert conditions, tropical rainforests and the top of alpine mountains.The brown and striped hyena species are more common in desert habitats than the spotted species, but will be found in greater abundance than other hyena species in dense forested habitat. They have also been recorded as high as 4,000 meters in east Africa and Ethiopia.Spotted Hyena Conservation StatusSpotted hyenas are widespread throughout their range and their global population is estimated to be between 27,000 and 47,000 individuals. Because of this, they are listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.Despite this, there are concerns for the spotted hyena population, especially in relation to hunting and climate change. Effects on their environment such as drought, desertification, eradication could be causing a decline in this species, and commercial and trophy hunting is also a big threat.In fact, in some areas where this is no legal protection outside of national parks and reserves, such as in Nigeria, Kenya and Zimbabwe, spotted hyenas are severely threatened.",
            "spotted hyena predators and competitors": "Spotted hyenas are very clever predators and therefore do not have many predators of their own. The most common predator of the hyenas are lions, but this is because hyenas and lions compete directly for food and often scavenge each other\u2019s kills. This competition can sometimes lead to altercations which can result in death. Despite this, lions typically ignore spotted hyenas, unless they are on a kill or are being harassed by them. The spotted hyena will also avoid crocodile-infested waters, as they will prey on the hyena if given the opportunity.Spotted hyenas have other competitors in the wild, too. While cheetahs and leopards usually prey on smaller animals than those hunted by spotted hyenas, hyenas will steal their kills when the opportunity presents itself. Cheetahs are easily intimidated by hyenas, and put up little fight, while male leopards may stand up to hyenas.Spotted hyenas will also follow packs of African wild dogs in order to steal their kills. Black-backed and side-striped jackals, and African golden wolves will feed alongside hyenas, though they will be chased if they approach too closely.Where their ranges overlap, spotted hyenas dominate other hyena species. They will often steal other hyenas kills, and may even attack and kill other species.",
            "spotted hyena importance": "Spotted hyenas are the most common large predator in Africa and are, therefore, very important in their ecosystem. They help to keep the population of other species in check. They are also important to the tourism industry in Africa, with many people travelling to see these animals on safaris.While spotted hyenas are not in demand from trophy hunters because they are not viewed as very attractive, they are stilled killed by hunters occasionally and have been used for food and medicine in the past.\u00a0Spotted Hyena FAQsWhere do spotted hyenas live?Spotted hyenas live in sub-Saharan Africa. They mostly reside in savannas, grasslands, woodlands, forest edges, subdeserts, and even mountains. They do not live in extreme climates, such as deserts or tropical rainforests.How fast can spotted hyenas run?Spotted hyenas can run pretty fast \u2014 up to 60 km/hr over long distances when chasing their prey. However, this is not as fast as lions, cheetahs or gazelles.How big are spotted hyenas?Spotted hyenas are the largest member of the family Hyaenidae. They can weigh up to 69.2 kg (153 lb) and measure 165.8 cm (65 in) in length. Females are larger and heavier than males.Are spotted hyenas dangerous to humans?Yes! These animals can target humans and there have been several records of hyenas doing this. They are particularly dangerous when protecting their young and territory. The bite force of spotted hyenas is 1100 PSI, which is powerful enough to shatter bones. They have even been known to consume humans after killing them.Articles that Mention Spotted HyenasCheetahs vs LeopardsBig Five African GameAfrican AnimalsUgly Five Animals of Africa"

            "desc": "Thomson\u2019s Gazelle The Thomson\u2019s Gazelle is the smallest, daintiest and fastest of all gazelles. Sometimes referred to as \u2018Tommy\u2019, this gazelle was named after the Scottish explorer, Joseph Thomson who explored Africa in 1890. These graceful antelopes are still one of the most common gazelles in East Africa and although numbers may have declined in other parts of Africa, the Thomson\u2019s Gazelle still thrives on farmland, grasslands and savannas in the East.  Thomson\u2019s Gazelles are 70 \u2013 90 centimetres in length and 60 \u2013 90 centimetres tall. They weigh around 12 \u2013 85 kilograms (26 \u2013 187 pounds). Male Thomson\u2019s Gazelles are slightly larger than females. These attractive gazelles have a light brown coat and white underparts. They can be distinguished from the Grant\u2019s Gazelle by their dark stripe which extends across their flanks. Their rump is white which extends to just underneath their tale.",
            "description": "Thomson\u2019s Gazelles are 70 \u2013 90 centimetres in length and 60 \u2013 90 centimetres tall. They weigh around 12 \u2013 85 kilograms (26 \u2013 187 pounds).

They can be distinguished from the Grant\u2019s Gazelle by their dark stripe which extends across their flanks. Their rump is white which extends to just underneath their tale.Thomson\u2019s Gazelles have a thin black stripe on their face which runs down from the eye, a dark marking on their nose and a pale patch on their forehead. Males have long pointed horns which are marked with around 20 rings and are curved backwards with the tips curving forwards. Females have either no horns at all or small, short, slim horns.Thomson\u2019s Gazelles have slender legs and a short, black tail which is constantly in motion swinging back and forth like a window blade wiper. They have large ears and eyes and a narrow muzzle. Their heads are small and they have a lightweight body which enables them to run fast and make sharp turns. To make up for their vulnerability out on the plains, gazelles have an excellent sense of hearing which makes them exceptionally alert to sounds. They also have excellent smell and sight which is their main source of communicating with each other.Male gazelles are called \u2018bucks\u2019 and female gazelles are called \u2018does\u2019.",
            "habitat": "Thomson\u2019s Gazelles are found on dry, grassy plains in Sudan, Tanzania and the serengeti areas of Kenya. They prefer grasslands and shrubby steppes with heavily grazed, trampled grass. The gazelles can remain on pastures long after larger herbivores have left.",
            "diet": "Thomson\u2019s Gazelles are herbivores. Thomson\u2019s Gazelles feed upon grass and other low vegetation. They will also browse on shrubs. Most of their required water comes from the vegetation they eat although they rely more on water than the Grant\u2019s Gazelle. Thomson\u2019s Gazelles gather in large herds to feed, perhaps because of safety in numbers. They will also congregate with wildebeests, zebra and cattle as these larger animals will trample tall grasses making it much easier for the gazelle to eat the short grass.",
            "behaviour": "The gazelle is a main food item of many savanna predators such as lions, leopards, hyenas, hunting dogs and cheetahs. Thomson\u2019s Gazelles are very fast animals and can sometimes outrun their predators. During their initial flight from their attackers, a gazelle may sprint at up to 80 kilometres per hour (50 miles per hour) for around 15 \u2013 20 minutes. These impressive sprinters also run in special ways to communicate with the rest of their herd and confuse their pursuer. As the gazelles race along in their escape, they perform sudden bounding leaps in high arcs. This behaviour is called \u2018pronking\u2019 or \u2018stotting\u2019 and it makes it more difficult for the gazelle to be brought down by their predator.When a gazelle spots a stalking predator, it will pronk or stott to alert other gazelles to the danger and can also startle their predator. Another possibility for this behaviour is that it demonstrates their fitness in hope that the predator will give up the chase or that the predator should not bother trying to chase the obviously agile gazelle.Thomson\u2019s Gazelles are social animals and live in herds of over 200 individuals. Thomson\u2019s Gazelles sometimes congregate with other hoofed animals such as zebra and other species of antelope. During migration, thousands of gazelles will travel together in search of water during the dry season. Their territories may overlap with other species of ungulates with no problems. However, some may be more territorial and defend their territories vigorously if challenged. The defending male will clash horns with his opponent, the winner then claims the territory.Thomson\u2019s Gazelles mark the boundaries of their territory with a small secretion from scent glands located beneath their eyes. They deposit the secretion onto a blade of grass around 20 feet apart daily.",
            "reproduction": "Female gazelles usually give birth after the rainy season to a single young, known as a Fawn, after a gestation period of 5 \u2013 6 months. After giving birth, for the first 3 weeks the mother hides the fawn in tall grass and returns twice daily to nurse it until it is old enough to join the herd.Fawns have a tawny coloring which helps them stay camouflaged when hiding in open country. They can also stay very still for long periods of time. Although adult gazelles can out run a lion or cheetah, almost half of all fawns will be lost to predators before reaching adulthood. Female Thomson\u2019s Gazelles can give birth twice a year which is unusual for ungulates. The life span of a Thomson\u2019s Gazelle is 10 \u2013 15 years in the wild.",
            "conservation status": "Although numbers in some areas of Africa have declined due to hunting and habitat loss, the Thomson\u2019s Gazelle is not threatened and is classed as \u2018Least Concern\u2019 by the IUCN."

            "image": "https://animalcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tiger-shark-2-340x200.jpg",
            "desc": "The Tiger Shark is one of the largest sharks in the world. The Tiger shark is found in many of the tropical and temperate regions of the worlds oceans and is especially common around islands in the central Pacific. It is the only member of the genus \u2018Galeocerdo\u2019. The Tiger shark is often found close to the coast, in mainly tropical and sub-tropical waters, though they can reside in temperate waters.",
            "characteristics": "The Tiger shark is a member of the order Carcharhiniformes members of this order are characterized by the presence of a nictitating membrane over the eyes, two dorsal fins, an anal fin and five gill slits. It is the largest member of the Carcharhinidae family, commonly referred to as requiem sharks. This family includes some other well known sharks such as the blue shark, lemon shark and bull shark.Mature sharks average 3.25 metres (11 feet) to 4.25 metres (14 feet) in length and weigh 385 to 909 kilograms (850 to 2000 pounds). The heaviest specimen recorded to date, a shark caught in Newcastle, NSW, Australia in 1954 and measuring a mere 5.5 metres (18 feet), weighed 1,524 kilograms (3,360 pounds). The largest Tiger shark specimen was 7.3 metres (24 feet) and is a contender for the largest carnivorous fish alongside the great white shark.The Tiger sharks skin can typically range from a blue or green hue to light with a white or light yellow underbelly. The distinguishing dark spots and stripes are most outstanding in young sharks and fade as the shark matures.The Tiger sharks head is somewhat wedge-shaped, which makes it easy for the shark to turn quickly to one side. Tiger sharks, as with other sharks, have small pits on the side of their upper bodies which hold electrical sensors called the \u2018ampullae of lorenzini\u2019, enabling them to detect small muscle movements of other creatures, allowing them to hunt in darkness. In addition, the Tiger shark, like many other sharks, has a mirror-like covering behind their retina called \u2018tapetum lucidum\u2019 that is exposed in darkness to reflect light that has already been seen by the retina back at it as to allow the shark to see better. A Tiger shark generally has long fins and a long upper tail. The long fins act like wings and provide lift as the shark manoeuvres through water, whereas the long tail provides bursts of speed. A Tiger shark normally swims using nimble movements of its body. Its high back and dorsal fin act as a pivot, allowing it to spin quickly.The Tiger sharks teeth are flat, triangular, notched and serrated. Like most sharks, when a tiger shark loses or breaks one of its teeth, it grows a replacement tooth. The distinctive teeth seem to have evolved to be able to cut through turtle shells and an adult Tiger shark can easily bite through bone.",
            "diet": "The Tiger shark is a solitary hunter, usually hunting at night. Its name is derived from the dark stripes down its body.The Tiger shark is a dangerous predator, known for eating a wide range of prey. Its usual diet consists of fish, seals, birds, smaller sharks, squid and turtles. It has sometimes been found with man-made waste such as license plates or pieces of old tires in its digestive tract. The Tiger shark is notorious for attacks on swimmers, divers and surfers in Hawaii and is often referred to as the \u2018bane of Hawaiian surfers\u2019 and \u2018the wastebasket of the sea\u2019.",
            "behaviour": "The Tiger sharks behaviour is primarily nomadic (moving from one place to another, rather than settling down in one location), however, it is guided by warmer currents and it remains closer to the equator throughout the colder months. The Tiger shark tends to stay in deep waters that line reefs but does move into channels to pursue prey in shallower waters.The Tiger shark is known to be aggressive. The ability to pick up low-frequency pressure waves enables the shark to advance towards an animal with confidence, even in the environment of murky water where it is often found. The Tiger shark is known to circle its prey and even study it by prodding it with its snout. When attacking the shark devours all of its prey.The Tiger shark is second only to the Great White shark in number of recorded human fatalities and is considered, along with the great white, bull shark and the oceanic whitetip shark to be one of the sharks most dangerous to humans. It is often colloquially called the man-eater shark.",
            "reproduction": "Sexual maturity of the Tiger Shark is reached at different stages for the male and female. Males mature when they reach a length of 2.26 metres (7 feet) to 2.9 metres (10 feet) whereas females mature at 2.5 metres (8 feet) to 3.25 metres (11 feet). It has been estimated that the Tiger shark can swim at a maximum speed of around 32 kilometres per hour (20 miles per hour), with short bursts of higher speeds that last only a few seconds.The Tiger shark breeds by internal fertilization. It is the only species in its family that is ovoviviparous, like mammals, it gives birth to live young. Mating in the northern hemisphere will generally take place between the months of March and May, with the young being born around April or June the following year. In the southern hemisphere, mating takes place in November, December or early January.Young Tiger Sharks are nourished inside the mothers body for up to 14 to 16 months, where the female can produce a litter ranging from 10 to 80 young. A newborn tiger shark is generally 51 centimetres (20 inches) to 76 centimetres (30 inches) long and leaves its mother upon birth. It is unknown how long Tiger sharks live, but it has been speculated to be 20 years.",
            "s and humans": "Although shark attacks on humans are a relatively rare phenomenon, the Tiger shark is responsible for a large percentage of the fatal attacks that do occur on humans and is regarded as one of the most dangerous species of sharks. Tiger sharks reside in temperate and tropical waters. They are often found in river estuaries and harbours, as well as shallow water close to shore, where they are bound to come into contact with humans. Because of their curious nature of feeding it is expected that a Tiger shark would normally attack a human if it came in contact with it. Tiger sharks are known to dwell in waters with runoff, such as where a river enters the ocean.Tiger sharks have become a recurring problem in Hawaii and are considered the most dangerous shark species in Hawaiian waters. They are considered to be sacred \u2018aumakua\u2019 or ancestor spirits by the native Hawaiians, however between 1959 and 1976, 4,668 Tiger sharks were hunted down in an effort to control what was proving to be detrimental to the tourism industry. Despite these numbers, little decrease was ever detected in the attacks on humans. It is illegal to feed sharks in Hawaii and any interaction with them such as cage diving is discouraged.",
            "conservation status": "Tiger Sharks are classed as \u2018Near Threatened\u2019. While the Tiger shark is not directly commercially fished, it is caught for its fins, flesh and liver which is a valuable source of vitamin A used in the production of vitamin oils."

Toco Toucans are typically seen in pairs or small family-groups. In flight it alternates between a burst of rapid flaps with the relatively short, rounded wings and gliding. Nesting is seasonal, but timing differs between regions. The nest is typically placed high in a tree and consists of a cavity, at least part of which is excavated by the parent birds themselves. It has also been recorded nesting in holes in earth-banks and terrestrial termite-nests.Toco Toucans often gather in large groups and chatter loudly and noisily, their calls being synchronized with the fast upward swings of their beaks.",

Tortoises are found worldwide with the most famous tortoise of all, the Giant Tortoise Lonesome George who lives on the Galapagos Islands near Ecuador. Tortoises, like their aquatic cousins, the Turtles, have a hard shell which protects their body. The top shell is called the carapace (a dorsal section of an exoskeleton or shell) and the bottom is called the plastron (the nearly flat part of the shell structure). The carapace and the plastron are connected by what is called the \u2018bridge\u2019. The shell is covered with scutes which are scales that are made of keratin (the same protein that our fingernails are made of). The carapace can help indicate the age of the tortoise by the number of concentric rings, much like the cross-section of a tree.",

The Trapdoor Spider is a common name for any of several large, hairy, harmless tropical spiders that nest underground. Trapdoor spiders make up the family Ctenizidae of the order Araneae. The species is common in the southwestern United States. Trapdoor spiders are often kept as exotic pets, however, Trapdoor Spiders are very aggressive and should only be kept by experienced people.",
            "characteristics": "A Trapdoor spider can be around 2.5 centimetres long on average, however, they can reach a length of 4 centimetres. Trapdoor spiders have 8 eyes, a pair in the middle and 3 on each side. Their colors range from yellowish brown to reddish brown to black.They have powerful jaws and sharp fangs, that stab downwards into its prey. Trapdoor spiders have 8 legs that are thick and short, 2 fangs and 2 body parts which are the abdomen and the thorax.Trapdoor spiders are usually stocky spiders in appearance. Their bodies are thinly covered with hairs. A Trapdoor spider can run very fast.",
            "habitat and webs": "A Trapdoor spider lives under ground for most of its life. You can find Trapdoor spiders in Japan, Africa, South America and North America and many other warm places.A Trapdoor spider does not have a web like other spiders do. It has a trapdoor on top of a burrow. A Trapdoor spiders burrow is around 30 centimetres deep and 5 centimetres across. Sometimes they like to make their burrows beside creeks or rivers so they can catch little fish.Trapdoor spider colony \u2013 Image sourceThe trapdoor that these spiders construct is difficult to see when it is closed because of the plant and soil materials that effectively camouflage it. The trapdoor is hinged on one side with silk.The spiders, who are usually nocturnal, typically wait for prey while holding onto the underside of the door with the claws on their tarsi (the cluster of bones in the foot between the tibia and fibula and the metatarsus).Prey is captured when insects or other arthropods venture too close to the half-open trapdoor at night. The spider detects the prey by vibrations and when it comes close enough, the spider jumps out of its burrow and captures it. Female Trapdoor spiders never travel far from their burrows.A Trapdoor spiders enemies include wasps, scorpions and people. If a wasp finds the burrow it will quickly run into the spiders burrow and sting the spider. The only way to save itself is for the spider to hold the door with its fangs.The wasp usually wins, because it cuts the lid of the burrow with its sharp fangs. When they have stung the spider the wasps lay their eggs (usually one per spider) on its body. Other predators of Trapdoor Spiders can include birds, bandicoots, centipedes, scorpions, parasitic wasps and flies.Brown Trapdoor spider burrows are open (without a trapdoor). Often they are found scattered over lawns.Brown Trapdoor SpiderThey can be distinguished from Funnel-web spider burrows by the absence of silk trip lines around the entrance. Sigillate Trapdoor spider burrows are made with soil or litter trapdoors.",

            "reproduction": "Mature male Trapdoor Spiders wander during humid weather in search of a mate. Mating takes place within the females burrow. The male usually escapes being eaten in order to mate with several females, before dying.The female Trapdoor spider will lay her eggs several months after mating and protects them within her burrow. When the spiderlings have hatched, they remain for several months before dispersing on the ground. They will then make their own miniature burrows.Each time the spider grows bigger, it has to widen its burrow and in the door-building species, add another rim to the door. In undamaged trapdoors, yearly concentric (having a common centre, as circles or spheres) rings can be seen.Trapdoor Spiders have a long life span, between 5 to 20 years and take several years to reach maturity. Female Trapdoor spiders stay in or near their burrows, whereas males leave their burrows once mature and go in search of a mate.",

            "desc": "The Tuatara is a reptile of the family Sphenodontidae, endemic to New Zealand. The two species of tuatara are the only surviving members of the Sphenodontians who flourished around 200 million years ago. The tuataras resemble lizards, but are equally related to lizards and snakes, which are their closest living relatives. For this reason, tuataras are of great interest in the study of the evolution of lizards and snakes and for the reconstruction of the appearance and habits of the earliest diapsids (the group that additionally includes birds and crocodiles). Tuataras have been referred to as living fossils. This means that they have remained mostly unchanged throughout their entire history, which is approximately 200 million years.",
            "characteristics": "The tuatara is considered the most unspecialised living amniote; the brain and mode of locomotion resemble that of amphibians and the heart is more primitive than any other reptile. Adults are about 50 centimetres (20 inches) long and weigh between 0.5 and 1 kilogram (1.1 \u2013 2.2 pounds).Tuataras display sexual dimorphism, as the males are larger, weighing up to 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds), almost twice the weight of the females. The spiny crest on their back, made of triangular soft folds of skin, is bigger in males than in females and can be stiffened for display. The male abdomen is narrower than the females.The tuataras color ranges from olive green to brown to orange-red and it can change color over its lifetime. It sheds its skin at least once per year, usually 3 or 4 times as juveniles.The tip of the upper jaw is beak-like and separated from the remainder of the jaw by a notch. There is a single row of teeth in the lower jaw and a double row in the upper jaw, with the bottom row fitting perfectly between the two upper rows when the mouth is closed. This is a tooth arrangement not seen in any other reptiles; although most snakes also have a double row of teeth in their upper jaw, their arrangement and function is different from the tuatara\u2019s.As their teeth wear down, older tuataras have to switch to softer prey such as earthworms, larvae and slugs and eventually have to chew their food between smooth jaw bones.In tuataras, both eyes can focus independently and are specialized with a \u2018duplex retina\u2019 that contains two types of visual cells for vision by both day and night and a tapetum lucidum which reflects on to the retina to enhance vision at night. There is also a third eyelid on each eye, the nictitating membrane.The tuatara has a third eye on the top of its head called the \u2018parietal eye\u2019. It has its own lens, cornea, retina with rod-like structures and degenerated nerve connection to the brain, suggesting it evolved from a real eye. The parietal eye is only visible in hatchlings, which have a translucent patch at the top centre of the skull. After four to six months it becomes covered with opaque scales and pigment. Its purpose is unknown, but it may be useful in absorbing ultraviolet rays to manufacture vitamin D, as well as to determine light/dark cycles and help with thermoregulation. Of all extant tetrapods, the parietal eye is most pronounced in the tuatara. In mammals, it has become the pineal gland.Together with turtles, the tuatara has the most primitive hearing organs among the amniotes. There is no eardrum and the middle ear cavity is filled with loose tissue, mostly adipose tissue. Tuataras respond only to low frequencies.",
            "behaviour": "Adult tuataras are terrestrial and nocturnal reptiles, though they will often bask in the sun to warm their bodies. Hatchlings hide under logs and stones and are diurnal, likely because adults are cannibalistic. Tuataras survive in temperatures much lower than those tolerated by most reptiles and hibernate during winter.",
            "reproduction": "Tuataras reproduce very slowly, sometimes taking ten years to reach sexual maturity. Mating occurs in midsummer when females mate and lay eggs once every four years. During courtship, a male makes his skin darker, raises his crests and parades toward the female. He circles himself around the female while slowly walking with stiffened legs. The female will either submit and allow the male to mate with her or retreat to her burrow. Males do not have a penis, instead they reproduce by lifting the tail of the female and placing his vent over hers. The sperm is then transferred into the female.Tuatara eggs have a soft, parchment-like shell. It takes the females between one and three years to provide eggs with yolk and up to seven months to form the shell. It then takes between 12 and 15 months from mating to hatching. This means reproduction occurs at 2 to 5 year intervals, the slowest in any reptile. The sex of a hatchling depends on the temperature of the egg, with warmer eggs tending to produce male tuataras and cooler eggs producing females. Eggs incubated at 21\u00b0 C have an equal chance of being male or female. However, at 22\u00b0 C, 80% are likely to be males and at 20\u00b0 C, 80% are likely to be females; at 18\u00b0 C all hatchlings will be females.",
            "life span": "Tuataras probably have the slowest growth rates of any reptile, continuing to grow larger for the first 35 years of their lives. The average life span is about 60 years, however, they can live to be over 100 years old.",
            "conservation status": "The tuatara has been classified as an endangered species since 1895. Tuataras, like many of New Zealand\u2019s native animals, are threatened by habitat loss and introduced species, such as mustelids (weasel family) and rats. Tuataras were extinct on the mainland, with the remaining populations confined to 32 offshore islands, until the first mainland release into the heavily fenced and monitored Karori Wildlife Sanctuary in 2005."

These taxa are often considered to be the same species, but are sometimes split into two species: Bewick\u2019s swan (Cygnus bewickii) and the whistling swan (C. columbianus). Bewick\u2019s swan is found in the Palearctic, across much of Eurasia and North Africa. The whistling swan is found in the Nearctic, in North America. The tundra swan is the smallest of the Holarctic swans and most of their body, including their neck, is white. Their diet mainly consists of aquatic vegetation, but they\u2019ll also eat grains and crops.",
            "lifespan": "The lifespan of tundra swans is between 15 and 20 years in the wild. In captivity, however, their lifespan is longer, between 20 and 25 years.They are more likely to die in the first three years of life, with their annual mortality rate is 25 to 50% during this time. During and after their third year, their annual mortality rate is 10 to 15%.The most common causes of death in the adult tundra swan is lead poisoning, avian cholera, hunting, drowning and starvation.",
            "diet": "Tundra swans are herbivores. In the summer, they mostly consume aquatic vegetation, such as grasses (mannagrass and seagrass), sieges and smartweed. They will also eat flowers, stems, roots, and tubers.The rest of the year, they eat leftover grains and other crops such as potatoes, which are foraged in open fields after harvest. These swans will occasionally feed on some invertebrates such as shellfish, too.The tundra swan forages mainly in the day and does so by dipping their heads underwater, and stretching out their long necks to obtain food up to 1 m under the surface. They use their sharp beaks to dig up plants by their roots, or tear plants out of the ground using their webbed feet as paddles.",
            "behavior": "Tundra swans are mostly active during the day. They are social and interact with other swans within their population, but are closest in family units. A family unit will usually consist of both parents, their 3 to 7 cygnets from that year, and occasionally young from previous years.Swans are socially dominant. In large flocks made up of multiple swan families, the most dominant family is not necessarily the largest unit, but is determined by each member\u2019s ability to gain resources.Swan units with more dominance have greater access to food and resting areas. Once dominance is established for a family, their social rank is maintained throughout the winter.Male tundra swans will often fight other males, particularly when it comes to protecting their families. Unmated birds are much lower down the social rank and so are unlikely to engage in aggressive encounters. However, an unmated bird can establish dominance, and their social rank increases with their years in the flock.",
            "communication": "Tundra swans use calls to communicate with other flock members. They are particularly vocal when foraging in flocks on their wintering grounds.These calls are a high-pitched honking which sounds like,\u201cwoo-oh\u201d or a \u201ckow-hooo\u201d.",
            "migration": "Tundra swans are a migratory species. Migrating flocks can be made up of 100 swans or more, and are made up of family groups.They leave the nesting areas in late summer and concentrate in nearby estuaries, before southward migration begins in mid-autumn.Bewick\u2019s swan start to arrive on the breeding grounds around mid-May, and leave for winter quarters around the end of September. Whistling swans arrive at their breeding grounds in late-May and leave for winter quarters about October.",
            "reproduction": "Tundra swans breed yearly, in late May through late June. They are a monogamous species and are not known to change mates within their lifetime, with both parents helping to raise their young.When courting, the swans face each other, then quiver, spread their wings, and call out loudly. While calling, they bow their heads up and down to express interest.The reproductive success of a tundra swan can help establish dominance in the social structure. The greater the number of young from the previous year that are paired with a mate upon their arrival at their wintering site, the greater their dominance within groups of family units.During the mating season, nests with a diameter of between 122 to 183 cm and a depth of 61 cm are built, made of moss, dead leaves, and grasses.The warmer the temperature at the breeding site, the more eggs that are produced, although the average is between 3 and 7 eggs. Eggs are laid one at a time, every 1.5 to 2 days, and are creamy white, smooth and circular in shape. They usually measure about 107 mm by 66 mm.The incubation period ranges from 31 to 33 days, with the female doing most of the incubating. When the female is absent, the male sits on the eggs. They have a precise mechanism of changeover.The parent swan that is leaving the eggs stands and pokes downwards at the eggs a few times, and then walks off.Then, the parent that is returning to the nest quickly sits on the eggs. Whichever parent is not sat on the eggs, sits nearby to watch for predators.When hatched, the hatchlings, called cygnets, are born fully feathered and weigh about 180 g. The downy young are silvery gray above and white below.Their eyes are opened, and they are able to leave their nests immediately. However, they cannot fly until they are between 60 to 75 days old.Once the eggs have hatched, the parental roles are not distinct and both parents look after the cygnets equally.However, cygnets follow their mother, keep closer to her, and interact with her more than the father. Both parents tend to stay close to each other and their offspring during the pre-fledging period.Cygnets do not leave their parents until they are at least 2 years of age. They are able to reproduce by the age of 3, but may not begin breeding until the age of 4 or 5. Sometimes siblings rejoin their family, with or without a mate.Immature tundra swans are grayish but, in their second winter, they moult into the adult plumage. Young swans have pinkish-gray legs, which turn a dull black as they get older. Their beak is also pinkish-gray and turns pure black with age.Tundra Swan Location and HabitatTundra swans are widespread and native to parts of North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. Bewick\u2019s swan is found across much of Eurasia and North Africa, while the whistling swan is found across North America.As their name suggests, tundra swans breed in the tundra of the Arctic and subarctic, where they inhabit shallow pools, lakes and rivers.Tundra swans are a migratory species. The whistling swan consists of two populations: the western population and the eastern population.During the summer breeding season, the western population inhabits the southwestern coast of Alaska, from Point Hope to the Aleutian Islands, and above the Arctic circle of Canada. During the wintering season, they migrate towards the Arctic slope of Alaska to the California Central Valley.The eastern population inhabits the Pacific Ocean during the summer breeding season and then migrates southward through Canada, and into the Great Lakes region of North America. During the wintering season, they inhabit Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.Bewick\u2019s swans travel from their breeding grounds across the coastal lowlands of Siberia around the end of September, migrating via the White Sea, Baltic Sea and the estuary of the Elbe to winter in Denmark, the Netherlands and the British Isles.Some birds also winter elsewhere on the southern shores of the North Sea. Bewick\u2019s swans that breed in eastern Russia migrate via Mongolia and northern China to winter in the coastal regions of Korea, Japan, and southern China, south to Guangdong and occasionally as far as Taiwan.Tundra swans are mostly found in freshwater lakes, pools, grasslands, and marshes at an elevation below 60 m. They prefer to reside in aquatic habitats, such as wetlands close to agricultural fields, where there is plenty of food for them. During the migration period, they are found in rivers and lakes along their migratory pathway.While they fly, tundra swans have been observed as high as 8,229.6 m above ground.Tundra Swan Conservation StatusTundra swans are considered to be abundant across their range. The whistling swan is the most common swan species of North America, and, although less is known about Bewick\u2019s swan populations, it is also thought they are fairly common across their range.Despite this, the tundra swan population is declining. This is due to habitat destruction and water pollution, which affects their food sources both in the summer and winter.The main cause of death in the tundra swan is hunting, with at least 10,000 tundra swans being killed each year. The United States allows hunting of tundra swans in eight states.Despite it being illegal to hunt Bewick\u2019s swan, they are often found with lead shots in their body.The IUCN lists the tundra swan as Least Concern.",
            "predators": "Tundra swans have very few natural predators. The main threat is to breeding females and hatchlings, which can be preyed on by Arctic foxes, brown bears, red foxes, golden eagles and parasitic jaegers.Tundra swans spend their time in flocks to avoid predation. The larger the flock, the more swans there are to look out for predators and the safer the swans are.During the breeding season, the males keep a look out for predators to protect the females and the young.Tundra swans have a heightened sense of vision and hearing, which are helpful in avoiding predation. This also helps them keep aware of other flock members, and scan for food.",
            "importance": "Tundra swans are important to their environment as they help to spread plants as they migrate. For example, they use the pondweed as a food source during migration, and then disperse the pondweed, causing its population to expand.Tundra swan feathers are often used by humans for coats, pillows, blankets, mattresses, and winter clothing. Their excrement can also be used as a fertilizer to help with crop and grass growth.Tundra Swan FAQsWhere do tundra swans live?Tundra swans are widespread in the Northern Hemisphere and can be found in North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. They are mostly found in freshwater lakes, pools, grasslands, and marshes, where there is plenty of food for them to eat.Do tundra swans migrate?Tundra swans do migrate. As a migratory species, they leave the nesting areas in late summer and begin their southward migration in mid-autumn. When migrating, they congregate in large flocks. Tundra swans with breeding grounds in different parts of the world also migrate to different parts of the world.Is there more than one species of tundra swan?This is up for debate. Some believe there is only one species of tundra swan, with two taxa, but others believe the two taxa are separate species. These species are known as Bewick\u2019s swan (Cygnus bewickii) and the whistling swan (C. columbianus). They are located in different parts of the world and even look slightly different, but are similar enough to belong to the same genus.Are tundra swans white?Tundra swans are almost entirely white. Their whole plumage, including their neck, is white. In fact, the only parts of their body that are not white are their legs and feet, their bills and their eyes!Young tundra swans are grey, but molt and develop their white plumage as they age."

Most tundra wolves have a grey color, with mixes of black, rust and silver grey. Like most canids, Tundra wolves have a high body, long legs, broad skull tapering to a narrow muzzle. Their tail is bushy and their coat has a thick, dense underfur.\u00a0",

The shell is covered with scutes, scales that are made of keratin (the same protein that our fingernails are made of and the horn of a rhino). The Order Testudines includes both extant (living) and extinct species, the earliest turtles being known from around 250 million years ago, making turtles one of the oldest reptile groups and a much more ancient group than the lizards and snakes. About 300 species are alive today. Some are highly endangered. Turtles, like other reptiles, are ectothermic or cold-blooded, which means that their body temperature changes with their surroundings."

            "desc": "Vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) are bats that feed on blood. This particular habit in certain animals is known as \u2018hematophagy\u2019. There are only three bat species that actually feed on blood: The Common Vampire Bat (Desmodus rotundus), the Hairy-legged Vampire Bat (Diphylla ecaudata) and the White-winged Vampire Bat (Diaemus youngi). All three species are native to the Rainforests of America, ranging from Mexico to Brazil, Chile, and Argentina. Vampire bats very rarely bite people because they apparently dislike human blood. The three species of Bats are quite different from each other and are therefore placed within different genera (no other species are currently classified in any of the three genera concerned). But they are related.",
            "rainforest bat diet": "Vampire Bats only come out to feed when it is fully dark. Like fruit-eating bats and unlike insectivorous and fish-eating bats, they only emit low-energy sound pulses. The Common Vampire Bat feeds mostly on the blood of mammals, whereas the Hairy-legged Vampire Bat, and the White-winged Vampire Bat feed on the blood of birds.Using their sharp teeth, the bats make tiny cuts in the skin of a sleeping animal. The bats\u2019 saliva contains a chemical that keeps the blood from clotting. The bats then lap up the blood that oozes from the wound. Another chemical in their saliva numbs the animal\u2019s skin and keeps them from waking up.Vampire bats do not kill their prey. They only take about a teaspoon or two of blood at a feeding. Since bats rarely carry rabies, there is little chance their victims will die from that disease. However, it has been said that some do carry the disease and it is not the blood-sucking that kills the victim, but the transfer of the rabies. I guess it depends upon species and whether that species has contracted the disease.When the bats have finished their meal, they are often so engorged with blood that they are too heavy to fly, so they have to retire in a place away from the victims to digest their meal before taking flight.A vampire bat finds its prey with echolocation (use of ultra-high frequency sounds for navigation), smell, and sound. They fly about one metre above the ground. Then they use special heat sensors in their noses to find veins that are close to the skin.Once the common vampire bat locates a host, usually a sleeping mammal, they land and approach it on the ground. A recent study found that common vampire bats can, in addition to walking, run at speeds of up to 1.2 metres per second. Vampire bats locate a suitable place to bite their victims using their infrared sensors.The feeding pattern of the vampire bat adds a layer of complexity to its anatomy. Because they often do not find host organisms for many hours and may have to fly a long distance to do so, vampire bats usually feed in enormous quantities. This influx of proteins can however make the bat too heavy to fly. Vampire bats have so much stealth that they can drink for 30 minutes without awakening the animal. If vampire bats do not get blood for two days, they will eventually die, but that is less likely to happen. Female bats are generous and will give their blood to other bats who lack food.Apparently, the bats urinary system accommodates this by releasing dilute urine consisting of a lot of water and fewer solutes. However, when the bat is resting, a new problem is faced. The large amounts of protein create excess urea and must be disposed of. The urinary system of the vampire bat then uses various hormones to make concentrated urine which consists of more urea and less water.",
            "rainforest bat habitats": "Vampire bats tend to live in almost completely dark places, such as caves, old wells, hollow trees and buildings. Colonies can range from a single individual to thousands. Vampire bats often roost with other species of bat.",
            "rainforest bat reproduction": "Common vampire bats will almost always have only one offspring per breeding season. Each colony will typically contain only one reproducing male, with around twenty females and their offspring. Vampire bats need blood at least once every few days to survive. If they cannot get blood, they will approach another vampire bat whilst roosting, asking for a blood \u2018transfusion\u2019. The blood is exchanged mouth-to-mouth in a motion that looks very much like kissing. Their babies use tiny thumbs in the middle of the wing to cling on the mothers furry belly.",

Not really, here are some facts:Bats are not blind. Most bats can see as well as humans. Fruit bats have eyesight that is adapted to low-light, much like cats. Fruit bats also see in color.Vampires have not always been associated with bats, although both were considered mysterious and somewhat supernatural. Bram Stroker\u2019s \u201cDracula\u201d was the first known connection. Stoker had seen a newspaper article on the bats and decided to include it in his book.Bats are not flying mice. They are not even remotely related to rodents. Bats are such unique animals that scientists have placed them in a group all their own, called \u2018Chiroptera\u2019, which means hand-wing. Bats are grouped with primates and lemurs in an order called Archonta.Bats are shy, gentle, and intelligent and they are among the slowest reproducing animals on earth.Vampire Bats are the only known mammals that exist entirely on a diet of blood. Their preferred prey are large birds, horses, cows and pigs.Perhaps as a result of being so misunderstood, Vampire Bats and many other bat species are at risk of extinction.Fears about vampire bats are fueled by a lot of misconceptions. A common one is that the bats bite the throats of their human victims. This is very far from the truth!"

            "diet, hunting and feeding": "Vultures are carnivores and scavengers and feed mainly on carrion of freshly killed animals. Flocks of Vultures can be observed soaring over the Savannas, searching for carcasses and sometimes following ungulates as they undertake their regular migrations. Vultures will also eat scraps from human habitats.Most birds of prey will feed on live prey, however, Vultures are specialized \u2018eaters of the dead\u2019. It is not an uncommon sight to see a group of different species of Vulture feeding on a dead animal at the same time.On a huge carcass, such as a dead elephant, hundreds, sometimes a thousand Vultures can be seen sqabbling over the kill, making grunts and goose-like hisses and cackles. The scrum of vultures can be seen dipping their long, bare necks under the skin of the carcass or crawling into the ribcage as they feed on the dead remains.After gorging themselves, the vultures may bathe together with other species at a favourite site, or rest with their wings spread and backs to the sun. Despite their ghastly habits, vultures are one of the fussiest birds when it comes to cleanliness.Vultures can eat as well as digest meat, in any stage of decay and can even endure diseases that would kill any other animal. Vulture stomach acid is exceptionally corrosive, allowing them to safely digest putrid carcasses infected with Botulinum toxin, hog cholera, and anthrax bacteria that would be lethal to other scavengers. This also enables them to use their reeking, corrosive vomit as a defense when threatened.If a dead animal has a very thick hide which the vulture cannot get into, it waits for a larger scavenger to eat first. Vultures are known to strip meat, skin and even feathers, leaving only the skeleton of the animal remaining, however, some vultures will also eat bones, along with the other parts of an animal.Vultures seldom attack healthy animals, however, they may kill a wounded or sick animal.",

Vultures can fly for a very long time, without becoming tired, as they glide on the thermal updrafts which gives them a \u2018free lift\u2019. They fly in circular motions in order to gain height.Vultures have a unique way of cooling themselves in the African heat by urinating. This not only cools them, but disinfects their legs which kills any germs they may have picked up walking through the carcasses.The main predators of the Vultures are Hawks, Snakes and Wild cats.

Smaller species tend to be nocturnal, or mostly active at night. Smaller species are often solitary, while larger species often live or feed in groups of up to 50 animals called mobs. A few species are thought to be territorial. They live alone and defend their home area.",
            "reproduction": "Breeding season for most wallabies is between January and February. After a gestation period of 28 days, a single joey is born. Like most marsupials, young wallabies (joeys) are born very small, undeveloped and vulnerable. As soon as they are born, they crawl into their mothers pouch where they remain for at least 2 months and continue to develop over the next 7 months.Even after leaving their mothers pouch, joeys will return if they are posed with danger. If the female wallaby becomes pregnant again while the joey is still in her pouch, the embryos development will pause until the joey leaves the pouch, a phenomenon called embryonic diapause. The life span of a wallaby is around 9 years in the wild.Wallaby Conservation StatusFour species in this family have already gone extinct. Many others are Endangered, which means that they face a very high risk of extinction in the wild. Others are considered Vulnerable, which means that they face a high risk of extinction in the wild.

They are characterized mostly by the two pairs of tusks protruding from the mouth and curving upwards, which are used for digging, fighting and in defence against predators. Unfortunately, these tusks are also commonly taken for the tourist trade in east and southern Africa. Unlike other pig species, the warthog has adapted to grazing and savanna habitats, and its diet is omnivorous.

They are omnivores and their diet consists of grasses, roots, berries and other fruits, bark, fungi, insects, eggs and carrion, although their diet will vary depending on the season and what is available. During the dry season, they eat rhizomes and bulbs, which may provide water for common warthogs during periods of drought.They also eat their own dung, and the dung of rhinoceroses, African buffalos, waterbucks, and francolins!To search for food, they use their snout and feet. They are specialized for grazing short grasses by being able to lower themselves close to the ground on their wrist joints, which are calloused and padded.",
            "behavior": "Warthogs live in social groups called sounders, which can contain up to 18 individuals. Females live in sounders with their young and with other females, while males leave their natal group at around two years old but stay in their home range. Females will only leave sounders when they are pregnant. Subadult males associate in bachelor groups, but live alone when they become adults. They will join sounders around breeding times to mate with females.These animals are not territorial and different warthogs often have overlapping home ranges. They share resting, feeding, drinking, and wallowing sites. They are primarily diurnal and take refuge at night in burrows, but will change this if there is human disturbance and will forage at night instead.Warthogs have a mutualistic relationship with birds, such as red-billed and yellow-billed oxpeckers. The birds are able to feed on the parasites carried by common warthogs while the beasts are able to rid themselves of these pests. They have also been observed allowing banded mongooses and vervet monkeys to groom them to remove ticks.Warthogs have poor eyesight but their hearing and sense of smell are very good. They have two facial glands: the tusk gland and the sebaceous gland, which they will start to use around six to seven months old. They will rub their preorbital glands against each other during friendly encounters.Warthogs rarely fight and are much more likely to flee from predators than face them. They can run at speeds of up to 48 km/h (30 mph), and will run with their tails sticking up and will enter their dens rear first with tusks facing out. However, they will fight with other males during the mating season. Occasionally, they have been observed charging and even wounding large predators. During fights, they grunt and grind their teeth.Mothers are very protective of their piglets, which are often preyed on by birds of prey such as Verreaux\u2019s eagle owls and martial eagles. She will defend them aggressively.",
            "reproduction": "Warthogs have a polygynandrous mating system and both males and females have many mates. While males do not defend their territories, they will fight with other males for breeding rights with females. Fighting includes pushing and striking with the head and blunt upper tusks. Males are usually solitary animals, but will join sounders to mate with females. Female warthogs use frequent urination to demonstrate their readiness for mating to boars.Females usually become fertile 4 to 5 months after the rainy season has ended and give birth during the dry season. Once pregnant, a female will leave her sounder and give birth in a burrow, which is important in regulating the body temperature of the piglets, since young warthogs can not maintain their own body temperature the first few days of life.They have the longest gestation period of all pigs, ranging from 170 to 175 days and give birth to litter sizes of between 1 to 7 piglets, with an average of 3 piglets per litter. The young warthogs spend six to seven weeks in the burrow before venturing out with their mother. Mothers have been observed to nurse foster piglets if they lose their own litter. Adult males do not play a role in parental care.Piglets begin grazing at about two to three weeks of age and are weaned by six months. They are quick mobile stay close to their mothers for defense. Male warthogs do not leave their mother until they are 2 years of age. They are sexually mature at 18 to 20 months, although males do not typically mate until 4 years of age.\u00a0Warthog Location and HabitatWarthogs are found in Africa, but the exact location depends on the species. The Nolan variant is found in Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Chad, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal and Sudan. The Eritrean warthog is found in Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Somalia and the Central African warthog is found in Kenya and Tanzania. The Southern variant is found in Angola, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe.They usually reside in open and wooded savannas, grass-steppes, and semi-deserts. They tend to prefer open areas and avoid rainforest and severe desert, and will sometimes use formerly wooded areas that have been cleared for pastures.Warthogs will not live where there is human activity. They need areas where they can cool-off in order to cope with high temperatures, such as wallows. They also require areas in which to stay warm in the evening, such as burrows. Often these dens are made by aardvarks. They don\u2019t fight for the holes, though. Warthogs are generally passive and look for already abandoned dens to make their homes.Conservation StatusWarthogs are widespread in their home range and as of 1999, the population in southern Africa is estimated to be about 250,000. They are listed as Least Concern by the IUCN Red List.However, many populations are in serious decline due to overhunting in unprotected areas. Wildlife reserves are trying to protect warthogs, but outside of these areas there are no regulations on hunting. They are easy to hunt and are valued for their meat, both for local consumption and trade in cities. They are also killed for their tusks, from which warthog ivory is taken. They are carved predominantly for the tourist trade in east and southern Africa.Warthogs are known to cause damage to various crops, such as rice-fields and peanut crops. Cattle ranchers also see warthogs as competitors for grazing in southern Africa. They are also susceptible to diseases which may be transmitted to domestic pigs, such as the tick-borne African swine fever virus. For these reasons, they may be unlawfully killed in the wild by farmers.",
            "predators": "Warthogs are predominantly preyed on by lions, but are also often preyed on by cheetahs, leopards, painted dogs, hyenas, and eagles. They avoid nocturnal predators by being active during the day and sheltering in burrows at night. They also use the warning calls of red-billed and yellow-billed oxpeckers to avoid predators. They are fast runners and usually avoid any attacks by fleeing, although can fight when needed.",

Less familiar, the suborder Symphyta includes the sawflies and wood wasps, which differ from the Apocrita by having a broad connection between the thorax and abdomen. Wasps come in several species and some of these measure up to 30 millimetres in length. There are two types of wasps:  ",
            "wasp nests": "Wasps are common throughout Britain. Wasps are social insects forming colonies inside nests specially constructed in soil, barks, roof spaces and in cavities in trees and walls. Wasps are frequently found in domestic housing. Wasps are social insects with a Queen, who is much larger than the workers and starts a new nest each year. Nests are constructed of wasp paper made by chewing wood and other plant debris mixed with saliva.Unlike honeybees, wasps have no wax producing gland. They manufacture a paper-like material from wood pulp. Wood fibres are gathered from weathered wood, softened by chewing and mixing with saliva. The paper is then used to make combs with cells for brood rearing.The fertilised queen wasp emerges from hibernation around mid-April and searches for a suitable site for a nest. The Queen rears the first brood of worker wasps by herself and upon hatching these workers will carry on the building of the nest. The Queen, the only wasp able to lay eggs, will remain in the nest laying more eggs for further broods.The more workers there are, the quicker the nest will grow. By late summer the normal wasp nests will contain from 3,000 to 5,000 individuals and be up to 30 centimetres across. With cooler weather, the workers and mates may become tired and aggressive towards anyone interfering with them. The cold winter weather kills off all the workers and males \u2013 only the queen survives.",
            "what to do if you discover a wasps nest!": "Although wasps are troublesome to us it would be unwise to destroy nests without good reason. Wasps are controllers of far more injurious pests of forestry, agriculture and gardens. If the presence of a wasp nest is causing no direct problems, then it is best left well alone. Wasp nests are abandoned at the end of the autumn. Should it be necessary to carry out a treatment the nest can be treated by either:-a) Dusting an insecticide powder around the entrance of the nest, preferably using injection tubes, which contaminates the workers as they return thereby carrying the dust inside; orb) Surface spraying an insecticide directly onto the nest. Do not use domestic aerosols. Destruction of a wasps nest should NOT be undertaken by untrained persons. If wasps are causing a problem it is advisable to contact the Environmental Health Department.\u00a0"

The few marine species tend to live in the intertidal zone (also known as the \u2018littoral zone\u2019, in marine aquatic environments it is the area of the foreshore and seabed that is exposed to the air at low tide and submerged at high tide). Many water beetles carry an air bubble underneath their abdomens. This air bubble provides both an air supply and prevents water from getting into the spiracles (small openings on the surface of some animals that usually lead to respiratory systems). Other water beetles have the surface of their exoskeleton modified to form a plastron (a thin permanent layer of air around the body of some aquatic insects)."

            "desc": "The waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus) is an antelope of the genus Kobus and the family Bovidae, first described by Irish naturalist William Ogilby in 1833. It is a large species, between 177 and 235 cm (70 and 93 in) long and a height between 120 and 136 cm (47 and 54 in). There are thirteen subspecies of waterbuck, which are grouped under two varieties. The waterbuck resides in sub-Saharan Africa, in scrub and savanna areas along rivers, lakes, and valleys. These animals predominantly eat grasses, and exhibit great dependence on water, with no toleration of dehydration. They often form herds of between 6 to 30 individuals, made up of nursery herds with females and their offspring or bachelor herds. Waterbucks got their name from their heavy dependence on water as compared to other antelopes, and their ability to enter into water for defence. They are listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, but populations are on the decline due to poaching and human disturbance.",
            "lifespan": "The waterbuck has an average lifespan of around 18 years in the wild. In captivity, they have been known to live to up to 30 years old.\u00a0",
            "diet": "Waterbucks are herbivores and eat a variety of grasses, both medium and short in length. In fact, grasses make up between 70 to 95 percent of their diet, so waterbucks are predominantly a grazer. They have a great requirement for protein in their diet, but spend much less time eating leaves, small shoots, and fruits than other grazers.The waterbuck is heavily dependent on water, which is one of the reasons for its name. In the hot weather, it cannot tolerate dehydration and therefore always makes sure it is close to a water source.These animals mainly feed in the mornings and at night when it is cooler, and rest and ruminate the remainder of the hot day.\u00a0",
            "behavior": "The waterbuck is a sociable animal that lives in herds made up of six to thirty individuals, although the herd size tends to increase in the summer. These herds are usually either made up of nursery herds with females and their offspring, bachelor herds or territorial males.As soon as young males start developing horns, which happens at around seven to nine months of age, they are chased out of the herd by territorial bulls. These males then form bachelor herds and may roam in female home ranges.Males start exhibiting territorial behavior at around the age of 5, but are most dominant between the ages of 6 to 9. After the age of ten years, males lose their territorial nature and replaced by a younger bull, following which they recede to a small and unprotected area.They mark their territory with dung and urine, and use several kinds of display, including revealing the white patch on the throat and between the eye. While females very infrequently fight, fighting between males is common and can result in death.Females have no established rank order in their herds. Despite the fact many female herds are made up of nurseries, female waterbucks are most commonly found alone or in pairs, and it is believed that herds of waterbuck are random meetings of individual waterbucks.Waterbucks are silent animals, and to communicate use flehmen response for visual communication and alarm snorts for vocal communication.They are susceptible to a number of health issues, including ulcers, lungworm infections, foot-and-mouth disease, yellow fever, blue tongue, anthrax, brucellosis and kidney stones.\u00a0",
            "reproduction": "Near the equator, waterbuck breeding takes place throughout the year, with births at their peak in the rainy season. In the south of Sahara, however, the mating season lasts four months, but can extend for even longer periods in some areas. The defassa and common waterbucks can have bordering ranges, and when this happens, they often interbreed.The female is in estrus for a day or less, and the male checks whether the female is in estrus by sniffing her vulva and urine. If the female is not, she will fight off the male by biting him. When copulation occurs, it can occur more than ten times.When sexually excited, the skin of the waterbuck secretes a greasy substance with the odour of musk, giving it the name \u201cgreasy kob\u201d. The odor is so unpleasant that it repels any predators. The greasy substance also helps to waterproof the waterbuck for when they dive into the water.The gestation period of the waterbuck lasts seven to eight months, and females give birth to one calf. Being one of the heaviest antelopes, newborn waterbucks typically weigh 13.6 kg (30 lb), and they can stand on their feet within a half-hour of birth. Males tend to grow faster than females, and horns begin to form on males at 8 to 9 months old, which marks their separation from the females.After birth, calves are kept hidden for two to three weeks up to two months. They are weaned at around 8 months old. Females are very protective of their calves and will fight off any intruders.Waterbucks are slower in maturation than other antelopes, with males becoming sexually mature at around six years old. Females mature quicker, at around two to three years old, and may conceive their first child at two and a half years old.\u00a0Waterbuck Location and HabitatWaterbucks reside in sub-Saharan Africa, but the particular areas in which they live depend on the subspecies. Those in the ellipsiprymnus group are found throughout southeast Africa, while those in the defassa group are found in northeastern, central, and western Africa. While the waterbuck used to be rather widespread, their numbers have now decreased in most areas.Because waterbucks cannot tolerate dehydration, they reside very close to water sources. Their main habitats include savanna grasslands, gallery forests, and riverine woodlands. These areas do not just provide water, but also provide suitable food for them and areas to hide from predators.The size of a waterbuck\u2019s home range depends on the quality of the habitat, population, and the age and fitness of the waterbuck. Waterbuck that are in good health and are younger have the largest ranges. The home ranges of females may overlap.Females have home ranges stretching over 200 to 600 hectares, while territorial males hold territories of 4 to 146 hectares in size.Waterbuck Conservation StatusThe common waterbuck is listed as of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, while the defassa waterbuck is listed as Near Threatened.The biggest threats to the waterbuck are habitat loss and fragmentation, caused by human interference. As more and more land is used for road building, settlements and expanding agriculture, there is less and less land for the waterbuck to live on. Waterbucks are also hunted for sport in Africa.",
            "predators": "Aside from humans, the main predators of the waterbuck are hyenas, lions, leopards, hunting dogs, cheetahs and crocodiles. They may run for cover when alarmed, but males will also often attack predators.",
            "importance": "Waterbucks are important to the tourism industry in Africa. Although not one of the big five, they are still an animal to be spotted by tourists out in the wild. They are also found in zoos across the world.\u00a0Waterbuck FAQsWhat is the difference between the ellipsiprymnus waterbuck and the defassa waterbuck?There are two main differences between the two main subspecies of waterbuck \u2014 their coat color, and their location. The common waterbuck is found throughout southeast Africa, while those in the defassa group are found in northeastern, central, and western Africa. That being said, they can actually be found in areas together, in which interbreeding can take place.Their fur is different, too. While they both have a shaggy brown\u00ac-gray coat, the common waterbuck has a conspicuous white ring encircling a dark rump, while the defassa has wide white patches on either side of the rump.Aside from this, the two subspecies group look fairly similar and can be difficult to distinguish.How big are waterbuck?Waterbucks are quite large animals, measuring between 177 and 235 cm (70 and 93 in) in length and reaching a height of between 120 and 136 cm (47 and 54 in). They exhibit sexual dimorphism, with males being bigger and heavier than females. Males typically weigh 198 to 262 kg (437 to 578 lb) and females weigh 161 to 214 kg (355 to 472 lb).Do waterbuck spend a lot of time in water?Despite their name and their ability to spend time in water, it is actually thought the waterbuck doesn\u2019t like being in water all that much. They have the ability to secrete a greasy substance onto their coat, which helps to waterproof them. They will only really enter water if they are trying to get away from a predator.The main reason a waterbuck has the word \u201cwater\u201d in its name is its large dependance on drinking water to avoid dehydration. These animals are not well adapted to dehydration, despite living in a very hot climate, and therefore need to live very close to a water source to ensure they can access it at all times.\u00a0",
            "other antelope species": "Aside from the waterbuck, there are 90 other species of antelope, which make up a large amount of the 140 or so known species of the Bovidae family. About 25 species are rated by the IUCN as Endangered, with the main threats being habitat loss, competition with cattle for grazing, and trophy hunting.Common antelope species include the impala, blue duiker, proghorn, springbok, greater kudu, lesser kudu, addax, steenbok, hartebeest, bongo, suni and East African oryx.\u00a0"

Common weasels are found in central and western Europe and the Mediterranean region (but not the Mediterranean islands). Weasels also inhabit North Africa, Asia and North America, and were introduced to New Zealand. Weasels are widespread and common throughout England, Scotland and Wales but absent from Ireland, the Isle of Man and most smaller islands. Like the stoat, it is still persecuted by gamekeepers. Weasels look very similar to Stoats, the only noticeable difference being, that unlike stoats, weasels do not have a black tip to the tail.",
            "description": "Weasels vary in length, but generally, male weasels measure around 20 \u2013 22 centimetres long and have a tail length of 6.5 centimetres and female weasels measure around 15 \u2013 18 centimetres long and have a tail length of 4.5 centimetres. The average weasel weighs about 198 grams (7 ounces), however, males usually weigh up to 115 grams and females up to 59 grams.Weasels bodies and necks are shaped cylindrically, they are long and slender and they have short legs. Their long slender bodies enable them to follow their prey into burrows.Weasels have light brown fur on their backs and their underparts are creamy/white. The weasel is smaller than the stoat and lacks the small white patches under their chin and throat. In many weasel species, populations living at high latitudes moult to a white coat with black fur at the tip of the tail in winter. Weasels have sharp eyesight and excellent hearing.",
            "habitats": "Weasels have a wide range of habitats from grasslands, sand dunes, lowland forests to upland moors and even towns, anywhere where there is suitable food. Their nests are made of grass and leaves, usually in holes in a wall, or tree stumps.",
            "diet": "Weasels feed on small mammals and in former times were considered vermin since some species took poultry from farms, or rabbits from commercial warrens. Certain species of weasel and ferrets, have been reported to perform the mesmerizing weasel \u2018war dance\u2019, after fighting other animals, or acquiring food from competing creatures. In folklore at least, this dance is particularly associated with the stoat. Mice and voles make up 60% \u2013 80% of their diet, however, they also eat rats, frogs and birds. Their prey is killed with a sharp bite to the back of the neck. Prey is usually taken on the ground.Cats, owls, foxes and birds of prey will all try to kill weasels, although a weasel will fight hard to defend itself.",
            "behaviour": "The weasel may travel up to 2.5 kilometres on a hunting expedition. Weasels are good climbers and will often raid birds nests, taking the eggs and young. When ratting, its courage is even greater than the stoats.Female weasels are considerably smaller than males, however, both are small enough to pursue rats, mice and even field voles in their own tunnels. Weasels are crepuscular, active at twilight (dusk and dawn), and it must consume a quarter to a third of its body weight every day to survive.Each weasel has a territory of 4 \u2013 8 hectares (1 hectare is equal to 2 football pitches). Male territories are larger than females and they may overlap with one another. The size of the territory depends on the food supply; where there is plenty there is no need to hunt for food far and wide. The individual territories are marked with strong-smelling secretions from the anal scent glands.Females stay in their territory throughout the year, however, during the mating season, males may travel long distances outside their normal range to find a mate. Weasels do not make themselves any kind of permanent burrow, they usually use the tunnel or burrow of one of the animals they have eaten.",
            "reproduction": "Weasels breed between April and August, this is the only time males and females associate with each other. They produce 1 \u2013 2 litters per year which contain 4 \u2013 6 young each. Gestation period is around 5 weeks. The young of the first litter grow very fast, they are weaned at 4 weeks, at which time their eyes open and are able to hunt and kill at 5 \u2013 8 weeks. They often accompany their mother on hunting expeditions.Young weasels, born early in the year, are capable of breeding themselves during their first summer, unlike other British carnivores which do not breed until their second year.Stoats and Weasels are quite different in their reproductive habits, this is probably due to the short life that weasels lead, forcing them to produce offspring as quickly as possible. Unlike stoats, weasels have no delayed implantation. Weasels have a life span of up to 2 \u2013 3 years in the wild, up to 10 years in captivity.",
            "conservation status": "Neither the stoat or weasel is in any real danger of extinction in the UK, they are however threatened by hunting, habitat loss, poisoning and both often get run over on the country lanes. They do tend to live around farms as the hedgerow habitat and plentiful food supply suits them. This often leads them into conflict with farmers, especially problematic are stoats who are very able at snatching chickens, eggs as well as game birds."

It usually rests during the day in water that is 1 \u2013 2 metres (3 \u2013 6 feet) deep, sometimes in the middle of a watercourse or hidden in mangrove roots or under natant vegetation. The West African manatee makes little disturbance in the water while swimming.Seasonal movements of the West African manatee,\u00a0 in response to changes in water level that affect availability of food and/or water salinity, have been reported for several areas.In Sierra Leone, it was reported that this manatee is present in the main river channels year-round, but that a migration of some sort may take place, with an influx of new animals arriving in most upriver areas as flooding begins in June and July. An individual manatee may travel 30 \u2013 40 kilometres per day (19 \u2013 25 miles per day) through lagoons and rivers.",
            "reproduction": "The breeding period of the West African Manatee is uncertain and may last throughout the year, as is the case with the Amazonian and American manatees.\u00a0 One manatee calf is produced each breeding period. Birth occurs in shallow lagoons.The West African manatee is mostly solitary, with mothers and calves being the principal social unit. However, they will often rest together in loose, small groups of two to six individuals.\u00a0",
            "conservation and threats": "In the past, the West African manatees population decline has been attributed largely to hunting and incidental capture in fishing nets. Recently, continuing uncontrolled and likely unsustainable hunting is considered the major threat. Despite legal protection, the manatee is still hunted throughout its range for meat, leather and oil, by harpoon, trap, net and snagline.The West African manatee is known to die accidentally in shark nets, trawls, set nets and weirs. It is sometimes also killed in turbines or control gates of dams. The coastal wetlands that are a major habitat for this manatee have already been heavily damaged and are further severely threatened.

Manatees are not territorial and do not have complex predator avoidance behaviour, as they have evolved in areas without natural predators.The West Indian Manatee is an opportunistic feeder, with large adults feasting on nearly 100 kilograms of sea grasses and plant leaves daily. Because manatees feed on abrasive plants, their molars are often worn down and are continually replaced throughout life. They are also known to eat invertebrates and fish.",
            "reproduction": "Although female West Indian Manatees are mostly solitary creatures, they form mating herds while in estrus (ready to reproduce). Most females breed successfully between ages of 7 and 9 years old, however, females are capable of reproduction as early as 4 years of age.Gestation period lasts from 12 to 14 months. Normally, one manatee calf is born, although on rare occasions two have been recorded.

            "desc": "The Western Lowland Gorilla (Gorilla Gorilla Gorilla) belongs to the family \u2018Pongidae\u2019, which includes four species of great apes: the Gorilla, Common Chimpanzee, Bonobo or Pygmy Chimpanzee and Orangutan. The Western Lowland Gorilla lives in the tropical rainforests spread across six countries across west equatorial Africa which include: southeast Nigeria, Gabon, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo and Equatorial Guinea.  ",
            "western lowland gorilla characteristics": "The Western Lowland Gorilla is the largest of all primates. Western Lowland Gorillas have broad shoulders, a muscular neck and strong hands and feet. Their considerable size gives them a good defence against predators and they live in relative safety on the ground, more so than any other primate.The Western Lowland Gorillas body is covered by short, thin grey-black or brown-black hair. A gorillas face has no hair, however, they do have a thick ridge above their eyes.A mature male Western Lowland Gorilla has silver fur on its back. These adult gorillas are called \u2018Silverbacks\u2019. Western Lowland Gorillas can walk for short distances on two legs however, they generally get around by walking on all fours. When doing this, they walk on their knuckles which is known as \u2018knuckle-walking\u2019.Western Lowland Gorillas are omnivores, however, they are sometimes classed as herbivores because they mostly eat plants. They survive primarily on fruit, leaves and foliage. Western Lowland Gorillas sometimes do eat insects such as termites and ants to supplement their diets. Western Lowland Gorillas do not drink water as they get adequate moisture from the foilage they consume.The only predators to the Western Lowland Gorilla are leopards and human beings.",
            "western lowland gorilla behaviour": "Western Lowland Gorillas form small, non-territorial harems usually dominated by a single, mature male gorilla. They live in structured family groups. A group will consist of one adult silverback gorilla, several unrelated female gorillas and infant gorillas.The silverback gorilla is the dominant gorilla in the family and he regulates the schedule of his group. Western Lowland Gorillas will spend several hours of the morning eating, take a break in the middle of the day and then eat again before nightfall. During the mid-day break, young gorillas play with each other while the adults sleep.While Western Lowland Gorillas are social creatures and need other gorillas around to survive, the only very strong bond they form is the bond between a male gorilla and its female gorilla mates. Western Lowland Gorillas are quiet, shy, non-aggressive animals. There is very little conflict between groups that have overlapping territories, although when threatened, the male gorilla does everything it can to scare off the predator or trespasser.Adult Western Lowland Gorillas perform elaborate displays, including chest beating, running sideways and tearing up vegetation to frighten off an intruding male or other threat. Male Western Lowland Gorillas also use these displays as a show of dominance within the group.Adult female gorillas can become aggressive when defending their infants, or while helping each other drive off rowdy, young adult male gorillas. The silverback is the peace keeper and intervenes between occasional squabbles between female gorillas.Western Lowland Gorillas build a nest every night out of plant material to sleep in and a day nest for their midday rest.",
            "western lowland gorilla reproduction": "Western Lowland Gorillas sexually mature in the wild between the ages of 7 to 8 and in captivity approximately 5 and a half years old. Male Western Lowland Gorillas sexually mature in the wild between 8 to 9 years old and in captivity as early as 6 years old. Males are not considered fully mature until about 15 years old. Western Lowland Gorillas do not have a distinct breeding season. Gestation lasts from 250 to 270 days (8 \u2013 9 months). In the wild, female gorillas usually deliver their first offspring at 10 \u2013 11 years old and at 4year intervals thereafter. One infant gorilla is normally produced and twins are rare.Birth occurs with the female gorilla in supine position, over the course of a few minutes. After the baby gorilla is delivered, the mother gorilla severs the umbilical cord. The offspring are born helpless and must be carried in the mothers arms.At birth, infant gorillas weigh 4 \u2013 5 pounds (1.8 \u2013 2.3 kilograms) and have sparse hair covering their pink-grey skin. The mother gorilla holds her newborn infant belly-to-belly for close contact until it develops the strength and coordination to cling onto her hair at about 2 months. The huge silverback is a patient father who will play with the infant once it becomes mobile.",
            "western lowland gorilla life cycle": "At about nine to 10 weeks, infant gorillas begin to crawl on their own and soon walk on all four limbs. A white patch of hair appears on their rumps at about the same time they begin to walk. The white patch helps the mother keep track of the infant and assists other group members in identifying the gorilla as an infant. The rump patch begins to disappear at about age 3, the same age that weaning usually begins.Females remain with their natal group until about age 8 or 9, then join an unrelated group or a solitary male. Males remain with their natal group until about age 12, then begin to go off on their own. Solitary males try to attract females from other groups to form their own group.The frequency and duration of sexual activity in gorillas are low in comparison to other great apes. Only the silverback, or dominant male, is allowed to mate with the adult females in his group. The reproductive success of males depends upon the maintenance of exclusive rights to adult females, which is ensured by males forming a permanent bond with each female in a social group.The formation of these bonds keeps adult females from leaving the group or mating with other males. Normally quiet animals, gorillas are unusually loud during copulation (mating).Life span: Western Lowland Gorillas live 30 to 40 years in the wild, 40 to 60 years in captivity.",
            "western lowland gorilla diet": "In the wild: A gorillas diet is similar to that of the chimpanzee, however, these gorillas eat larger fruits and mature leaves and stems. The gorillas diet includes parts of at least 97 plant species, as well as invertebrates, such as termites and ants. About 67% of their diet is fruit, 17% is seeds, leaves, stems and pith. Animal prey, including termites, caterpillars, and other insect larvae make up the rest.Western Lowland Gorillas eat fruits during the wet season and more herbs and bark in the dry season. They seem to prefer sugary fruits and pith, as well as protein-rich leaves and bark.Like other apes, gorillas feed on seasonal fruits and disperse seeds in their dung as they travel from place to place. The male gorillas range further in the wet season in search of fruit and spend more time on the ground eating herbs in the dry season. Female gorillas feed higher in the trees and eat more leaves than males.At the zoo: Gorillas eat vegetables, fruits, leaf eater biscuits, browse (cut branches from a variety of trees, herbaceous plants, alfalfa, ferns, clover), non-fat milk and yogurt and a vitamin and mineral supplement. Gorillas in captivity tend to eat less bulk food than those in the wild.Adult male gorillas eat about 60 \u2013 70 pounds of food per day. Adult female gorillas eat about two thirds of that amount.",
            "western lowland gorilla vocalisation": "Gorillas can make up to 25 vocalizations such as grunts, laughs, hoots, barks and screams, each with its own specific meaning.",
            "western lowland gorilla conservation status": "Western Lowland Gorillas have no known enemies except humans. Humans have threatened their livelihood for over a century and have caused them to become endangered through the degradation of the tropical rainforest, illegal hunting for meat, big game hunting, sale of live young gorillas and over-collection by zoos and research institutions.Many gorillas have been shot and killed in the name of self-defense because if provoked long enough, gorillas will charge toward an attacker in order to scare them away. However, they charge to intimidate, not to injure and rarely make actual contact with one another under these circumstances. Their last chance for survival may be a few gorilla sanctuaries in Africa, zoos and other captive environments in other parts of the world.Western Lowland Gorillas are found in zoos all over the world. They have been important in behavioural research because their intelligence and body structure are closer to that of humans than any other primate except for chimpanzees. Western Lowland Gorillas are very intelligent and have even been taught sign language. They are quite capable of doing complex tasks.Since Wednesday 12th September 2007, the Western Lowland Gorilla was moved from being endangered to critically endangered. This is due to human alteration and loss of habitat. Gorillas, orangutans and corals are among the plants and animals which are sliding closer to extinction.The Red List of Threatened Species for 2007 names habitat loss, hunting and climate change among the causes. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) has identified more than 16,000 species threatened with extinction.What is the Scientific Name of the Western Lowlands Gorilla?The scientific name for the Western Lowlands Gorilla is \u2018Gorilla Gorilla Gorilla\u2019"

            "desc": "Whales belong to the order Cetacea which has 79 species, including Dolphins, Porpoises and Killer Whales (orcas). The name \u2018Whale\u2019 is quite a confusing term when classifying these large mammals. Some Whales that are called \u2018Whales\u2019 are not actually Whales. It can refer to all cetaceans, to just the larger ones, or only to members of particular families within the order Cetacea. Whales are those cetaceans which are neither Dolphins (i.e. members of the families Delphinidae or Platanistoidea) nor Porpoises. This can lead to some confusion because Orcas (\u2018Killer Whales\u2019) and Pilot Whales have \u2018whale\u2019 in their name, however, they are Dolphins for the purpose of classification.",
            "whale characteristics": "Whales are mammals most fully adapted to aquatic life. Their body is a stream-lined shape which allows them to glide gracefully through the water. Their forelimbs are modified into flippers. Their tiny hind limbs are vestigial; they do not attach to the backbone and are hidden within the body. The tail has horizontal flukes. Whales are practically hairless and are insulated by a thick layer of blubber.Like all mammals, whales breathe air into lungs, are warm-blooded and feed their young milk from mammary glands.Different species of whale are different characteristically including appearance, size and shape. Some whales (such as Sperm Whales and Baleen Whales) sometimes have rudimentary hind limbs; some even with feet and digits. Most species of whale bear a fin on their backs known as a dorsal fin.All whales breathe through \u2018blow-holes\u2019 which are located on the top of their heads. This allows them to submerge beneath the surface of the water for long periods of time. Baleen Whales have two blow-holes on the top of their heads whereas Toothed Whales only have one. Some whales, such as the Sperm Whale, can stay underwater for up to two hours holding a single breath.",
            "": "Killer Whales and Pilot Whales live in extremely large pods that contain many generations of whales. They live comfortably together, congregating and helping each other with hunting, feeding, migrating and caring for the young.",
            "loudest whale": "The loudest Whale is also the Blue Whale, their call can reach up to 188 decibels and can be heard over hundreds even thousands of miles away. The Blue Whale is louder than a jet plane which reaches 140 decibels. The loudest a human can shout is about 70 decibels. Sounds that reach 120 \u2013 130 decibels are quite painful to human ears!",
            "fastest whale": "The fastest swimming whale is the Killer Whale or Orcas. These whales can reach speeds of 30 miles per hour although the Dall\u2019s Porpoise and the Sei Whale may be even faster.Killer Whales are also the deadliest Whales in the oceans. Everyday, an Orcas needs to eat hundreds of pound of fish, marine mammals (including other whales), squid, sea birds, etc. Killer Whales need to eat 3 \u2013 4% of their body weight each day (baby whales (calves) eat about 10% of their body weight daily). Food is generally swallowed whole and not chewed at all. Killer Whales are skilled hunters, they either hunt alone or in Pods (schools of whales) which circle the prey and is a more efficient way of hunting.",
            "deepest diving whale": "The deepest diver is the Sperm Whale who dive to 10,500 feet to prey on Giant Squids.These deep dives last as long as 40 minutes each time, with occasional 10 minute breaks at the surface. The Sperm Whale also has the largest brain of all whales. Its brain weighs around 20 pounds (9 kilograms).",
            "most musical whale": "The most musical whale is the Humpback Whale whose complex noises create beautiful tunes. These whales are also the noisiest Whales (not the loudest). Their squeaks and grunts are long, varied and haunting.The most beautiful sounds are made when they are in warm waters, however, in colder waters, their sounds are a little rougher. The songs have the largest range of frequencies used by whales, ranging from 20 \u2013 9,000 Hertz.",
            "whale with the longest tooth": "The Narwhal has the longest tooth which measures up to 7 \u2013 10 feet (2 \u2013 3 metres) long.",
            "whale with the longest baleen": "The Bowhead whales have the longest baleen. The Bowhead Whale has around 350 pairs of black baleen plates with silver-colored bristles hanging from its jaws. The baleen is very fine and measure about 175.5 inches long and 14 inches wide."

            "desc": "White Bengal tigers or tigers of mixed Bengal/Amur ancestry have pink noses, white-to-creme colored fur and black, grey or chocolate-colored stripes. White Bengal tigers eyes are usually blue, but may be green or amber. There are several hundred captive White Bengal tigers worldwide (this number increases annually), all of whom can trace their ancestry back to \u2018Mohan\u2019, a White Bengal tiger caught in Rewa, India in 1951. \u00a0",
            "characteristics": "White Bengal tigers are fully grown at 2 \u2013 3 years of age. Male White Bengal tigers reach weights of 200 \u2013 230 kilograms and up to 3 metres in length. The female White Bengal tigers weigh 130 \u2013 170 kilograms and measure up to 2.5 metres long.White Bengal tigers have stripes all over their body. Their stripes are like fingerprints, no two are the same. The stripes are not only in the tigers fur, but are a pigmentation of the skin. White Bengal tigers have a white spot on the back of their ears which looks like an eye.White Bengal tigers grow faster and heavier than their orange relatives and with their pale ice blue eyes, white fur with chocolate colored stripes, pink noses and pink paw pads they are indeed a beautiful sight.Unfortunately, White Bengal tigers are subject to extreme inbreeding because of the demand for their rare colorings. Inbreeding is not a natural occurrence and can to lead certain deformities in the newborns.A White Bengal tiger cub can only be born when both parents carry the unusual gene for white coloring. The double recessive allele (a viable DNA coding that occupies a given position on a chromosome) in the genetic code only turns up naturally about once in every 10,000 births. For unexplained reasons it seems to occur only in the Bengal subspecies.White Bengal tigers are also called Indian tigers, they are the most numerous in population than any other tiger subspecies. White Bengal tigers were killed as a part of sport carried out by Indian and British royalties.There number declined at a fast rate. White Bengal tigers are one of the only two species of cats that like water. At full running speed they reach speed of up to 60 kilometres per hour. They do not possess great stamina. The average White Bengal tiger sleeps between 16 to 18 hours per day.\u00a0",
            "behaviour and diet": "White Bengal tigers lead solitary lives and the courtship period and association between mother and cub is their only interaction and association. Tigers are entirely different in their hunting habits from lions. Tigers rest during the day in the shade and begin to hunt for food at dusk. White Bengal tigers have keen eye sight and a sharp hearing that helps them stalk their prey.Tiger killings are split second actions where the prey hardly has any chance of survival. The Tigers formidable and retractile claws play a significant role in capturing and holding on to its prey.The White Bengal tigers diet in the wild is water buffalo, goat, deer and wild boar. Their diet in captivity is mainly chicken, horsemeat or kangaroo meat five days a week. They also fast on bones twice a week in captivity.\u00a0",
            "s": "Due to the small size of the gene pool, many White Bengal tigers suffer from health problems due to inbreeding. For this reason, responsible zoos refuse to breed two White Bengal tigers together.However, two white parents are the only way to ensure white cubs. If a White Bengal tiger mates with a partner that is heterozygous for the gene, only half of the offspring will be white.Therefore, due to the high demand for White Bengal tigers, less scrupulous breeders still breed white tigers together. Some animal rights activists have called for a halt to the breeding of White Bengal tigers altogether.Outside of India, highly inbred White Bengal tigers are prone to crossed eyes (strabismus) due to incorrectly routed visual pathways in the brain), star-gazing and postural problems, a weakened immune system and poor tolerance of anaesthesia, possibly due to inability to synthesize the tyrosinase enzyme.Strabismus is associated with white tigers of Bengal/Amur ancestry. Only one pure Bengal white tiger was reported to be cross eyed, this being Mohini\u2019s daughter Rewati.White Bengal tigers may also be prone to Chediak-Higashi Syndrome which causes bluish lightening of the fur color and is associated with crossed eyes. Other genetic problems include shortened tendons of the forelegs, clubbed feet, central retinal degeneration, abnormal kidneys, arched or crooked backbone and twisted neck.Reduced fertility and miscarriages were noted by Sankhala (the director of the New Delhi Zoo in the 1960s) and were attributed to inbreeding depression. Some of the white tigers born to North American lines have bulldog faces with a snub nose, jutting jaw, domed head and wide-set eyes with an indentation between the eyes. However, some of these traits have also been linked to poor diet.There are only a small quantity of white tigers in existence and present numbers are put in the region of 500. With the inevitable inbreeding problems a debate continually rages over the wisdom of breeding this animal. White tigers, white lions, white peacocks, none are representative of their wild populations.The Tiger Species Survival Programme has actively discouraged breeding white tigers because of their mixed ancestry. Most of these animals have been hybridised with members of other subspecies usually of an unknown lineage.Other organisations object to white tigers both because of the lack of genetic diversity and because it serves no practical conservation purpose.Some opponents state that white tiger breeding only inflates the stud book entries for zoos and provides a popular exhibit which helps increase attendance and revenue."

Behind the elephants, this is probably the most massive remaining land animal. The White rhino is larger than the Black rhino, in fact the White rhino can grow to be larger than any other land mammal except for elephants. The White Rhinoceros is well known for its wide mouth used for grazing and for being the most social of all rhino species. ",
            "ceros characteristics": "The White Rhino has a massive body and large head, a short neck and broad chest. This rhino can exceed 6,670 pounds (3,000 kilograms), have a head-and-body length of 3.35 \u2013 4.2 metres (11 \u2013 13.9 feet) and a shoulder height of 150 \u2013 185 centimetres (60 \u2013 73 inches). The record size of the White Rhinoceros was about 3,600 kilograms in weight The White Rhinoceros is native to north-eastern and southern Africa.White rhinos have almost no hair. They have a squared (not pointed) upper lip, a longer skull and less sharply defined forehead and a more pronounced shoulder hump than the Black rhino which supports its large head. White rhinos have two horns, the front one averaging 60 centimetres long, but occasionally reaching 150 centimetres.The White rhino is a dull grey color, however, because they love to wallow in mud, their skin can become brownish or take the color of the mud they wallow in.Despite their huge size and bulkiness, White rhinos can run as fast as 40 miles per hour. They are very agile too and can turn quickly in a very small space. The White rhino is an ungulate animal, with hoofs that have three toes on each foot. They are more closely related to horses (who are also ungulates) than hippos are.",
            "ceros habitat": "The White rhino lives in Africa \u2013 same as the Black rhino. The White rhinos habitat is tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas and shrub lands.",
            "ceros diet": "One interesting fact about the White rhino is that, it is a herbivore and it can eat plants that are toxic to other animals. If it was not for these type of rhinos, the African plains would be over-run with these pesky toxic plants. Because the White rhino has a wider mouth, it tends to be a grazing animal. It feeds on grass and can eat grass faster than you could mow it. The White Rhinoceros is capable of going 4 or 5 days without water.",
            "ceros behaviour": "The White Rhinoceroses tend to group in herds of one to seven animals, although they are usually solitary animals.With their poor eyesight, white rhinos will charge first and then see if there is anything to worry about after. White rhinos rely on their sense of smell and hearing which is well developed. Because of this feature, they have been called, irritable and clumsy animals \u2013 this could not be further from the truth. White rhinos use their ears, nostrils, posture and a very complex breathing system for communication and expression. (A bit like morse-code).The white rhino tends to avoid the heat during the day, in which it will rest in the shade. It is therefore usually active early mornings, late afternoon and during the evening. During peaks of heat, the White rhino cools and rids itself of \u2018ectoparasites\u2019 (external parasites) by bathing in mud in shallow pools. Adult males can spend almost their entire life in these areas, unless water is unavailable, in which case they will go off to a drinking site every 3 \u2013 4 days.",
            "ceros reproduction": "The gestation period of the female White rhino is 15 \u2013 16 months. A single calf is born after this time and weighs around 150 pounds.If there is an unpredicted disturbance, the calf will always run in front of its mother.",

Their wild population has been reduced from about 500 in the 1970s to only about 4 today.",
            "\u2019 when it is not \u2018white\u2019?": "The name White Rhino originated in South Africa where the Afrikaans language developed from the Dutch language. The Afrikaans word wyd (derived from the Dutch word wijd), which means wide, referred to the width of the rhinoceros mouth. Early English settlers in South Africa misinterpreted the wyd for white.So the rhino with the wide mouth ended up being called the White Rhino and the other one, with the narrow pointed mouth, was called the Black Rhinoceros. The wide mouth was adapted to cropping large swaths of grass, while the narrow mouth was adapted to eating leaves on bushes. A White Rhinos skin color is quite similar to that of the Black Rhino.An alternative common name for the white rhinoceros, more accurate but rarely used, is the square-lipped rhinoceros. The White Rhinos genus, Ceratotherium, appropriately means \u2018horned beast\u2019.",
            "ceros conservation status": "White rhinos tend to have a calmer temperament than the Black rhino \u2013 they are not so aggressive. However, because they like to graze on grasslands they are more vulnerable to poachers hunting for horns than the highly-strung black rhino. It is thanks to conservationists in Kenya that the White rhino has been re-introduced and allowed to breed and increase their numbers. However, all five species of rhino are classed as an endangered species."

            "white stork characteristics": "The white stork has a strong body which measures 100 \u2013 115 centimetres (39 \u2013 45 inches) from beak tip to tail end and weighs 2.5 \u2013 4.4 kilograms. It has a wingspan of 195 \u2013 215 centimetres (77 \u2013 85 inches).The white stork is a distinctive large wading bird which has a white plumage with black flight feathers and wing coverts. The black coloration is caused by the pigment melanin and carotenoids in their diet.Adult white storks have long pointed red beaks, long red legs with partially webbed feet on the end and a long, slender neck. They have black skin around their eyes and their claws are blunt and nail-like. Males and females are identical in appearance, however, males are slightly larger in size. The feathers on the chest are long and form a ruff which is sometimes used when performing courtship displays.The white stork\u2019s wings are long and broad which enables the bird to soar easily on air thermals. The storks wingbeats when flapping, have a slow but regular pattern. Like most wading birds, white storks are a spectacular sight when soaring through the air, with their long necks out-stretched forwards and their long legs out-stretched backwards well beyond the end of its short tail. They flap their huge, broad wings as little as possible to save energy.On ground, the white stork walks at a slow steady pace with its head stretched upwards. When resting, it tends to hunch its head between its shoulders. The white storks primary flight feathers moult yearly and are replaced during the breeding season.",
            "white stork habitat": "The white stork\u2019s preferred habitats are riverbanks, marshes, swamps, ditches, grasslands and meadows. White storks tend to avoid areas that are overgrown with tall trees and shrubs.",
            "white stork diet": "The white stork is completely diurnal (active during the day). Its preferred feeding grounds are shallow wetlands, grassy meadows and farmland. The white stork is a carnivore and feeds up on a variety of animal from both the ground and from shallow water. Prey includes amphibians, reptiles such as lizards, snakes and frogs, insects, fish, small birds and mammals.",
            "white stork behaviour": "White storks are vocal birds who produce a noisy bill-clattering sound made by rapidly opening and closing their beaks which is amplified by the throat pouch which acts as a sound box. Young storks produce croaks, whistles and whines when begging for food and also begin the typical beak clattering.White storks are gregarious birds who flock in their thousands when on long distance migration routes and when wintering in sub-saharan Africa.When migrating between Europe and Africa, the white stork avoids crossing the Mediterranian Sea and instead flies via the Levant in the east or the Strait of Gibraltar in the west. This is because the air thermals do not form over the Mediterranean Sea on which it depends upon for long flights. Migrating White Storks use the uplift of air thermals to reduce the effort of long distance flying and therefore able to fly further with less fatigue.White Stork nests are built by mating pairs. The nests are large, solidly constructed platforms made from sticks and are built in trees in loose colonies close to water sources. Each nest measures 1 \u2013 2 metres (3.3 \u2013 6.6 feet) in depth, 0.8 \u2013 1.5 metre (2.6 \u2013 4.9 feet) in diametre, and 60 \u2013 250 kilograms (130 \u2013 550 pounds) in weight. Nests may be used for several years. Several other bird species often nest within the large nests of the White Stork such as Sparrows, Tree Sparrows and Common Starlings.The White Stork is famous for building its large stick nests on top of buildings and other structures when suitable trees are unavailable.The White Stork breeds in larger numbers in areas with open grasslands, particularly grassy areas which are wet or frequently flooded, and less in areas with taller vegetation cover such as forests and shrublands. Non-breeding birds gather into groups of 40 \u2013 50 during the breeding season.",
            "white stork reproduction": "Most White Storks are monogamous and pair for life. Female storks lay 2 \u2013 5 chalky-white eggs which are laid at two day intervals. Eggs hatch after 33 \u2013 34 days of incubation. The incubation period is shared between both parents.After hatching, both parents take turns to feed the chicks. Food is placed on the edge of the nest by the parents but water is provided by regurgitation.When newly hatched, young white storks have pinkish legs and a small black beak with a brown tip. young storks have two successive coats of down. Its body is firstly partly covered with short, sparse downy feathers which are whitish in color which are replaced after around a week with a fluffy white down. Flight feathers appear after 3 weeks along with black scapulars (shoulder feathers).The chicks fledge after about 2 months and usually begin breeding when they are 3 \u2013 5 years old.

            "white stork conservation status": "The White Stork is classed as \u2018Least Concern\u2019 by the IUCN. The White Stork is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. However, threats to the white stork include the continued loss of wetlands, collisions with overhead power lines, use of persistent pesticides (such as DDT \u2013 dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane \u2013 a synthetic pesticide) to combat locusts in Africa, and largely illegal hunting on migration routes and wintering grounds.Did you know this about the White Strok?According to northern European legend, the stork is responsible for bringing babies to new parents. The legend is very ancient, but was popularised by a 19th century Hans Christian Andersen story called \u2018The Storks\u2019. German folklore held that storks found babies in caves or marshes and brought them to households in a basket on their backs or held in their beaks. These caves contained \u2018stork stones\u2019. The babies would then be given to the mother or dropped down the chimney. Households would notify when they wanted children by placing sweets for the stork on the window sill.The White Stork is a popular motif on postage stamps, and it is featured on more than 120 stamps issued by more than 60 stamp-issuing entities.The White Stork is featured in 2 of Aesop\u2019s Fables \u2013 \u2018The Fox and the Stork\u2019 and \u2018The Farmer and the Stork\u2019.Storks have little fear of humans if not disturbed, and often nest on buildings in Europe. In Germany, the presence of a strok nest on a house was believed to protect against fires. They were also protected because of the belief that their souls were human.The Hebrew word for the White Stork is chasidah meaning \u2018merciful\u2019 or \u2018kind. Greek and Roman mythology portray storks as models of parental devotion, and it was believed that they did not die of old age, but flew to islands and took the appearance of humans."

The Wild Boar lives in woodlands across much of Central Europe, the Mediterranean Region (including North Africas Atlas Mountains), and much of Asia as far south as Indonesia. Animals similar to the wild boar include the Warthog of Africa and the Peccary or Javelina of the American Southwest. The Peccary and Warthog do not share the pigs taxonomic gens. The Peccary is actually in a different family.  Wild Boars can reach up to 440lb (200kg), occasionally even 660lb (300kg) for adult males, and can be up to 6 feet (1.8 metres) long. If surprised or cornered, they may become aggressive and can cause injury with their tusks. However, this is quite rare and usually only occurs if a sow feels the need to defend her piglets.",

            "behaviour": "Wild boars live in groups called sounders. Sounders typically contain around 20 animals, but groups of over 50 have been seen. In a typical sounder there are two or three sows and their offspring; adult male Wild Boars are not part of the sounder outside of the autumnal breeding season and are usually found alone. Birth, called farrowing, usually occurs in the spring. A litter will typically contain five piglets, however, up to 13 piglets in one litter have been known.Wild boars are usually nocturnal, foraging from dusk until dawn but with resting periods during both night and day. This is because hunters are most active during the day. Wild boars eat almost anything they come across, including nuts, berries, carrion, roots, tubers, refuse, insects, small reptiles, even young deer and lambs.",
            "histroy": "The wild boar became extinct in Great Britain in the 17th century, however, wild breeding populations have recently returned in some areas, particularly the Weald (a region in the south of England) following escapes from boar farms.Wild boars are hunted both for their meat, considered a delicacy, and to mitigate the damage they cause to crops and forests. Historically, wild boar hunting was traditionally done by groups of spearmen using a specialised boar spear. The wild boar spear was fitted with a cross guard to stop the enraged animal driving its pierced body further down the shaft in order to attack its killer before dying.The hair of the wild boar was often used for the production of the toothbrush until the invention of synthetic materials in the 1930s. The hair for the bristles usually came from the neck area of the wild boar. Popular because the bristles were soft, it was not the best material for oral hygiene as the hairs were slow to dry and usually retained bacteria."

            "desc": "Rabbits (Orytolagus cuniculus) originated from Spain and South-West France. The rabbit was brought to England in the 12th century AD by the Normans and kept in captivity in warrens as a source of meat and fur. Many escaped into the wild and eventually become so common that farming them was no longer economic. Because of their fast breeding, a diet of virtually any vegetable matter and persecution of predators, the rabbit slowly established itself in the wild in Britain, despite originally favouring a warmer, drier climate.",
            "rabbit description": "The male is called a buck and the female a doe. Rabbits generally measure 40 \u2013 45 centimetres in length and have ears that measure 8.5 centimetres long. They have compact bodies with long, powerful hind legs.A Rabbits fur is generally long and soft and is grey/brown in color and they have white underparts and a short tail. Their long ears of rabbits are most likely an adaptation for detecting predators. Wild rabbits are rather uniform in body proportions and stance.The smallest is the pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis), at only 20 centimetres in length and 0.4 kilograms in weight, while the largest rabbits grow to 50 centimetres and more than 2 kilograms.",
            "rabbit habitats": "Rabbits are ground dwellers that live in environments ranging from desert to tropical forest and wetland. The European rabbit occupies open landscapes such as fields, parks and gardens. Rabbits are abundant in grassland areas where the soil allows them to make extensive, well-drained burrows, but also where there are hedges or patches of woodland to give shelter and cover.",
            "rabbit diet": "Rabbits are herbivores who feed by grazing on grass, forbs and leafy weeds, however, they will also eat all vegetable matter and gnaw tree bark in winter months. Rabbits re-swallow up to 80% of their faeces to use their food more efficiently in a process known as \u2018refection\u2019.Rabbits graze heavily and rapidly for roughly the first half hour of a grazing period (usually in the late afternoon), followed by about half an hour of more selective feeding. In this time, the rabbit will also excrete many hard faecal pellets, being waste pellets that will not be reingested. If the environment is relatively non-threatening, the rabbit will remain outdoors for many hours, grazing at intervals. Rabbits are incapable of vomiting due to the physiology of their digestive system.",
            "rabbit behaviour": "The European rabbit constructs the most extensive burrow systems, called warrens. Warren tunnels can be 1 \u2013 2 metres long. The nest at the end of the tunnel is lined with grass, moss and belly fur. They use regular trails, which they scent mark with faecal pellets.The European rabbit is the most social rabbit, sometimes forming groups in warrens of up to 20 individuals. Most rabbits are relatively solitary and sometimes territorial, coming together only to breed or occasionally to forage in small groups.During territorial disputes rabbits will sometimes \u2018box\u2019 using their front limbs. Rabbits are active throughout the year, no species is known to hibernate. Rabbits are generally nocturnal and they also are relatively silent. Other than loud screams when frightened or caught by a predator, the only sound signal known for most species is a loud foot thump made to indicate alarm or aggression.Instead of sound, scent seems to play an important role in the communication systems of most rabbits. They possess well-developed glands throughout their body and rub them on fixed objects to convey group identity, sex, age, social and reproductive status and territory ownership. Urine is also used in chemical communication. When danger is perceived, the general tendency of rabbits is to freeze and hide under cover. If chased by a predator, they engage in quick, irregular movement, designed more to evade and confuse than to outdistance a pursuer.",
            "rabbit reproduction": "Rabbits generally are able to breed at a young age and many regularly produce litters of up to 7 young, often doing so 4 or 5 times a year due to the fact that a rabbits gestation period is only 28 to 31 days. Newborn rabbits are naked, blind and helpless at birth. Mothers are remarkably inattentive to their young and are almost absentee parents, commonly nursing their young only once per day and for just a few minutes.To overcome this lack of attention, the milk of rabbits is highly nutritious and among the richest of all mammals. The young grow rapidly and most are weaned in about a month.Males (bucks) do not assist in rearing the kittens. The mother rabbit is able to become pregnant again 4 days after the birth of her kittens.Domesticated Rabbits have an average lifespan of up to 9 years whereas wild rabbits have a life expectancy of less than 4 years.",
            "rabbit conservation status": "Rabbit populations are increasing, as they are becoming immune to the myxomatosis virus. Rabbits become sexually mature after just four months and breed rapidly, so they can readily replace themselves."

Wildebeest are antelopes and belong to the bovidae family which also includes cows, goats and sheep. Wildebeest are one of the most abundant large mammals in Africa and there is thought to be around 1.5 million migratory individuals in the Serengeti alone forming the greatest concentration of wild grazing animals on Earth.",

            "behaviour": "Wildebeest move around in massive herds, some stay in the same place while others are nomadic and are in constant search for new food sources. Many have to make dangerous crossings such as the Kenya Masai Mara. Migrating wildebeest must cross 2 wide rivers where Nile Crocodiles await them. When the crocodiles spot a weak wildebeest, they block its route back to shore and start to close in on it.Wildebeest move around in huge herds probably because there is safety in numbers. The bigger the group, the less risk an individual faces of being picked out by predators. Predators do follow the herds around and will prey up on the young and the weak.Herds of wildebeest drop tonnes of dung while on the move around but it is soon cleared up by swarms of Dung Beetles who roll the dung into balls and bury it before eating it or laying eggs in it. Sometimes herds of over 500 wildebeest will stampede and run at over 50 miles per hour and although destructive, the stampedes encourage new plant growth and soil renewal.Wildebeest are most active in the mornings and late afternoons mainly resting during the heat of the night and also during the night. Wildebeest are noisy creatures and make vocalizations which include grunting calls, moans and explosive snorts.\u00a0",
            "reproduction": "Male wildebeest mature at 3 \u2013 4 years and females at 2 \u2013 3 years. When the males mature, they will set up their territories which they mark with faeces and secretions emitted from their face and hoofs. They defend it from other males and attempt to mate with females entering their areas.Mating activity is seasonal and is usually timed so that the majority of calves are born close to the beginning of the rainy season when new grass is plentiful. Up to 500,000 calves are born in February and March each year, at the beginning of the rainy season. A single calf is born after a gestation period of 8 and a half months each year. Unlike other antelopes, the female does not need to give birth in a secluded location, she will give birth in the centre of the herd if need be.Calves can stand and run within minutes of being born but they must move with their mothers to have any chance of surviving as they are very vulnerable to lions, cheetahs, wild dogs and hyenas. Calves are suckled by their mothers for 6 months although they are able to eat grass after 10 days. Males leave the herd when they are one year old to form groups of bachelors.The life span of a wildebeest in the wild is 20 years.\u00a0",
            "conservation status": "Wildebeests are abundant and although numbers have increased in the Serengeti, numbers have declined in other areas such as south west Botswana due to competition with livestock. The destruction of crops have prompted farmers to kill wildebeests and also set up long fences to prevent the animals from migrating to wetlands when there are seasonal droughts. Continuing survival is dependant on conservation efforts."

Wolf spiders are robust, fast and agile hunters that rely on good eyesight to hunt, typically at night. Wolf spiders resemble nursery web spiders (family Pisauridae), however, they carry their egg sacs by attaching them to their spinnerets (instead of by means of their jaws and pedipalps). There are more than 100 genera and about 2,300 species of wolf spiders; 200 species live in the United States. This family belongs to the order of Araneae, which includes all known spiders. The Carolina wolf spider (Hogna carolinensis) is the official state spider of South Carolina, which is the only state that has a state spider. Their name comes from the Ancient Greek word \u03bb\u03cd\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, meaning \u201cwolf\u201d.",

            "location, habitat and webs": "Wolf spiders live almost everywhere in the world, besides the extreme polar region and the Antarctic. Spiderlings disperse aerially and, consequently, wolf spiders have wide distributions. They can be found in a wide range of habitats both coastal and inland \u2014 anywhere they can find insects to eat! These include shrub lands, woodland, wet coastal forest, alpine meadows and suburban gardens.They typically live on the ground, though some are known to climb partly up trees to catch their prey. The dark, mottled colors on their bodies help them blend in with decaying plant matter while hunting or avoiding predators. Sometimes they dig burrows or make holes under rocks or logs to live in.Wolf spiders are commonly known as household pests as when the weather starts getting colder, they look for warm places to overwinter in homes. Wolf spiders are commonly found around doors, windows, house plants, basements, garages and in almost all terrestrial habitats. Wolf spiders do not spin a web, instead, they roam at night to hunt for food. Wolf spiders are often confused with the Brown Recluse spider, however, they lack the violin-shaped marking of the recluse.",
            "diet": "Wolf spiders are insectivores and eat mostly ground-dwelling insects and other spiders, such as grasshoppers, ants and beetles. Less commonly they will eat small reptiles and amphibians. Some species chase down and grab their prey, while others wait for it to walk by and ambush it. Thanks to their excellent night vision, they primarily hunt in the dark. Some wolf spiders hunt in a set territory and return to a specific place to feed, while others wander nomadically with no territory or home.Wolf spiders often jump on their prey, hold it between their legs and roll over on their backs, trapping their prey with their limbs before biting it. They inject their venom into their prey, which liquefies the prey\u2019s internal organs!Two wolf spider species are known to be predators of cane toads. Lycosa lapidosa will take small toads and frogs while Lycosa obscuroides has been noted biting and killing a large toad within one hour.",
            "behavior": "The behavior of wolf spiders varies from species to species.Known as the sprinters of the spider world, wolf spiders can move very fast when catching prey. While they depend on their good eyesight to hunt, their sense of touch is also acute. Despite having a venomous bite, the wolf spider is shy and is most likely to run away when disturbed.When threatened by prey, they either use their bite or they also have the remarkable ability to detach a leg! They can later regenerate this leg.Wolf spiders play an important role in natural population control of insects and are often considered \u201cbeneficial bugs\u201d due to their predation of pest species within farms and gardens.",
            "reproduction": "Mating takes place outside the females burrow at night. Some adult male wolf spiders of smaller-sized species are known to disperse by air in order to find mates. As with spiders in general, males of almost any species can sometimes be found inside homes and buildings as they wander in search for females during the autumn.The male is attracted by scent markings left by the female, often associated with her drag-line silk. They also use their eyes more than many other types of spiders, use visual cues in mating. Males perform a courtship ritual prior to mating, often involving complex leg and palp signaling to the female.The female wolf spider constructs an egg sac of white papery silk, shaped like a ball with an obvious circular seam, which she then carries around attached with strong silk to her spinnerets. If the female is separated from the egg sac, she will search furiously for it. Mothers are known to exhibit aggressive behavior when carrying their egg sacs.When the spiderlings hatch, they are carried around on the females back until they are ready to disperse by ballooning or on the ground. Such a high degree of parental care is relatively unusual among spiders.",
            "venom": "The wolf spider is not aggressive, however, it will inject venom freely if continually provoked. Symptoms of its venomous bite include swelling, mild pain and itching. Though usually considered harmless to humans, wolf spider bites may be painful.Wolf Spider ConservationMost species of wolf spider are considered to have stable populations, although the exact populations are not known.

This land dwelling mammal is known by many other names including the Skunk Bear, Devil Bear, Carcajou (by the French-Canadians) and Glutten (by Europeans). The animal is so powerful that if it were the size of a bear, it would be the strongest animal on earth! There are two distinct subspecies of the wolverine animal: the American and the Eurasian. Despite their geographical differences, both subspecies are similar in appearance and behavior. The scientific name of this animal comes from the Latin gula, meaning gullet or throat, perhaps due to its voracious appetite. It is where we get the English word glutton. It is the only living member of the genus Gulo, but several extinct members are known from the fossil record dating as far back as five million years ago. It also belongs to the family of Mustelidae along with the badgers, weasels, otters, and minks.",
            "lifespan": "The wolverine has an average life expectancy of between 7 to 12 years in the wild. However, females in captivity have lived for as long as 17 years.",
            "habitat and location": "The wolverine lives in cold, high latitude regions across vast stretches of Canada, Russia, and Scandinavia. It used to be endemic to the United States, but now is only found in Alaska and some sporadic and isolated sections of the Rocky Mountains, such as Colorado, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana and Oregon, and the Sierras of California. They are also found in Utah but are very rarely seen, with only 6 confirmed sightings since the first confirmed sighting in 1979. In August 2020, the National Park Service reported that wolverines had been sighted at Mount Rainier, Washington.Wolverines prefer forest habitats and open plains. They frequent remote boreal forests, taiga and tundra biomes. Their dens usually consists of a small cave, rock crevice, fallen tree, or pre-existing burrow in which it can create a rough bed of grass and leaves.The animal exhibits a low population density and requires a very large home range. The range of a male wolverine can be more than 620 kilometres squared (240 square miles) while encompassing the ranges of several females (with smaller home ranges of roughly 130 \u2013 260 kilometres squared (50 \u2013 100 square miles).",
            "diet": "The wolverine is an omnivore and can change its diet based on season and location. They eat bird eggs, berries and any animal they can kill. In the summer, berries and plants are their main food, but in the winter they are more likely to eat rabbits and rodents.If live prey is unavailable, they will feed up on carrion (dead animal carcasses). This aggressive scavenger will challenge cougars and wolves for their prey. It has also been known to kill prey as large as moose. Wolverines will also dig into burrows and eat hibernating mammals. Wolverines kill prey with a bite to the neck, which severs the tendons and crushes the throat.Individuals may travel 15 miles (24 kilometres) in a day in search of food. They also frequently cache their food if there is too much of it. This is of particular importance to lactating females in the winter and early spring, a time when food is scarce",
            "behaviour": "The wolverine is a solitary animal who usually travels alone except for the breeding season. They almost never get along with members of the same sex. They are nocturnal animals that do not hibernate.It is basically a terrestrial animal, however they are very good at climbing trees and are also powerful swimmers. This allows them to escape from predators, too. They have great stamina and can travel great distances over rough terrain and deep snow without breaking for rest, up to six to nine miles before stopping. Adult males generally cover greater distances than females. They are very swift animals and can move around quickly, at speeds up to 30 mph (or 48 kph).Armed with powerful jaws, sharp claws and a thick hide, wolverines may defend kills against larger or more numerous predators. The wolverine makes few vocalizations except for the occasional grunts and growls to express its irritation.Male wolverines use scent glands to mark their territories, however, they share them with several females and are believed to be polygamous. This requirement for large territories brings them into conflict with human development.It has been suggested that the wolverine is actually a very intelligent animal. They have been known to follow human roads that have minimal traffic to speed up their travel time, and have also been able to sneak baits out of traps that are set by scientists for the purpose of collaring the animal.",
            "reproduction": "Wolverines are a polygamous species that tend to pair up with any member of the opposite sex living inside or overlapping with its territory. However, while some may mate multiple times, others will not mate at all.Wolverine mating season is in the summer, between May and August, however, the actual implantation of the embryo (blastocyst) in the uterus is stayed until early winter, delaying the development of the fetus.Females initiate the mating process, and a pair will spend a few days together alone to copulate and then goes on their separate ways. Female wolverines use natal (birthing) dens that are excavated in snow. Persistent, stable snow greater than 1.5 meters (5 feet) deep appears to be a requirement for natal denning, because it provides security for offspring and buffers cold winter temperatures.Females give birth to a litter of 2 to 4 young in the spring after a gestation period of 30 to 50 days. Kits are completely dependent on the mother at birth, but soon begin to grow quickly and are fully weaned off their mother\u2019s milk at the three months. They reach full size at a year old. Kits sometimes live with their mother until they reach their own reproductive age at about 2 years old. Females will often not produce young if food is scarce.Fathers make visits to their offspring until they are weaned at 10 weeks of age. Once the young are about six months old, some reconnect with their fathers and travel together for a time.Wolverine Conservation StatusThe worlds total wolverine animal population is unknown, but the species is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List 2007. While it is not currently an endangered species, hunting and trapping reducing the population\u2019s numbers, and has caused them to disappear from large parts of their former range.In the past, wolverines were hunted by trappers in North America for their beautiful coat, which was used as a lining for parkas for Arctic conditions. However, this is not as common these days, with the wolverine being given protective status in several regions.Around a hundred of these animals are held in zoos across North America and Europe, and they have been bred in captivity, but only with difficulty and high infant mortality",
            "predators": "The wolverine is an apex predator and therefore they have no natural predators, though they do come into conflict with (and may be killed by) other large predators over territory and food. Wolves, black bears, brown bears, cougars, and golden eagles are capable of killing wolverines, particularly young and inexperienced individuals.Humans are their biggest threat, and in the future, climate change could affect its habitat and result in habitat loss.",
            "fun fact!": "The wolverine is the official animal of the state of Michigan and the mascot for the University of Michigan sports teams, but evidence suggests that the species has never historically been present there in large numbers.Check out these great Wolverine pictures"

            "desc": "Wolves (Canis Lupus), are related to dogs, or more rightly, dogs are actually related to wolves. Wolves and dogs are quite similar in many ways, however, in most cases, wolves are larger animals. Wolves generally have longer legs than dogs. It is difficult to imagine, however, everything from a pug dog to a doberman comes from the wolf. The Wolf has developed the capacity to survive in the most inhospitable of climates. The wolves in the high arctic endure several winter months of perpetual darkness. Even in February when sun returns to the north, temperatures of -40\u00b0C and bitter winds are common.",
            "wolf characteristics": "Wolves are very intelligent creatures whose upright ears, sharp teeth, pointed muzzles, inquiring eyes and other facial features instantly convey this quality.The weight and size of a wolf can vary greatly worldwide. In general, height varies from 0.6 to .95 metres (26 \u2013 38 inches) at the shoulder and weight ranges from 20 to 62 kilograms. The Grey Wolf is the largest of all wild canids.Extreme specimens of wolf weighing more than 77 kilograms (170 pounds) have been recorded in Alaska and Canada, although they are rarely encountered.The heaviest wild wolf on record, killed in Alaska in 1939, was 80 kilograms (175 pounds). The smallest wolves come from the Arabian Wolf subspecies, the females of which may weigh as little as 10 kilograms (22 pounds) at maturity.Females in any given wolf population typically weigh about 20% less than their male counterparts. Wolves can measure anywhere from 1.3 to 2 metres (4.5 \u2013 6.5 feet) from nose to the tip of the tail, which itself accounts for approximately one quarter of overall body length.Wolves bodies are built for stamina, possessing features ideal for long distance travel. Their narrow chests and powerful backs and legs assist their efficient locomotion.Wolves are capable of covering several miles trotting at about a pace of 10 kilometres per hour (6 miles per hour) and have been known to reach speeds approaching 65 kilometres per hour (40 miles per hour) during a chase. While sprinting, wolves can cover up to 5 metres (16 feet) per run.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "wolf social structure": "Wolves are gregarious animals who mostly live in packs. A pack is made when a male and a female wolf meet each other and stay together. As a mated pair, they find a territory to settle in and raise cubs most years.Their cubs stay with them until they are old enough to leave home, usually by the time they are 3 years old and conditions are right to start a family or pack of their own. You can view a pack as a permanent core of a mated pair plus their continuously dispersing offspring.The hierarchy in a wolf pack is led by the alpha male and female. This affects all activity in the pack to some extent. In most larger packs, there are two separate hierarchies in addition to an overbearing one. The first consists of the males, led by the alpha male and the other consists of the females, led by the alpha female. In this situation, the alpha male assumes the top position overall in the pack.However, in some cases during the mating season the alpha female takes total dominance even while the pups are still in the den. This is for the rest of the pack to know that she is the one to serve. She also decides were the den will be. With this in the packs mind, they go in search of food and bring it back to the den either for the hungry female or for the pups.The male and female hierarchies are interdependent and are maintained constantly by aggressive and elaborate displays of dominance and submission. Control of breeding rights is one of the key privileges held by alpha wolves.Alphas are usually the only wolves in the pack to breed and they actively and sometimes aggressively prevent other adult wolves in the pack from breeding. If the other adults want to breed they usually have to leave their pack and set up elsewhere.Another privilege for the alpha pair is access to food. When a large prey has been captured, they have first rights to eat as much as they want, along with their offspring (pups). In times when food is scarce, the other adults in the pack may do better to disperse and fend for themselves. However, wolves tend to feed amicably when food is ample.In large packs of wolves there is sometimes a \u2018second in command\u2019. These are known as the \u2018Beta wolf or wolves\u2019. Beta wolves typically take on the role of raising the alpha pairs offspring, often becoming surrogate mothers or fathers to the pups while the alpha pair are absent.Beta wolves are the most likely to challenge their superiors for the role of the alpha, though some betas seem content with being second and will sometimes even let lower ranking wolves push ahead of them for the position of alpha should circumstances make it necessary for this to happen (death of the alpha, etc.)Healthier alphas will fight his challenger intensely to keep his lead roll, sometimes resulting in each one being injured. The loser is usually chased away or may be killed as other aggressive wolves contribute to the opposition. This kind of dominance encounter is more common during the mating season.Wolf rank order within a pack is established and maintained through a series of \u2018ritualised fights\u2019 and posturing best described as \u2018ritual bluffing\u2019. Wolves prefer psychological warfare to physical confrontations, meaning that high-ranking status is based more on personality or attitude than on size or physical strength.Rank, who holds it, and how it is enforced varies widely between packs and between individual animals. In large packs full of easygoing wolves, or in a group of juvenile wolves, rank order may shift almost constantly.\u00a0",
            "wolf howling": "Wolves howl for many reasons. Wolves howl as a way of communicating with other wolves. Wolves howl when they are rallying for a hunt, mourning, communicating with another pack of wolves or when a pack member has become separated \u2013 a lost wolf howls and the other members of his pack respond, giving him a sound to guide him home. Pack members recognise each others voices.Howling can also serve as a declaration of territory or a sign of protection such as protecting a fresh kill.Large packs of wolves will howl more than smaller packs of wolves. This is because smaller packs do not want to draw un-necessary attention to themselves. Adjacent packs may respond to each others howls, which can mean trouble for the smaller of the two. Therefore, wolves tend to howl with great care.Wolves howl at various levels of tones and pitches which tends to prevent a listener from accurately estimating the number of wolves involved. This concealment of numbers makes a listening rival pack wary of what action to take. For example, confrontation could mean bad news if the rival pack gravely underestimates the howling packs numbers. People have often guessed, based on listening to howls, that a pack of wolves contained up to 20 individuals, when there were only 3 or 4.Wolves tend to howl the most during the twilight hours, usually before the adults go and hunt and on their return. Wolves also tend to howl more during their breeding season and throughout rearing of pups.The wolf pups in turn will begin to howl and will be provoked into howling sessions quite easily. Such random howling usually has a communicative intent and has no adverse consequences so early in a wolfs life. Howling becomes less random as wolves learn to distinguish howling pack members from rival wolves.There are many misconceptions regarding the reasons why wolves howl. Contrary to popular belief, wolves do not howl for the sake of howling at the moon and despite the traditional imagery, wolves do not always sit when they howl \u2013 they often remain standing. Under ideal conditions, a wolfs howl can be heard from as far away as 10 miles (16 kilometres). A wolf howl can last between 3 and 11 seconds at a time.In addition to howls, wolves can also produce whimpers, growls, barks and squeaks. Whimpering tends to serve as either a submissive or friendly greeting sound, since young wolf pups and wolves attempting to appear submissive often whimper.Wolves growl when they are attempting to threaten another wolf or are behaving aggressively. Wolves rarely bark, however, they may do so as an alarm call or during play. Captive wolves who have been exposed to domestic dogs may bark more often than wild wolves or captive wolves who have not been exposed to domestic dogs.\u00a0",
            "wolf diet and hunting": "Wolves usually hunt in packs or sometimes individually. A wolf will nearly always eat what it catches almost completely. Wolves have more advantages when hunting in packs because they are intelligent animals working together and are able to take down animals that are much larger and stronger than an individual wolf. Wolves are strict carnivores and to stay alive, all animals require to eat some sort of food to provide energy and nutrients for their body. Wolves do not kill for sport, but for survival.Wolves are scavengers and hunters and will eat anything they catch from large mammals to small rodents. Some of the animals wolves hunt and eat include: deer, moose, caribou, elk, bison and musk-oxen as well small animals such as beaver, hares and other small rodents.Wolves have large stomachs and can devour 20 \u2013 25 pounds of food at any one feeding time. However, wolves are able to survive without food for up to 2 weeks or even longer if prey is scarce. Their digestion is very efficient, with all but 5 percent of large meat feeds able to be digested. Any splinters of bone that are not broken down somehow become wrapped in undigested hair, which protects the intestines from injury.Pups are fed by the adults who regurgitate fresh meat from their stomachs, or carry back fresh pieces of meat to the den. Wolves play an important role to other animal herds. Because wolves only hunt and eat sick or weak animals, they are actually helping the herds regain strength by ridding them of burden animals.For example, there is a sick deer in a herd which is eating food that could be used to feed healthy young deer. So by eliminating the sick deer, not only will it reduce the possibility of this deer infecting other deer and weakening the herd more, it will make more food available to needy youngsters and therefore performs an important natural function in the eco-system.Wolves live and hunt mainly in their own territory. The pack members will guard and defend their territory from other intruding wolves. Territory size depends on the availability of prey. Should prey be scarce, territory size can be as small as 25 \u2013 30 square miles, however, if prey is plentiful, wolf territory can cover up to 80 \u2013 90 square miles.A hunt will begin with pack members gathering, greeting each other and howling. These howls will deter other wolves from entering into the packs territory. The wolves commence their hunt by wading through their territory until they come across an animal for prey.The wolf will approach the prey in the opposite direction of the wind to avoid the animal from detecting the wolf scent and running away. The wolves will close in slowly, sometimes in single file.As soon as their prey is aware it is being pursued and tries to escape, the chase begins. The wolves chase their prey and once caught, bite their animals by attacking the rump or sides. Large animals with horns are usually attacked this way so the wolves avoid being injured by the horns which are used as weapons against the wolves. Once down, the animal will be weakened and killed with a bite to the throat or snout. Then it is dragged away for all to feed upon.Wolf hunts can either last minutes or hours depending on whether attacks are successful or not. If an attack fails, the wolves will continue to hunt until they are successful. It is a matter of survival.\u00a0",
            "wolf reproduction": "The mating season of wolves can occur anytime between January and March. Only the alpha male wolf and female wolf in a pack mate. (This is to prevent over-population).The alpha female wolf has only 5 to 7 days of estrus (when she is able to conceive). During this time, the alpha pair will sometimes move out of the pack temporarily to prevent interruption from other pack members.If other adult wolf members of the pack mate, the alpha female wolf will be aggressive towards the other female wolf and usually the alpha male wolf will chase the other adult male wolf out of the pack.It is common for one litter of pups to be born to one pack of wolves. It is rare for two litters to occur unless the alpha male has mated with another subordinate female. This is usually when the alpha female wolf gets aggressive. The alpha female will try to prevent this by aggressively dominating other females and physically separating them from the alpha male wolf during the mating season.When breeding season arrives breeding wolves begin to get more affectionate with each other. This occurs in anticipation of the females ovulation cycle. When the female finally goes into a period called \u2018estrus\u2019, the alpha male and alpha female wolves spend a lot of time together usually in seclusion. Pheromones in the females urine and the swelling of her vulva, tell the male she is ready to mate.During the first 5 days of estrus, the female will shed a lining of her uterus and will be unreceptive to the male. Following this, she will begin ovulation and mating will occur.During the period of mating, the two wolves become physically inseparable for anywhere between 10 and 30 minutes, during which time the male wolf will ejaculate multiple times.The mating ordeal is repeated many times throughout the females brief ovulation period, which occurs once per year per female (unlike female dogs, with whom estrus usually occurs twice per year). It is believed that both male and female wolves can continue to breed in this manner until at least 10 years of age.\u00a0\u00a0Once the alpha pair have mated, the gestation period lasts from 60 \u2013 63 days. Wolf pups are born blind, deaf and completely dependant on their mother. There can be between 1 \u2013 14 pups in one litter, with the average number being 4 \u2013 6 pups. For the first 8 weeks, the pups will stay inside the den in which they were born.The den is usually on high ground, near and open water source. During this time, the pups will grow and become more independent. The wolf pups will begin to explore the area just outside the den, gradually roaming up to a mile away from it.At 4 weeks old, the pups milk teeth have appeared and they begin to eat regurgitated food. At 6 weeks old they are weaned. During the first few weeks the pups are developing, the alpha mother will stay with them alone.Eventually, the rest of the pack will join in with the rearing of the pups in some way or other. The wolf pups stand a better chance of surviving when more wolves contribute to their care, such as bringing them food and guarding them from danger.At 2 months old, the wolf pups will be moved to a safe place which they will reside in while some of the adult wolves go hunting. One or two adult wolves will of course stay behind to watch over the pups and keep them safe.After a few more weeks of development and growing, the wolf pups are sometimes allowed to join in on the hunts. The wolf pups are only allowed as observers, however, until they are about 8 months old, by which time they are large enough to actively participate. The wolf pups receive first rights on anything killed regardless of their low rank within the pack.Letting the wolf pups fight for the right to eat, results in a secondary ranking being formed among them and lets them practice the dominance and submission rituals that will be essential to their future survival in pack life.Wolves typically reach sexual maturity when they are around 2 \u2013 3 years old. At this time, a wolf may feel the need to disperse from its pack, find a mate and start a pack of its own in its own territory.\u00a0",
            "wolf conservation status": "Wolves were mistakenly viewed as a pest species and almost exterminated. We are more enlightened today, although this opinion still remains among farmers. Through the efforts of ecologically-minded people and with the Endangered Species Act funding, the wolf is being reintroduced in parts of North America.With an increasing number of animals throughout the world either in a critically endangered situation, becoming endangered or a threatened species, wolves are no exception. Many projects are being carried out to reintroduce many wolf species such as the USFWS in North America and the International Wolf Centre.\u00a0",

Unlike bears, wombats are not predators but shy, timid animals that can make good, playful and affectionate pets. There are 3 species of wombat endemic to Australia with the Common Wombat being the most well known species. The other 2 species are the Southern Hairy-nosed Wombat (Lasiorhinus latrifrons) and the Northern Hairy-nosed Wombat (Lasiorhinus krefftii).",

They have large heads, short, powerful legs with powerful claws, thick set, muscular bodies and rodent-like front teeth suitable for their burrowing way of life.A wombats fur can vary in color from a sandy brown, grey to black. The Common Wombat can be distinguished from the other 2 species by its hairless nose and rounded ears. Being burrowing marsupials, wombats differ in that their pouches face backwards so that the young are protected from flying dirt when the female is digging.Wombats have a thick leathery skin on their rump which they use to block burrow entrances against predators.",
            "habitat": "The preferred habitats of a wombat is hilly or mountainous coastal country, creeks and gullies.",
            "diet": "Wombats are herbivores and feed up on grass, roots of shrubs and tress and fungi. They can graze for up to 8 hours a night and travel quite far from their burrows in search of food.",
            "behaviour": "Wombats are burrowers and will dig out burrows measuring 30 metres (100 feet) long. Burrows will have one entrance but may branch out into different chambers. The wombat makes its nest in one of these chambers and it will be lined with grass, bark and leaves.Wombats are usually nocturnal but will sometimes bask in the sun in specially prepared spots close to the entrance of its burrow. Wombats live in large home ranges and although they tend to be solitary, neighbouring territories can overlap considerably.Although wombats are sometimes aggressive towards each other in captivity, some observations suggest that they often make visits to each others burrows in the wild. When a wombat is startled or threatened, they can flee at around 25 miles per hour and maintain this speed for up to 90 seconds. Main predators of wombats are Tasmanian Devils and Dingoes.",
            "reproduction": "Wombats reach sexual maturity at 2 years of age. Births occur in late Autumn when 1 \u2013 2 young are born after a gestation period of 20 \u2013 28 days. Like all marsupials, wombat babies (joeys) are born under-developed and immediately enter its mother\u2019s pouch where it will stay attached to a teat, suckling milk, until it is fully developed. The young usually leave the pouch when they are 6 \u2013 7 months old and are weaned after 15 months.",
            "conservation status": "Wombats are a protected species but are persecuted in some regions for being vermin. Common wombats are classified by the IUCN Red List as a species of least concern. Northern Hairy-nosed Wombats (Lasiorhinus krefftii) are a critically endangered species and considered close to extinction. They are now very rare with only a small population in a National Park in Central Queensland. Their severe decline is due to loss of habitat to cattle. The Southern Hairy-nosed Wombat is also an endangered species."

Worms do not have arms, legs or bones, instead, they have a soft, often segmented body which is covered a tiny hairs or bristles that help them move along.

They also excrete equivalent to their own body weight daily in what is known as \u2018castings\u2019. (You may have seen castings in your garden, they look like little worms all curled up and look like mud). These castings produce compost and enriches the soil.Worms usually eat while they are passing through the soil and excrete as they go along. The soil they eat passes through two parts of their body called the \u2018Crop\u2019 and the \u2018Gizzard\u2019. In these parts of the worms body, strong muscles grind the soil, and digestive juices turn the plant matter into a digestible form. In the worms intestines, nutrients the worm needs are absorbed into its bloodstream to keep it strong, healthy and shiny and anything unwanted is passed out in a worm cast.Having worms in your garden is a good sign that you have healthy soil. Some people even keep worms as pets and feed them on scraps of waste so that they will make lots of healthy compost for their gardens so their plants and flowers will grow well.So, these strange little slimy creatures are extremely useful indeed \u2013 so remember this when you see them wriggling in your garden and perhaps get them some scraps of waste to eat.The best time to catch these little \u2018soil scientists\u2019 is when it is or has been raining as they come to the surface of the garden, probably to get a bit of moisture."

This opens up access to breeding grounds and increases the availability of food in general. It is during this season that the X-Ray fish has evolved to breed.The X-ray fish lays eggs. While the grasslands and marshes are flooded, the X-ray fish will scatter 300-400 eggs amongst the blades of grass and other vegetation. Fry will hatch as soon as 24 hours later and are free-swimming within a few days. At this point they can access more and more food sources and develop their characteristic adult markings soon after, reaching sexual maturity by about 5-8 months of age.Most individuals live for 3-4 years in the wild.

While protected, these measures are rarely effectively enforced.Removal of the Endangered Species Act in the US would severely affect this species. Illegal hunting during the 1970s and 80s is the primary reason for these low numbers, and organised poaching (e.g. Brazil) still remains one of the major threats to the species along with habitat destruction.Like the Common Caiman (Caiman crocodilus), the Yacare Caiman is able to breed relatively quickly in comparison with other species of crocodilians. This has helped to reduce the effects of hunting pressure.Sustainable yield programs are in operation in three countries, with the fourth (Paraguay) in the process of setting up such a program.Cropping of wild populations occurs in Bolivia, and ranching and farming programs are underway in both Brazil and Argentina.Both of these need to be further developed in conjunction with improved habitat management, education, and studies of wild population dynamics.

In the Spring, the fertilized queen will establish a colony, build a paper nest containing 30 \u2013 50 brood cells and lay from 10 \u2013 20 eggs there.The queens feed the young larvae for around 18 \u2013 20 days. The larvae then pupates and then emerges as infertile female workers. By mid-June, the first adult workers emerge and assume the tasks of making the nest larger, foraging for food, caring for the queen and larvae, and defending the colony.From this time until her death in the autumn, the queen remains inside the nest laying eggs. The colony then expands rapidly reaching a maximum size of 4,000 to 5,000 workers and a nest of 10,000 to 15,000 cells in August and late September.Yellowjacket wasp nests usually last for only one season, dying off in winter. The nest is started by a single queen, called the foundress, and typically can reach the size of a basketball by the end of the season.In parts of Australia , New Zealand, the Pacific Islands and southwestern coastal areas of the United States, the winters are mild enough to allow nest over wintering. Nests that survive multiple seasons become massive and often possess multiple egg-laying queens."

            "desc": "The Yellow Sac Spider (Cheiracanthium inclusum) is also known as the Black-Footed Spider. The Yellow Sac Spider is one of a group of spiders in North America whose bites are generally considered to be medically significant. The Yellow Sac Spider is very common in most of the United States and is the cause of a lot of spider bites and other unwanted encounters. Yellow Sac Spiders are light yellow to pale yellowish green, sometimes with a orange-brown stripe on top of the abdomen. The cephalothorax (fused head and thorax) of the Yellow Sac Spider is orange brown to reddish and the abdomen is pale yellow to light grey. An adult female sac spiders body is typically 1/4 to 3/8 inches long and its leg span is up to 1 inch. Males are more slender, with a slightly larger leg span. The first pair of legs is longer than the fourth. Yellow Sac Spiders have eight similarly-sized dark eyes arranged in two horizontal rows.",

The first pair of legs is longer than the fourth. Yellow Sac Spiders have eight similarly-sized dark eyes arranged in two horizontal rows.",
            "yellow sac spider habitat and webs": "Yellow Sac Spiders take shelter in flattened silk tubes during the day and move about to hunt during the night. Yellow Sac Spiders often live in houses and can frequently be found crawling upon walls or other vertical surfaces. Yellow Sac Spiders construct a silken tube or sac in a protected area, such as within a leaf, under landscape timbers or logs, or at the junction of a wall and ceiling and they use this sac as their daytime retreat. This is how the Yellow Sac Spiders derives its common name, sac spider. These spiders do not build webs.",
            "yellow sac spider diet": "Yellow Sac Spiders are active hunters, emerging at twilight from their silken sac to seek out prey. Yellow Sac Spiders prey is a wide diet of arthropods, including spiders larger than themselves and even their own eggs. Outdoors, they often search among foliage, waving their first pair of legs in front of them as they rapidly climb among leaves and stems of plants. Because of their active searching habits, Yellow Sac Spiders often enter homes, particularly during early autumn when their food supply decreases.",
            "yellow sac spider reproduction": "After mating, females Yellow Sac Spiders produce around 5 egg sacs each containing 30 to 48 eggs. The eggs are laid in a loose mass and covered with a thin coat of spun silk. The small, white, paper-like sacs are often found in easily overlooked locations, along ceilings and corners, or behind pictures and shelves. The female may guard these egg sacs until the eggs hatch. Eggs are usually laid in autumn and the spiderlings emerge during the following spring. The female may produce several egg masses during her lifetime. Adults can be found from April through November, however, in the hottest months small spiders makes up the largest proportion of the population.",
            "yellow sac spider venom": "The chelicerae of Yellow Sac Spiders are very powerful and the fangs can penetrate human skin quite easily. Most bites on humans occur when people are gardening or performing other kinds of outdoor activities. The venom has mild and local cytotoxic (a toxic effect on cells) and neurotoxic (poisonous to nerve tissue, as to the brain or spinal cord) effects. No fatal incidents from encounters with the yellow sac spider have ever been recorded. It has been noted that a large number of bites attributed to the Brown Recluse spider may actually be the result of yellow sac spider bites."

Their closest relatives besides other marmots are the woodchucks that are so common in the eastern U.S. They are generally just shy of two feet long, varying in size from 45 to 57 centimeters long, with tails of 13 to 22 centimeters. Males are generally heavier than females. Weights vary from two to five kilograms. As their name implies, they generally have yellow or yellowish-brown straight fur on their undersides, with white tips. Lastly, the typical lifespan of these marmots is 13 to 15 years."

The Yellow-eyed penguin is the third largest penguin behind the Emperor penguin, the largest and the king penguin being the second largest. Rarest of all the penguins, the Yellow-eyed penguin is unique in appearance and behaviour. These solitary birds have experienced population declines in the last 50 years due to habitat loss and predation by introduced species.",
            "characteristics": "The Yellow-eyed penguin is a medium-sized penguin with pale yellow eyes, growing to approximately 65 centimetres in height. The average weight for an adult is 5 to 6 kilograms. The Yellow-eyed penguin has a pale yellow head with black feather shafts.There is a band of bright yellow running from its eyes around the back of the head. The juvenile has a greyer head with no band and their eyes have a grey iris.",
            "diet": "The Yellow-eyed penguin usually nests in forest or scrub. It feeds mainly on blue cod, red cod, opal fish, sprat and squid.",
            "behaviour": "Yellow-eyed penguins spend most of their day at sea, feeding in the warm New Zealand waters. Amazing underwater swimmers, they can dive to depths of 400 feet and are adapted to holding their breath for up to four minutes. Yellow-eyed penguins may travel up to 20 miles from shore to feeding grounds at the edge of the Continental Shelf.Yellow-eyed penguins are forest nesting birds, preferring to nest in a secluded site backed up to a bank, tree or log. Coastal deforestation, however, has forced these penguins to seek refuge among tall shore grasses where adults, eggs and chicks frequently become prey to introduced dogs, cats, stoats, ferrets and rats.Although they nest in loose \u2018colonies\u2019, mated Yellow-eyed penguins seek solitude, often nesting out of sight of each other.",
            "reproduction": "During their lengthy breeding season, which runs from mid-August to mid-March, the penguins come ashore in the evening and waddle clumsily up the beach to their inland nest sites. In September to mid-October, females lay two eggs in nests of sticks and coarse grass which provide shelter from the hot sun and protection from storms.The incubation period is about 45 days and both parents keep watch over the eggs. The average hatching period on mainland New Zealand is the beginning of November. Both eggs usually hatch. At this point, one parent remains with the chicks while the other parent goes to sea to hunt for food. Unusual among penguins, the chicks stay with the parents and do not form \u2018cr\u00e8ches\u2019 (nursery groups) as most other penguin chicks do. Chicks fledge from mid-February to mid-March and are then able to head out to sea on their own to feed.",
            "predators": "Despite being swift swimmers, Yellow-eyed penguins can fall prey to seals and sharks at sea, though by far the biggest threats to their survival are on land. Significant protection measures have been introduced lately to curb population losses, including legislation aimed at reducing the numbers of non-native mammalian predators and slowing habitat loss.",
            "conservation": "The current status of the Yellow-eyed penguin is endangered, with an estimated population of 4,000. It is considered one of the worlds rarest penguin species. The main threats include habitat degradation, introduced predators as well as environmental changes. It is thought to be the most ancient of all living penguins."

The yellowhammer is a woodpecker. Males and females look similar. Juveniles are paler than adults. His black mustache makes him easy to identify as a male.",
            "habitat": "The yellowhammer is migratory and breeds in trees in open areas across eastern North America, unlike most woodpeckers.The yellowhammer beak is not as strong as other woodpeckers\u2019, so it generally pecks out a nest in soft wood from dead or dying trees. It may also take up residence in an abandoned bird\u2019s burrow or hole.",
            "diet": "The yellowhammers eat insects including ants, flies, caterpillars, snails, berries, nuts and seeds. They feed mostly on the ground rather than digging into trees like other woodpeckers; nevertheless, they may prey on insects in midair.",

Although zebras are very adaptable animals as far as their habitats are concerned, most zebras live in grasslands and savannas. The Grevy\u2019s zebra (Equus grevyi) prefers to live in sub desert and arid grasslands. Zebras were the second species to diverge from the earliest proto-horses, after the asses, around 4 million years ago. The Grevy\u2019s zebra is believed to have been the first zebra species to emerge.",
            "zebra characteristics": "Zebras are generally 2.3 metres (8 feet) long, stand 1.25 \u2013 1.5 metres (4 \u2013 5 feet) at the shoulder and weigh around 300 kilograms (660 pounds), although some can grow to more than 410 kilograms (900 pounds).Zebras have excellent hearing and eyesight and are capable of running at speeds of up to 40 miles per hour. Zebras bodies are well adapted to their surroundings. Zebras have long, thin legs for ease of movement and quick, efficient escapes from predators.Zebras have horse like bodies, however, their manes are made of short, erect hair, their tails are tufted at the tip and their coats are striped.Zebras are best known for their distinctive white and black stripes, which come in different patterns unique to each individual. Their stripes are a form of camouflage called \u2018disruptive coloration\u2019 that breaks up the outline of the body so it is difficult to make them out particularly in the dawn light when predators are most active.Zebras have matching incisors for chewing the strong, high fibre grasses which are easily digested due to their single stomach and hind-gut fermentation.",
            "zebra behaviour": "Zebras are very courageous animals and are not afraid to confront predators. Zebras also have a powerful kick which can cause serious injury to a predator such as a lion, hyena or African wild dog.Zebras are gregarious animals who congregate in herds of up to 1000 individuals. They live in family groups of between 5 \u2013 20 individuals that consist of one stallion, a few mares and their young ones. These basic family groups stay together even when they do congregate into large herds. Zebras stay in these family groups for many years.If one of the family group ever goes astray and is lost, the rest of the group will spend many days looking for it. If a member of the group becomes sick or is injured, the rest of the group will adjust its pace to accommodate it. When in these large herds, the stallion will spend most of his time chasing off other stallions from other family groups.Each group of zebra have their own home range. The adult zebras are usually non-related as both female and male zebra leave their natal origin. Within each family group, the stallion will have mating rights to his mares. The mares within the family group become associated for life. When the mares produce foals, they have added protection from the stallion who is always ready to defend his mates and offspring.Family groups will congregate with other family groups and bachelor herds to form larger herds, especially during migration. Within each individual family group, there is a female hierarchy. The longer the mare has been in the group, the more dominance she has. The alpha mare comes first, followed by her offspring. Then the second longest member comes next, with her offspring and so on.While migrating, the group hierarchy will stay in this order and walk in single file for many miles. The stallions will either lead or follow at the rear of the herd. This is so they can protect the mares and foals from predators.Most zebras are considered nomadic, without specific territories, except the Grevy\u2019s zebra who mark their territories with urine and dung. Zebras communicate with each other with sounds and facial expressions. Zebras make loud braying or barking sounds and soft snorting or whuffling sounds.The position of a Zebras ears and how wide open their eyes are and whether their mouths are open or their teeth are bared, all mean something. For example, when their ears are laid flat in a backwards position it means they mean business or to the other members of the group \u2013 \u2018you had better follow orders\u2019.Social grooming also produces bonds between the mares. Zebras will use their teeth and lips to nibble along the neck, shoulders and backs of their grooming partners. Most grooming partners are friendly mares, mares and foals or siblings. Grooming also helps ease aggression and confirm social status within the groups.Zebras tend to be more active during daylight. They spend their nights on short pastures where it is relatively safe from predator ambush. During the night, they will graze an hour or so at a time and move around very little. Other zebras sleep soundly, however, there is always one standing alert and on guard.At daybreak in warm weather, zebra herds begin filing to pastures of longer grass and may cover many miles before settling for another night. Mass movements between pastures and sleeping grounds and to water at midday, are also peaks of social activity.Zebras like to associate with other animals such as baboons, giraffes, impala and kudu, however, the most common association is between the zebra and the wildebeest. Unlike their closest relatives, horses and donkeys, zebras have not been truly domesticated.",
            "zebra reproduction": "Zebra foals are born after an 11 to 12 month gestation period. The young zebra is able to stand shortly after birth and able to walk within 15 minutes of birth and can run after only an hour.Newborns have a mane down the back to the tail and are brown, black and white. Zebra foals begin to change to adult coloration after 4 months. Although a foal may graze within a week of birth, they continue to suckle for up to 16 months. The average infant mortality is about 50%, mostly due to predation by lions and spotted hyena.",
            "zebra species": "There are three live species of zebra, with several subspecies. The fourth one, the Quagga Zebra (Equus quagga quagga), is extinct. However, aims to reintroduce the Quagga Zebra have been attempted by selective breeding on the \u2018Quagga Project\u2019 started by Reinhold Rau in South Africa. It was reported that the third and fourth generations of the project have produced animals which look very much like the depictions and preserved specimens of the Quagga.\u00a0Out of the 3 main zebras species, it is the Grevy\u2019s Zebra (Equus grevyi) which is the largest and has many more narrower stripes than the other 2.
